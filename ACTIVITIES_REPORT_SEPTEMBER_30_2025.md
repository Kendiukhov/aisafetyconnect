## ACTIVITIES PERFORMED

### 1. REQUEST LOGIC OPTIMIZATION (2 hours)
**Schedule**: 11:00 - 13:00

#### Problems identified:
- Aggressive rate limiting (frequent 429 errors)
- Insufficient delays for users without API key
- Batch size not optimized for shared pool

#### Solutions implemented:
- **RPS target**: 0.30 req/s (shared pool without API key)
- **Batch size**: 35 results per page
- **Adapted delays**: BASE_DELAY ≈ 3.33s, MIN_DELAY = 3.0s
- **Improved backoff**: Up to 120s with short jitter
- **Retries**: Maximum 2 per request

#### Code modified:
```python
# Rate by policy for users without API key
self.has_api_key = bool(self.api_key)
self.RPS_TARGET = 0.95 if self.has_api_key else 0.30
self.BATCH_SIZE = 50 if self.has_api_key else 35

# Derived delays + short jitter (compliance)
self.BASE_DELAY = max(1.05, 1.0 / self.RPS_TARGET)
self.MIN_DELAY = 1.0 if self.has_api_key else 3.0
self.MAX_DELAY = 2.0 if self.has_api_key else 4.0
self.MAX_BACKOFF_DELAY = 120.0
```

### 2. INTELLIGENT STOPPING IMPLEMENTATION (1 hour)
**Schedule**: 13:00 - 14:00

#### Objective:
Avoid useless calls when no new papers are found

#### Implementation:
- **Global counter**: `consecutive_zero_new`
- **Threshold**: 15 consecutive queries without new papers
- **Logic**: If threshold is reached, stop extraction immediately

#### Code implemented:
```python
consecutive_zero_new = 0
zero_new_threshold = 15

# In main loop
if result.get('papers_new', 0) > 0:
    consecutive_zero_new = 0
else:
    consecutive_zero_new += 1
    if consecutive_zero_new >= zero_new_threshold:
        logger.warning("Zero new papers threshold reached. Stopping extraction.")
        break
```

### 3. EXHAUSTIVE EXTRACTION EXECUTION (4 hours)
**Schedule**: 14:30 - 18:30

- **Temporal filter**: 2015-2025
- **Batch size**: 35 papers per page

#### Results:
- **Queries executed**: 397/397 (100% completed)
- **Papers processed in session**: 9,530
- **Unique papers in DB**: 12,371
- **Total citations**: 215,675
- **Coverage**: 100% with URLs and PDFs

- **Technical AI Governance**: Completed

### 4. RANKINGS GENERATION (1 hour)
**Schedule**: 18:30 - 19:30

#### Scripts created:

#### Rankings generated:
1. **Top 100 Papers by Citations** (`top_papers_by_citations.csv`)
   - Paper #1: "Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks" - 12,741 citations
   - Paper #2: "The Use of Cronbach's Alpha When Developing and Reporting Research Instruments" - 7,667 citations
   - Paper #3: "Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science" - 6,744 citations

2. **Top Papers by Year** (`top_papers_by_year.csv`)
   - 550 papers distributed by year (2015-2025)
   - Top 50 papers per year

3. **Top Papers by Venue** (`top_papers_by_venue.csv`)
   - 5,985 papers distributed by venue
   - 3,258 unique venues
   - Top 20 papers per venue

### 5. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTS (0.5 hours)
**Schedule**: 19:30 - 20:00

## PROBLEMS SOLVED

### 1. Aggressive Rate Limiting
- **Problem**: Frequent 429 errors with 2.5s delays
- **Solution**: 3.33s base delays + backoff up to 120s
- **Result**: Successful rate limit handling without interruptions

### 2. Inefficient Deduplication
- **Problem**: 8.4% efficiency (1,047 processed → 88 unique)
- **Solution**: In-memory anti-duplication + UPSERT by paper_id
- **Result**: 100% efficiency (12,371 unique)

### 3. Redundant Queries
- **Problem**: Excessive overlap between queries
- **Solution**: Exhaustive taxonomy without artificial limits
- **Result**: Complete coverage of all combinations

### 4. Lack of Intelligent Stopping
- **Problem**: Useless calls after reaching limits
- **Solution**: Counter for streaks without new papers
- **Result**: System implemented (not needed in this run)
