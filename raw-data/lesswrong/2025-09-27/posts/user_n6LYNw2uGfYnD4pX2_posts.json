Ты ловец.\n\n— Это Зеркало позволяет спрятать предмет до тех пор, пока не появится кто-то с правильными намерениями, — раздражённо сказал Гарри.\n\n— Я ищу вход в гостиную Когтеврана, — сказала Луна Зеркалу. — Я хочу поспать в кровати.\n\n— Во имя Гёделя, какую же чудовищно сложную загадку задал тебе бронзовый орёл!? — спросил Гарри.\n\n— «Где моя диадема?» — сказала Луна.\n\n— Нужно было ответить «потеряна» или «спрятана», — сказал Гарри. — От тебя не ожидали, что ты действительно найдёшь Потерянную Диадему Когтеврана.\n\n— А, — сказала Луна.\n\n— Раз уж мы уже здесь, давай постараемся, — сказал Гарри, доставая из мешочка механический секундомер и устанавливая его на пять минут.\n\n— Я хочу диадему, чтобы спасти мир, — сказал Гарри.\n\n— Я стремлюсь спасти жизни всех разумных существ, — сказал Гарри.\n\n— Я обещаю вернуть тебя к жизни, Ровена Когтевран, — сказал Гарри.\n\n— Я хочу разбирать звёзды на части, — сказал Гарри.\n\nЛуна не обращала на него внима",

А Хогвартс — лишь часть от этого. Если Гарри Поттер раскроет миру существование больницы, это может вызвать международный кризис. И в тот день Верховному Чародею было бы крайне выгодно, чтобы Каменная Цитадель находилась внутри защитных чар Хогвартса.\n\nПрошло ещё три минуты и пятьдесят четыре секунды. Умер ещё один человек — навсегда. В эпоху неадекватности цивилизационного масштаба — то есть постоянно — Гарри Поттер понимал удовольствие Лорда Волдеморта от того, что он прорывался через бюрократию Министерства с помощью убийств.\n\n* * *\n\nВ дверь постучали. Мечтательный голос первокурсницы сказал:\n\n— Я ищу Гарри Поттера.\n\n— Гарри Джеймс Поттер-Эванс-Веррес сейчас занят. Он пытается спасти и/или уничтожить мир и/или волшебный род, — ответил Гарри. — Если вы запишетесь на приём, он, возможно, ответит вам через несколько эпох.\n\n— А Том Риддл свободен? — спросил голос. — Он знает, для чего нужны астролябии?\n\n* * *\n\nЛуна была не обучена магловской науке. Профессор магловедения Бёрбидж заявила, что астролябия выходит за рамки её компетенции, и направила Луну к Гарри Поттеру. На карте Мародёров «Гарри Поттера» не было, поэтому Луна направилась в «Офис Гарри Поттера». Дверь открыл Том Риддл.\n\n— Приятно познакомиться, мистер Риддл, — сказала Луна.\n\nТом Риддл впустил Луну в кабинет Гарри Поттера, закрыл дверь и наложил тридцать защитных чар.\n\n— Называй меня Гарри Поттер, — сказал Том Риддл.\n\n— Называй меня Ты-Знаешь-Кто, — Луна подыграла. Было облегчением хоть на время притвориться, что у неё есть друзья.\n\n— Хсс хщсссс хсс, — сказал Том Риддл на парселтанге.\n\n— Ссс ссс сс, — сказала Луна не-на-парселтанге. Она вытянула указательные пальцы вниз от рта, как клыки, и закачала головой, имитируя змею.\n\n— Ты не настоящий Ты-Знаешь-Кто, — сказал Том Риддл.\n\n— А ты не настоящий Гарри Поттер, — Луна показала ему карту. — Тут же написано.\n\nДвенадцатилетний мальчик начал мысленно биться головой о стену. То, что ты выиграл сражение, ещё не значит, что ты вел себя оптимально. Оптимальное поведение — это когда ты извлекаешь максимальную полезность из обстоятельств. Он не должен был довольствоваться возвращением своих вещей. Надо было грабить тела павших врагов подчистую. Если бы он так сделал, Беллатриса Лестрейндж уже была бы в Министерской тюрьме, Картой Мародёров владел бы он, а его личность оставалась бы в безопасности.\n\n— Чего ты хочешь? — спросил мальчик.\n\n— Я хочу друзей, — сказала Луна. — Но сейчас мне хватит и Потерянной Диадемы Кандиды Когтевран. Я пришла в офис Гарри Поттера, потому что профессор Бёрбидж сказала, что он эксперт в современной магловской технологии.\n\n— Я расскажу тебе, что такое астроля́бия, если ты с этого момента будешь делать вид, что я — Гарри Джеймс Поттер-Эванс-Веррес.\n\n— Договорились, — сказала Луна.\n\n— Астролябия — это компактная модель Вселенной, — сказал Гарри. — А что такое Потерянная Диадема Кандиды Когтевран?\n\n— Диадема — это корона, — сказала Луна. — Говорят, что диадема Когтевран делает тебя умнее.\n\nГарри Поттер уже слышал выражение «взрыв интеллекта». Если Кандида Когтеран смогла создать магический артефакт, увеличивающий её когнитивные способности, то вряд ли она бы остановилась на этом. Она использовала бы первую диадему, чтобы сделать вторую — лучшую. Затем — третью, ещё совершеннее. Возможно, она бы не остановилась, пока не достигла Полной Сингулярности.\n\n— Знаешь что, — сказал Гарри, заталкивая бумажную волокиту по зонированию от Министерства в сундук, — спасение мира подождёт. Что ты ещё знаешь об этой Потерянной Диадеме?",

Она поднялась в башню Когтеврана, а затем, казалось, ещё выше. Её отделяла от первых друзей всего одна дверь с бронзовым дверным молотком в форме орла, который загадывал загадки, подходящие для первокурсников. Она почти слышала приглушённый шум вечеринки за дверью. Луна постучала один раз. Орёл заговорил голосом Кандиды Когтевран:\n\n— Где моя диадема?\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/8257dfc1199c251ba9236844f51da724e6ab1fd86894306e.jpg)\n\nУ Луны не было в запасе достаточно часов до завтрака, чтобы отыскать Потерянную Диадему Когтеврана. Она свернулась калачиком в нише недалеко от места, где из Гостиной сочилось тепло. Она написала благодарственную записку домовикам за то, что они держат пол в чистоте.\n\n— Я назову тебя Ванда, — сказала Луна своему Мозгошмыгу.\n\nВанда появилась на карте Мародёров. Луна щёлкнула языком, затем примотала банку прыского чая к уху лентой, чтобы Ванда могла питаться. Мозг Луны затуманился и она уснула.\n\n* * *\n\nЛуна проснулась от топота студентов Когтеврана, направляющихся на завтрак. Луна вытянула Ванду из уха. Кто-то положил одеяло на Луну, пока она спала. Луна сбросила одеяло, прежде чем кто-то заметил её и понял, что она не решила загадку. Она стукнула по орлу проверить, но загадка не изменилась.\n\nПо пути на завтрак Луна прошла мимо Забытой Библиотеки у подножия башни Когтеврана. Ей нужно было поесть, ведь она была человеком. Или она могла бы исследовать комнату, которая простояла тысячу лет и, вероятно, будет стоять ещё завтра. Вход в Забытую Библиотеку был серым семиугольником в стенe. Внутри излучался монохромный серый свет. Луна шагнула в Забытую Библиотеку.\n\nЛуна вышла из Забытой Библиотеки. Она проверила свою сумку — перо, пергамент и чернильница были на месте. Луна написала «Журнал Исследований» вверху пергамента. Луна вошла в Забытую Библиотеку.\n\nЛуна вышла из Забытой Библиотеки. В руках у неё был лист пергамента с заголовком «Журнал Исследований». Луна вошла в Забытую Библиотеку.\n\nЛуна вышла из Забытой Библиотеки. Она забыла свой Журнал Исследований внутри. Луна снова вошла в Забытую Библиотеку.\n\nЛуна вышла из Забытой Библиотеки. В руке у неё был пустой лист пергамента. Она пропустила свой первый урок Заклинаний. Если поторопиться, то ещё успеет на Боевую Магию. Карта Мародёров показывала короткий путь: от двери, замаскированной под окно, к окну, замаскированному под дверь. Луна оказалась на верхнем этаже прозаического геометрического пространства прямо перед классом Боевой Магии.\n\nПрофессор Локхарт продолжил традицию бывшего профессора Квиррелла — объединять все четыре факультета в один класс. Он также объединил все семь курсов в один. Присутствовали профессора Бёрбидж, Лапсуза, Синистра, Трелони, Вектор и Юэ, а также директриса Макгонагалл, мисс Пинс и мадам Помфри. Хогвартс вырастил астрономическую аудиторию в форме геодезического купола, с вращающимся Солнцем, чтобы Гилдерой Локхарт всегда был освещён в самом выгодном свете. Улыбка Гилдероя Локхарта кричала: «Я тебя люблю» — именно тебе. Да, Тебе.\n\n— Прежде чем мы начнём, я проведу демонстрацию. Протего, — сказал Локхарт. — На счёт три кто-нибудь выстрелит в меня заклятием. Раз…\n\nГилдерой Локхарт показывал эту демонстрацию десятки раз ведьмам и волшебникам по всему миру. Большинство из них не были дуэлянтами. Те же, кто был, обычно оказывались слишком удивлены, чтобы успеть произнести хоть одно заклинание.\n\nЭто было первое выступление Гилдероя Локхарта перед бывшими солдатами из армий предыдущего профессора — Квиррелла.\n\nСотня проклятий поразила Локхарта ещё до того, как он успел сказать «два». Кафедра преподавателя Защиты превратилась в расплавленный шлак. Его тело напоминало соплохвоста. Из разбитого купола валил фиолетовый дым. Преподаватели бросились ему на помощь. Директриса Макгонагалл эвакуировала студентов.\n\n* * *\n\nЛуна пошла обедать в Большой зал.\n\n— А вот и Луни Лавгуд, — кто-то сказал.\n\n— Сову завести не может, вот и притворяется, что у неё есть невидимый питомец.\n\n— Пишет записки домовикам, потому что у неё нет друзей.\n\n— Думает, что всё знает, а загадку своего бронзового орла решить не может.\n\n— Надо было её в Гриффиндор отправить.\n\nЛуна щёлкнула языком, позволяя Ванде питаться её мыслями. Она стащила обед с кухни, чтобы поесть в Забытой библиотеке.\n\n* * *\n\nЛеди Юэ заменила факелы в подземельях на свечи. На ней был наряд будущего участника исторических реконструкций, уверенного в том, как должна выглядеть современная ведьма. Болтовня гриффиндорцев и когтевранцев стихла при её появлении.\n\nЛеди Юэ стояла за столом, на котором стояли два дымящихся котла.\n\n— Что есть реальность? — спросила она у класса. — Лавгуд?\n\n— Реальность — это то, что можно наблюдать, — ответила Луна.\n\n— Пять очков Когтеврану, — вздохнула леди Юэ. Она подняла взгляд туда, где могла бы быть видна луна, если бы они не были в подземелье. На неё было достаточно просто взглянуть, чтобы понять: на улице идёт дождь.\n\nЛуна хотела обосновать свой ответ. Но леди Юэ наградила Луну за неправильный ответ — хотя Луна была права. Леди Юэ перехитрила Луну, поддержав её. Луна не могла сердиться. Но и удовлетворения не чувствовала.\n\nЛеди Юэ наложила чары незримости на первый котёл. Пар стал выглядеть так, словно проникал сквозь разрыв в пространстве.\n\n— Что есть реальность? — повторила леди Юэ.\n\nНесколько учеников снова подняли руки. Леди Юэ указала на Джинни Уизли.\n\n— Реальность — это всё, что имеет физическое или магическое проявление.\n\n— Пять очков Гриффиндору, — сказала леди Юэ. Джинни уставилась на свои туфли. Леди Юэ коснулась видимого котла. Он перестал существовать.\n\n— Я только что продемонстрировала два способа уничтожить форму. Чары незримости скрывают образ. Заклинание изгнания устраняет сущность в небытие, — сказала леди Юэ.\n\nЛуна начала поднимать руку, чтобы спросить, что случилось с третьим котлом. Леди Юэ остановила её взглядом. Щупальца её обратной легилименции прошептали: останься после урока.\n\n* * *\n\nДве ведьмы ждали, пока все остальные уйдут. В тишине Луна заметила, что леди Юэ двигалась бесшумно. Каждое её движение было выверено до мелочей.\n\nЛеди Юэ ждала, когда Луна сделает первый шаг. Луна приняла правила игры. Свечи догорели. Наступила кромешная тьма.\n\n— Вы Тёмный лорд? — спросила Луна.\n\n— Спасать и/или уничтожать мир — это мальчишеская игра, — сказала леди Юэ.\n\nЗемля и Луна вращались вокруг общего центра масс.\n\n— Жёсткая магия имеет форму, — сказала леди Юэ. — Её можно контролировать. Мягкая магия пуста; она без формы. Мягкая магия подавляется всеми организациями — от Департамента международного магического сотрудничества до клубика Лорда Волан-де-Морта.\n\n— Вы хотите сказать, что Тот-Кого-Нельзя-Называть не занимался Тёмными искусствами? — сказала Луна.\n\n— Минус пять очков Когтеврану, — сказала леди Юэ. — Во время Первой магической войны твоя мать участвовала в разработке секретного оружия, предназначенного для нейтрализации Лорда Волан-де-Морта.\n\n— Вы знаете, где найти Потерянную Диадему Когтеврана? — выпалила Луна. — А ещё можете объяснить, что такое наргл? И что случилось с платформой девять с половиной?\n\nДождь перешёл в грозу.\n\n— Это астролябия твоей матери. Она оставила её у меня перед смертью. Пришло время вернуть её тебе.",

Мы перечислим все комнаты и тайные проходы, которые нам известны, включая Тайную комнату. Мы их посчитаем. Затем ты наложишь сетку на эту карту. Мы посчитаем каждую комнату, не идентифицируя и не называя её. Потом сравним эти два числа.\n\nДва числа оказались равны.\n\n— Подождите минутку. У меня есть другая идея. Дайте мне этот список. Есть ли в замке комната, в которую вы не заходили? — сказала Луна.\n\n— Нет, — сказал Джордж, — Мы были во всех значительных местах кроме Тайной комнаты.\n\n— Давайте ещё раз посмотрим на карту, — сказала Луна, — Перечислите каждую комнату, в которую вы заходили.\n\n* * *\n\n— ...и вот это кладовка для мётел, в которую мы заперли Перси, вместе с его девушкой, бывшей девушкой, бывшей-бывшей девушкой и Пивсом, — закончил Фред.\n\nЛуна разорвала маленькие кусочки пергамента и покрыла каждую комнату, в которой побывали Фред и Джордж. Она закрыла почти всю карту Мародёров. Остались только несколько неважных комнат, которые особо и не считались, не стоили внимания. Затем Луна поймала себя на мысли: наверное, именно так ощущается заклинание отгоняющее маглов.\n\nЛуна нарочито прочитала вслух те неважные комнаты, которые она почти уже списала со счетов.\n\n*   Каменная цитадель (на стадии строительства)\n*   Тайная комната\n*   Забытая библиотека",

Леди Юэ будет преподавать Зельеварение, профессор Сьюзан Лапсуса — Трансфигурацию, а Боевую Магию будет преподавать … ох Мерлин… ГИЛДЕРОЙ ЛОКХАРТ.\n\nГилдерой Локхарт был признан величайшим боевым магом своего времени — современным Дэвидом Монро. Еженедельно \"Пророк\" печатал истории о его столкновениях с упырями, ведьмами, троллями, вампирами и оборотнями. Говорили, что на этой неделе он расскажет о встрече с йети в Антарктиде. У него было больше подтвержденных побед над тёмными магами, чем у лучшего аврора Министерства. Он пять раз выигрывал награду \"Самая Очаровательная Улыбка\" от \"Ведьмовского Еженедельника\".\n\nЗолотые волосы Гилдероя струились в идеально выверенной небрежности. Он выпрямил плечи так, будто только что спас мир. И этот нос —\n\n— Полумна Лавгуд! — крикнула профессор Лапсуса.\n\nЛуна вприпрыжку направилась к переднему ряду Большого Зала. Ученики хихикали. \"Такова цена, если твой отец говорит правду в лицо властям,\" — подумала Луна.\n\nРаспростившаяся над её головой до самых плеч, Распределяющая Шляпа заговорила:\n\n— Хмм… сложный случай. Очень сложный. Я вижу смелость, и немалую. И ум не подкачал. Немалый талант, ох, даже очень. И жажда доказать себя, это интересно… Так куда же тебя отправить?\n\n— Ты всем девочкам так говоришь? — подумала Луна. — Всем повторяешь, что мы сложные, смелые, талантливые и…\n\n— КОГТЕВРАН! — перебив, выкрикнула шляпа.\n\nЕда появилась на золотых тарелках. Луна задумалась, откуда она берётся.\n\n— Откуда берётся эта еда? — спросила она сидящего рядом мальчика со светло-рыжими волосами.\n\n— Она появляется из ничего, — ответил он.\n\n— Это невозможно, — возразила Луна. — Еда \\- одно из пяти главных Исключений Закона Гэмпа о Превращении.\n\n— Тогда откуда же она по-твоему берётся? — с раздражением сказал мальчик.\n\nСчётчик Провальных Попыток Луны Подружиться увеличился до пяти.\n\n* * *\n\n— Первокурсники, за мной, — позвал староста Когтеврана.\n\nЛогично предположить, что кухни расположены под Большим Залом. Луна выждала момент, когда старосты увели учеников, и пробралась в место под Большим Залом, известное как \"Кухонный коридор\". Там Луна услышала, как Староста Пуффендуя трижды постучал по одной из бочек приговаривая \"Хельга Хельга Хельга Пуффендуй\". Крышка огромной бочки открылась, и ученики прошли внутрь. Луна, дождавшись, пока пуффендуйцы скроются, стала обходить подземелье.\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c3217b04db023f29ffd8e4a73abdd53168350debdc8daa0b.jpg)\n\n\"Кухонный коридор\" был ярко освещён факелами. В углу громоздились бочки, маскируя вход в гостиную Пуффендуя. Стоял комплект доспехов, на стене было несколько картин, в основном с изображением еды. Это, вкупе с отсутствием видимых дверей поблизости, намекало, что вход на кухню скрыт здесь.\n\nНо как войти? Дверей не было. Луна постучала по картинам палочкой. Она решила попробовать ритм детской песенки \"рыба с картошкой\" — и её окатило уксусом. Она разговаривала с фруктами. Заглянула внутрь доспехов. Когда Луна напевала длинный поток тарабарщины перед огромной картиной с чашей фруктов, она внезапно распахнулась — и врезалась прямо в её нос, швырнув Луну через весь коридор в доспехи, которые с грохотом рухнули на неё.\n\nИз-за картины вывалились два одинаковых рыжих мальчишки, с охапками пирожных, печенья и кексов.\n\n— Episky, — один из близнецов взмахнул палочкой, балансируя пирамиду сладостей на левой руке, локте, плече и боку головы. Кровотечение из носа остановилось.\n\n— Ты первокурсница? — спросил второй.\n\n— Да. Ищу вход на кухню, — ответила Луна.\n\n— Что ты уже пробовала? — спросил первый.\n\n— Стучала по всему подряд и бормотала тарабарщину.\n\n— Сработало?\n\n— Вот по этой бочке постучите в ритме \"рыба с картошкой\", — сказала Луна.\n\n* * *\n\n— Что ж, у нас тут ученица, которая в первый же день сбежала от старосты Когтеврана, чтобы пробраться на кухню, — сказал первый.\n\n— К тому же обнаружила вход, закрытый для студентов, и гостиную Пуффендуя, закрытую для Когтеврана, — добавил второй.\n\n— А затем окатила уксусом двоих старших учеников.\n\n— Мы могли бы сдать её властям.\n\n— Или использовать этот шанс…\n\n— Какие же шалости мы бы могли организовать с такой проказницей!",

Writing publicly on this website and submitting my ideas to the Internet has improved my rationality far better and faster than talking to people in real life. All of the best thinkers I'm friends with are good writers too. It's not even close. I believe this relationship is causal; learning to write well teaches you to think well. If you are a regular reader of this website and haven't written on it, then I recommend you try writing original posts. I expect you'll learn much faster. It increases your serendipity surface area too.\n\nIf you already do write on this website, then there is lots of alpha in writing different styles, such as [dialogues](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/djWftXndJ7iMPsjrp/the-dark-arts), [parables](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XD6BCyenoiy8329E8/the-pearly-gates), [games](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Tq8qeRxQ4pB3b5RKg/the-darwin-game-rounds-0-to-10), [research summaries](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JZZENevaLzLLeC3zn/predictive-coding-has-been-unified-with-backpropagation), [war reporting](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LCfaLXcWnk8pujnX4/russia-has-invaded-ukraine), [fiction](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qMtriMPLdriNkAfSJ/p/HjQrRiJeYFFSEfSKX), [fanfiction](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qMtriMPLdriNkAfSJ/p/pL4WhsoPJwauRYkeK), [fanfanfiction](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zb3hWt99i9Fm93KPq/luna-lovegood-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-part-1-1), and so on.\n\nI feel this website's moderators do a good job of selecting what gets frontpaged.

My solution was to learn a new communication medium—a new art form. But I have exhausted the easiest gains in the art of writing. I am well into the realm of diminishing returns. It is time to try something new.\n\nAt first, I experimented with YouTube and Reddit, but they are too similar to Less Wrong. To get out of my comfort zone, I needed something the opposite of Less Wrong in every possible way.\n\nThat's why I'm making TikTok videos.\n\nIt's so much fun! On Less Wrong, I can a post about Lagrangian mechanics and get comments from physicists and mathematicians. On TikTok, I got to teach a viewer that hurricanes lose energy as they pass over land. It's so much easier to [teach things](https://xkcd.com/1053/) when your audience is people who use TikTok.\n\nThank you all so, so much. It's been great preaching to the choir. But it's time to bring anti-religion to the heathens.\n\n[Here's a link to my TikTok channel.](https://www.tiktok.com/@lsusr)\n\nHappy April 1!\n",

Imagine if you went to a powerlifting gym and there were pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans on the wall to prove that it was possible to build muscle by lifting weights. And the photos contained only their faces—no body pics. I bet all the men in that gym would be skinny (or gay). The best teachers don't point to cult leaders. They rarely cite ancient texts or say \"from my experience\". They just tell you to pay attention to RIGHT NOW in a hundred different ways.\n\n<🔔 dingggggggggggg 🔔>\n\nI like drawing. In the past month, I've been to two art groups.\n\nOne group is an anti-racist anti-sexist collective. They're a growing community with two physical locations. Membership costs $150/month, and members are expected to contribute labor to the community. There's a long[^1x7mu83da0x] waiting list to become a member. They host regular events full of people who dress fashionably and talk fashionably. Their art sucks, by the way. It's ugly and boring, like the crap modern art museums are full of.\n\nMy drawing club meets at a coffee shop. The application process is \"show up\" and the membership requirements are \"buy a drink to support the coffee shop\". The table next to us plays Dungeons & Dragons. There's a woman with really obvious ADHD who tells entertaining stories while drawing her webcomic. The rest[^cz392rr66cp] of us are doing studies to get better at drawing. We like anime, webcomics, and classical technique.\n\n[^jreyci0fcni]: Not counting myself. \n\n[^vzv5hpglkaq]: He might be an arahant. I don't know if he is—and I've never asked. Ultimately, it doesn't matter. \n\n[^1x7mu83da0x]: The membership form asks for your race. I am curious if the waiting list is shorter for preferred races. \n\n[^cz392rr66cp]: Except for the husband of the organizer who is writing an emulator for the Nintendo DS because the code he writes at work is boring because it doesn't have enough bugs.

      "markdown": "Vegans are often disliked. That's what I read online and I believe there is an element of truth to to the claim. However, I eat a largely[^1] vegan diet and I have never received any dislike IRL for my dietary preferences whatsoever. To the contrary, people often happily bend over backwards to accommodate my quirky dietary preferences—even though I don't ask them to.\n\n[^1]: The details aren't important. What matters for the purpose of this post is that, in practice, it often looks to others as if a vegan.\n\nWhy is my experience so different from the more radical vegans? It's very simple. I don't tell other people what to eat, and they don't tell me what to eat. Everyone on Planet Earth knows that there people from other cultures with strange, arbitrary dietary guidelines. And by everyone, I mean *everyone*.\n\nI read a story about two European anthropologists living among the hunger-gatherers of New Guinea. One anthropologist was French; the other anthropologist was English. Meat was precious in the jungle, so the locals honored the anthropologists by offering them meat. Specifically, a disease-ridden rat, roasted over a fire. The Europeans didn't want to eat that, but they couldn't tell the New Guineans they thought it was gross, because that would be rude. The Frenchman choked down his half of the rat with a forced smile.\n\nThe Frenchman's precedent meant that the Englishman would have to eat his half of the rat too, right? Nope. The Englishman simply explained that he and the Frenchman were from different European tribes called \"French\" and \"English\", and that the English have a religious injunction that prohibits them from eating rats. Did the New Guinean hunter-gatherers become confused because Frenchmen and Englishmen look the same to them? Not at all. Every group of people on Planet Earth, from the streets of London to the jungles of New Guinea, understands that other people far away are divided into other cultures with arbitrary dietary rules. Fudging the difference between cultural injunctions vs religious injunctions is barely even a lie when you're talking to [polytheists](https://acoup.blog/category/collections/practical-polytheism/). Or atheist Jews, for that matter.\n\nThere are a handful of genocidal fascists who will force Muslims to eat pork, but most people aren't that evil. Normal people will respect Muslims' dietary rules, Buddhists' dietary rules, Hindus' dietary rules, Jews' dietary rules, Mormons' dietary rules, Quentians' dietary rules, celiacs and even just picky eaters. Many people hate Muslims, but nobody hates Muslims because they don't eat pork. Many people hate Jews too, but not because Jews refuse to eat shellfish. Quentians aren't even real. I just made that one up.\n\nWhy are vegans different? Because vegans don't always stop at \"I don't eat animal products.\" Noisy vegans follow it up with \"and you shouldn't either\". That's the problem.\n\n> **Recognize you only have a few \"weirdness points\" to spend.** Trying to convince all your friends to donate 50% of their income to MIRI, become a vegan, get a cryonics plan, and demand open borders will be met with a lot of resistance. But -- I hypothesize -- that if you pick one of these ideas and push it, you'll have a lot more success.\n>\n> ―[*You have a set amount of \"weirdness points\". Spend them wisely.*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wkuDgmpxwbu2M2k3w/you-have-a-set-amount-of-weirdness-points-spend-them-wisely) by Peter Wildeford\n\nThere's a big difference between you making choices according to your values, and you telling other people to make choices according to your values. If you tell other people they should make choices according to your values instead of their values, then other people won't like you. This isn't because you're being weird. It's because you're telling other people to do things they don't want to do.\n\nI often get my friends to eat vegan food. It doesn't cost me any weirdness points. To the contrary, my friends reciprocate with generosity. Here's how it works. I invite my friends over to dinner. I cook them dinner, or buy take-out. I insist on paying for everything, and refuse their offers to chip in. The food is vegan because I'm the one providing it. The food is tasty because I'm a good cook, because I know what all the good restaurants are, and because I know what kinds of foods my friends like. Do my friends complain that the food is vegan? Of course not. It doesn't even cross their mind. They're appreciative that I'm providing them with a tasty dinner.\n\nWhen [I bring friends to my Zendo](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/J9jj2EY6kuBRJ4CXE/proselytizing), that doesn't cost me \"weirdness points\", either. To the contrary, it builds my credibility, because I only invite the people who are likely to enjoy it, and I set the right expectations. The same goes for [wearing a suit](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a4tPMomzHhCunwqLX/you-can-just-wear-a-suit). I don't imply that anyone else should wear a suit, and the people around me don't imply that I shouldn't wear a suit. Telling other people what to do isn't socially expensive because it costs \"weirdness points\". It is socially expensive because people don't like it when you tell them to do things they don't want to do.\n\nI am weird in many different ways, but my biggest \"weirdness points\" expense is wearing ugly-yet-comfortable sandals, because it is impossible to hide the fact that I'm doing it. Friends and strangers aren't bothered by my other quirks, because I don't shove them in their face against their will. I do sometimes persuade people to my way of thinking on issues like The Current War in the Middle East. But only when they're curious.\n",

And you think to yourself…\n\n*This is exactly like what we do at my Buddhist temple.*\n\nI'm not part of a sex cult. I just noticed that **subspace**, the altered state of consciousness induced by BDSM, is very similar to **mushin**, the altered states of consciousness induced by Zen Buddhist non-dual meditation. I think the only reason they're called different words is a historical accident, because famous ascetic Buddhist monks and nuns rarely write about all the rope play they engage in while they're having kinky sex with each other.\n\nBuddhism various altered states of consciousness to explore the mind. Many of these altered states of consciousness are jhanas. A jhana is what happens when you focus your attention on a stable target for a long period of time. Jhanas feel great. Mushin is another altered state of consciousness, and is reached via a similar (but not quite the same) path. Mushin is notoriously difficult to describe declaratively. All you need to know about mushin to understand this post is that mushin is an altered state of consciousness similar to jhana. \n\nSubspace feels great too. Subspace feels so good it usually turns pain into pleasure. You know what else blurs the line between pain and pleasure? Mushin.\n\nThat's not the only similarity. Mushin and subspace are both characterized by the absence of willful volition tied to your sense of self. With Mushin, this (at first) is because you stop doing anything except breathing). In subspace, this is because you don't do anything except what your Dominant tells you to. The effect is like Tantra, except instead of moving your locus of volition into an imagined deity, you transfer it into another person.\n\nThe final clue that made me realize that subspace and mushin are independent discoveries of essentially the same altered state of consciousness has to do with the \"B\" part of BDSM: Bondage.\n\nI once gave meditation instructions to a friend. My instructions were brief, and included the line \"sit in full lotus, if you can do so safely\". Full lotus is the cross-legged sitting position where your ankles rest on top of your thighs.\n\n![](https://c1.peakpx.com/wallpaper/28/198/434/teaching-pictures-lord-budha-painting-wallpaper.jpg)\n\nMy friend was flexible enough to sit in the full lotus position, but he ignored that instruction for a long time, assuming it was mere superstition. He recently switched to mediting full lotus and reported that the full lotus position did indeed improve his meditation. The full lotus makes it easier to achieve mushin because it comfortably locks your legs in place so they can't move.\n\nYou know what else comfortably locks your limbs in place so they can't move? Rope.\n\n![](https://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/08/1424207683-fifty-shades-of-grey-rope.jpg)\n\nPlease don't start a sex cult. But if you do, I recommend you teach your disciples that BDSM is a road to achieving mushin that's like Zen Buddhism, except easier, because it requires no internal source of discipline.",
      "plaintextDescription": "Picture the following situation:\n\nYou're in bed with a hot woman. Your clothes are off and so are hers. You (consentually) tie her wrists and ankles to the bed so you can have your way with here. She tells you to do whatever you want with her. And you think to yourself…\n\nThis is exactly like what we do at my Buddhist temple.\n\nI'm not part of a sex cult. I just noticed that subspace, the altered state of consciousness induced by BDSM, is very similar to mushin, the altered states of consciousness induced by Zen Buddhist non-dual meditation. I think the only reason they're called different words is a historical accident, because famous ascetic Buddhist monks and nuns rarely write about all the rope play they engage in while they're having kinky sex with each other.\n\nBuddhism various altered states of consciousness to explore the mind. Many of these altered states of consciousness are jhanas. A jhana is what happens when you focus your attention on a stable target for a long period of time. Jhanas feel great. Mushin is another altered state of consciousness, and is reached via a similar (but not quite the same) path. Mushin is notoriously difficult to describe declaratively. All you need to know about mushin to understand this post is that mushin is an altered state of consciousness similar to jhana. \n\nSubspace feels great too.

      "markdown": "Trade surpluses are weird. I noticed this when I originally learned about them. Then I forgot this anomaly until…sigh…Eliezer Yudkowsky pointed it out.\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/20860435afed8e736fda312163996f02f02ea3ce2c37d369.png)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/7c03998de0b542118392e31b39993a121fa600f09e6e6676.png)\n\nEliezer is, as usual, correct. In this post, I will spend 800+ words explaining what he did in [44](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1893814047193059447).\n\nA trade surplus is what happens when a country exports more than it imports. For example, China imports more from Australia than Australia imports from China. Australia therefore has a **trade surplus** with China. Equivalently, China has a **trade deficit** with Australia.\n\nIn our modern era, every country wants trade surpluses and wants to avoid trade deficits. To recklessly oversimplify, having trade surplusses means you're winning at global trade, and having trade deficits means you're losing. This must be be looked at in context, however. For example, China imports raw materials from Australia which it turns into manufactured products and then sells to other countries. Because of this, China's trade deficit with Australia is part of a system that produces a net trade surplus for China, after factoring in its other trade relations.\n\nWhat's weird about this? In our modern era, every rich country in the world got that way by (basically) making things of value and sending them to strangers far away. How weird is that‽ To recklessly simplify once again: Before the current liberal international order of global trade relations, the way nations got rich was by sending armies abroad and forcing strangers to send their valuable things as tribute and taxes. That's a so much more obvious method of getting rich. Now we've got reverse empire where the most powerful nations try to subsidize their own exports. They spend money to make it cheaper to create things of value and send these things to their competitors. This isn't even altruism at work. It's the competitive equilibrium created by cutthroat competition.\n\n> In communist China, Beijing forced you to sell your grain to Beijing at below market price. The result was mass starvation across China.\n> \n> In neoliberal America, Washington DC incentivises you to sell your grain to Beijing at below market price. The result is an obesity epidemic in the USA.\n\nWhat is going on here? Isn't it better to charge higher prices for your products? Don't you want other people to send you their valuable things? Relative to market equilibrium, a subsidy is (at net) basically just giving away value for free. And when a government subsidizes exports, that extra value goes to strangers outside of its borders.\n\nThere are many roads to wealth, but the most powerful one tends to be owning the means of production. From the perspective of a country, then means having sovereignty over the means of production. In the past, when production was mostly agriculture, \"having sovereignty over the means of production\" meant conquering the most arable land. During the industrial revolution, manufacturing grew to eclipse agriculture. Production was no longer distributed according to geography. A factory complex can be built anywhere. More importantly, a factory only needs to be built in one place, once. After that, you build more factories next to existing factories, because that's where the workers, suppliers, purchasers, and so on are. That makes factories different from farms. Farms must be built everywhere, to cover all arable land. Factories are built in a small number of relatively tiny industrial centers.\n\nMy model of what happened is that centers of economic production tend to have powerful network effects. A few cities dominate the entire world. What city is the biggest manufacturer in the world? Shanghai, followed by several other Chinese cities.\n\nThis dynamic isn't unique to factories. It's true of other industries too, like entertainment. The USA dominates cinema. Only a few other countries are even in the running. Japan dominates animation. Software is so concentrated that a single city, San Francisco, dominates the world. It doesn't matter how many copies of Windows Microsoft gave away for free. All that mattered was that Windows became the standard while Microsoft remained solvent. Similarly, the bulk of a rich country's wealth comes from having sovereignty over one or more centers of global economic production.\n\nAs technology advances, extreme power tends to get concentrated in smaller number of winners. However, the various different things you can be a \"winner\" at gets more varied. There wasn't a big market for catalytic converters back in 1715 AD.\n\nMy model of trade surpluses is that value is fungible, and that the bulk of value production has strong network effects. Nations get rich by owning a global center of economic production. Sometimes countries manage to create one of these centers directly, but the incentives are so warped that government intervention is usually counterproductive. (For example, the Indian government crippled its computer software industry because they were trying to create a domestic computer hardware industry, which they also failed at.) Exports, however, are difficult for governments to fake. If a country has an export surplus, then it's probably a center of global production. This correlation is strong enough that it makes for a robust optimization target. That's why, in practice, a government policy \"subsidize exporters\" rewards the people creating value better than \"subsidize production\" does.\n\n…which is a longwinded way of saying what Eliezer said in his original tweet.",

Do not dishonor Leto with your passing.\" Jessica whirled and strode from the room with a swish of her skirt. The door closed with a satisfying thunk, leaving the boy alone with the crone.\n\nEach waited for the other to speak. It was a power game older than human beings, older than primates.\n\n\"Now that we are alone, shall we drop our masks?\" asked Paul.\n\nInstead of speaking, the Reverend Mother reached into the folds of her gown and extracted a tarnished copper cube 16 centimeters in diameter. One side appeared to be missing. Inside was just black, as if a square portal had been cut into a parallel plane of infinite emptiness.\n\n\"Put your right hand into the box,\" the Reverend Mother said.\n\nPaul willingly chose to place his hand into the box. Of course, the Reverend Mother knew he would do that. So was it really a choice? Paul felt a soft caress close around his hand, then a light prickling sensation. Finally nothing, as if his hand had been cleanly amputated.\n\nThe woman smiled cruelly. She raised her right hand to his neck. Paul instinctually flinched away.\n\n\"**Stop**,\" the woman commanded, using the Voice. It trumped Paul's reflex. Then he felt the tip of a needle painfully prick his skin. Paul was glad his combat trainer Gurney Halleck wasn't here to see this. Nevermind that Paul's mother has set him up.\n\nPaul smiled. \"Now are the conditions adequate for us to finally be honest with one another?\" Paul's other mentor, Thufir Hawat, always told Paul that the best way to persuade a person to truth was to stick out your throat. Hawat had been speaking metaphorically, but nevermind that.\n\n\"Do not worry,\" said the Reverend Mother, \"We of the Bene Gesserit never kill anyone of value.\"\n\n\"Do I have value?\" asked Paul. He knew the answer. He was just dancing with words. They both knew that.\n\n\"We shall find out,\" said the Reverend Mother, \"Now, be silent.\"\n\nIf this were one of Hawat's games, then Paul knew that the proper answer would be say something—anything. After all, a Rationalist should never be silent just because he was told to be. But today was not a Rationalist game, it was a Bene Gesserit exam. Still, the unconscious habit to protest was there. Paul stuffed it down.\n\n\"Good,\" said the Reverend Mother, \"You pass the first test. You knew that, since you're still alive. Forgive me for offending your intelligence. Now, I'm going to explain the rest of this exam: If you withdraw your hand from the box, you die. I explain this, because this is not a test of intelligence.\"\n\n\"If you kill me, our guards discover my corpse and you die,\" said Paul.\n\n\"You know nothing, spoiled child,\" said the Reverend Mother, \"If you die, your mother declares that she is guilty of your murder. I tell you this safely because if you live, then we will be allies, whereas if you die, then I need not fear your testimony.\"\n\n\"Why are you doing this to me? To her?\" asked Paul.\n\n\"Because your mother broke the rules.\"\n\n\"This is a punishment?\" said Paul.\n\n\"A consequence,\" said the Reverend Mother, \"We have no disciplinary, retaliatory or retributive motivation.\"\n\n\"Then why?\" asked Paul.\n\n\"I will waste no more time explaining things to a boy who is about to die,\" said the Reverend Mother. Then she corrected herself, \"Probably about to die, I mean.\"\n\n\"Quit wasting both of our time,\" said Paul, \"Let's get this over with, you old hag.\"\n\nThen there was pain. At first it was slight, lie a pinch. Then the feeling of a limb falling asleep. Then the pricks and slashes of knives. Finally, his hand began to burn.\n\nAt first Paul resisted. He tried to distract himself. When that wasn't enough he reminded himself that he would die if he removed his hand. When that wasn't enough he reminded himself that his mother would die if he removed his hand. When that wasn't enough he tried one of the secret techniques his mother had told him about. He tried to mentally throw himself away.\n\nThat didn't work either.\n\nSo Paul did the last thing he wanted to do. He focused his attention on his burning hand. He felt every sensation as carefully as he could. And when Paul did, he realized the cybernetic interface was nothing more complicated than a sinusoidal wave generator. That's all he felt: a sinusoidal wave emmanating from the nerve inputs to his hand. It still took tremendous effort to keep his hand in the box, but with just the right attentional focus, Paul bypassed the encapsulation layer of pain.\n\nThat almost didn't work either.\n\nThen the pain was gone, as was the syringe at Paul's neck.\n\n\"My turn,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Hahahaaa,\" the Reverend Mother laughed, \"I have already been through the gom jabbar, as have all Bene Gesserit.\"\n\n*Including my mother,* Paul thought, \"Now what?\"\n\n\"Jessica come in,\" called the Reverend Mother.\n\nThe door slammed open, and Paul was in his mother's arms, wet with her fresh tears and his own cold ones.\n\n\"Now what?\" Paul said again.\n\n\"In our incompetent civilization,\" said the Reverend Mother, \"Prophets happen by accident. It is time to change that.\"\n",

It does.\n\nWhile this may be true, I think the reverse is more important. Altruistic behavior increases compassion. More generally, acting non-compassionately is an obstacle to insight. In this way, mystic practice is intimately intertwined with morality.\n\n> Compassion increases joy and happiness too.\n\nDirectionally true, with a qualifier. There are many mental states that feel better than joy and happiness. \"Compassion makes you feel better\" is true, but feeling better may not precisely coincide with joy and happiness. Is absolute zero \"ice cold\"?\n\n> [T]hey can investigate whether meditation produces longterm increases in compassion.\n\nYes. Longterm meditation increases compassion, with the qualifier that the meditation must be done correctly.\n\n> One form of lovingkindness meditation starts by cultivating compassion for the people close to you and then gradually widening the ingroup until it includes everyone―including your enemies. Does this practice help reduce hatred?\n\nIt's not just lovingkindness meditation that reduces hatred. Non-dual meditation does too, because hatred is predicated on a self-other separation.\n\n> > [T]hree of the most \"advanced\" monks…[brains'] responded as strongly to the twentieth sound as to the first. This was big news: ordinarily the brain would tune out, showing no reaction to the tenth bing, let alone the twentieth.\n>\n> This constitutes objective external verification of my own and others' subjective experiences in zendo. It makes total sense if you are familiar with Zen and it is strong evidence that meditation may be a path off of the hedonic treadmill.\n>\n> ⋮\n>\n> Zen's priority is on mindful attention (as opposed to, say, lovingkindness) so we would expect one of the strongest effects within this tradition but increased attention is found in other traditions too.\n\nNothing to add here.\n\n> [M]editators who have done a three-year retreat in the Tibetan tradition had less habituation of eye blinks when they heard loud bursts of noise.\n\nI have had a related experience this last year, which is that large noises that used to startle me often don't anymore. Instead of resisting them, I just let them dissipate. This happens at the reflexive level, faster than my conscious decisionmaking.\n\n> [R]esearchers gave volunteers a two-week course in mindfulness…for a total of six hours, plus ten-minute booster sessions at home daily. The active control group studied nutrition for the same amount of time. Again, mindfulness improved concentration and lessened mind-wandering.\n>\n> A surprise: mindfulness also improved working memory―the holding in mind of information so it can transfer into long-term memory.\n\nIs there an effect here? Maybe for some people. For me, at least, the positive effect to working memory isn't super cumulative nor important. Does a little meditation before work help me concentrate? Sure, but so does weightlifting, taking a shower, and going for a walk.\n\nMeanwhile, the effect of deep meditative insight on long-term memory seems to be negative. This isn't because I can't memorize things anymore—I'm just less interested in doing so. I'm not the only person to report this.\n\n> According to Buddhist lore, suffering is caused by unsatisfactoriness, non-self and impermanence. These are three kinds of attachment. Freedom from suffering comes from releasing attachment to the self, attachment to the state of the world and attachment to one's desires. Releasing attachment to one releases attachment to all. Freedom from suffering comes from letting go.\n\nNot only is this true, you can observe it for yourself by doing meditation.\n\n> Another experience meditators consistently report is the deconstruction of sensory inputs into vibrations.\n>\n> ⋮\n>\n> Meditators learn to deconstruct their high-level cognitive constructs into low-level sensory inputs….  Pain and suffering are above the lowest level of abstraction. Thus, perceptually deconstructing one's ontologies lets a person transcend pain….\n\nThis is true. It's why protesting monks can sit calmly while burning alive. I've never gone that far, but I have dissolved less intense painful stimulus into vibrations. Please don't test this by hurting me.\n\n> This creates a physical measure connected to self-reports of \"ego death\".\n\nEgo death is a real thing.\n\n> Does all this \"renouncing attachment\" mean meditators live cold hollow indifferent existences? No. Definitely not. Meditators consistently report the opposite. There are dangers to watch out for (and I will address them at the end) but disconnecting yourself from pleasure is not one of them.\n\nIt is true that meditators don't live cold, hollow, indifferent existences. It is also true that there are dangers to watch out for. Also, I think pleasure may get dissolved the way pain does, depending on your definition of \"pleasure\".\n\nMore generally, I feel that the books on meditation I read weren't quite comprehensive in bluntly stating quite how much of myself I'd ultimately sacrifice going down this road. That said, it was worth it—there's no doubt about that.\n\n> For me, personally, I think the biggest danger isn't wireheading myself (which is a bigger danger to practitioners of samadhi) or getting trapped in a vortex of despair (which might happen if your ego refuses to let go of suffering). It's going crazy. The meditation I practice feels like staring into the maw of Cthulhu.\n\nYup lol. I never came close to wireheading myself (since I do comparatively little samadhi) and I got through my first (and worst) Dark Night in [three days](https://www.lsusr.com/blog/dark-night.html). As for getting too much insight too fast and frying myself…see my previous post on [Awakening](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/99PwFdz7qwHxQgwYx/awakening).\n",

Good luck guessing that meaning from the names \"cost disease\" and \"Baumol effect\".\n\nAnother economic term that you can't guess the meaning of and must instead memorize the definition of is **moral hazard**. \"Moral hazard\" is a fancy academic way of describing \"a situation that incentivises rational selfishness at the expense of other people\". Rational selfishness is a good default assumption of how large masses of people will behave.\n\n- If the price of a good decreases, then people will buy more of it.\n- If the price of a good increases, then people will buy less of it.\n- If the price a good sells for decreases, then businesses will produce less of it.\n- If the price a good sells for increases, then businesses will produce more of it.\n\nThis is all Economics 101. Most people—and therefore most voters—do not know Economics 101. The typical left-wing voter doesn't consider that taxing billionaires has negative second-order effects on incentive structures. The typical person barely considers incentive structures at all, even in the domain of violent crime—nevermind economics.\n\nThe vast majority of voters are economically illiterate. Collectively, voters tend to advocate for economically backwards policies, such as free parking. Voters love government handouts of essential goods, and oppose policies that make the ultra-rich get even richer. Because of this mass ignorance, it is often possible to predict where public sentiment deviates from economically sound policy. In other words, voters advocate for harmful policies, and do so predictably.\n\nYou might think that the solution is \"The government should educate the public on economics.\" But think about what happens when a democracy[^1] attempts this. Public school is a arm of government. When public schools touch upon a political topic, they teach a compromise [moderate](https://paulgraham.com/mod.html?hmsr=joyk.com) position somewhere amidst the reigning ideologies. And why do the current reigning ideologies reign? Because economically illiterate voters like them. Mass education is how you cement your ideological victory, not how you replace demagoguery with truth—except by accident. In my high school history class, I was taught about the benefits of consumer protection regulations. The negative second-order economic effects were never even mentioned. This is leftist indoctrination at its finest.\n\n[^1]: Autocracies suffer from the same problem, except the link from public sentiment to public policy is more opaque.\n\nIt's easy to attribute this whole problem to human stupidity. And human stupidity is certainly a factor. But socialist leaders tend to be very smart people. Communist dictators aren't idiots; it took Joseph Stalin an unusual level of intelligence to take over Russia. For this reason, I find it more productive to understand this Voters Advocate Economically Harmful Policies problem  as an effect of moral hazard, rather than mere stupidity.\n\n# Tragedy of the Commons\n\nA **tragedy of the commons** is what happens when lots of people can benefit personally by sacrificing a collective good. For example, consider oceanic fish[^2]. If we don't fish at all, then we don't get any fish. But if we fish too much, then fish populations collapse, and we get only a little fish, which is bad too. There is an optimal amount of fish that humanity should harvest from the oceans. If we harvest more than that, then there is less fish to go around, and humanity ends up at a net loss.\n\n[^2]: For this example, I'm assuming that fish are non-sentient and that harvesting more fish is creating more value for humanity.\n\nBut that only works on a collective level. If you're an individual fishing company, and you fish more than your fair share, then the benefits of your extra fishing go to you whereas the harms are distributed mostly to other people. The rational selfish strategy is to fish as much as you can. If you don't fish as much as you can, then a competing company that does will outcompete you. The global result is a coordination failure, which is why global oceanic fish reserves are in a bad state right now.\n\nDemocratic voting is a tragedy of the commons.\n\nEveryone benefits from good governance. If you want to vote well, then you need to understand why some policies are good and other policies are bad. If you want to understand why certain policies are good and bad, then you need to learn things like Economics 101, which most people find boring. Voting well is difficult. But if you, personally, put in lots of time and effort into voting well, then [you will not personally benefit](https://www.lsusr.com/blog/moral-hazard.html) much from your vote because even if it does affect the government, the benefits are distributed across such a large population that your personal benefit will be negligible.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium is mass ignorance, virtue signalling, and a veneer of intellectual legitimacy. This problem isn't limited to voting. It applies to everything from protesting to Reddit comments. Everywhere that individual people aren't held individually accountable for their declared policy preferences *i.e.* everywhere except prediction markets, regular markets and…um…places you have a personal reputation to protect *e.g.* writing longform content under an established pseudonym here on Less Wrong.\n",

      "markdown": "*This is Part 4 of a Star Wars fanfiction I began writing 6 months ago. The order you read it in is very important. Start from [the beginning](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7bCncTCwKHeowtwMR/p/xcJj2zjyDDjgtZy2y) for the best experience and to avoid spoilers.*\n\n---\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi bought passage from a scumbag with a confusing name. Luke couldn't discern whether Han's name was pronounced /hɑːn/ or /hæn/? Fortunately this story is in prose, not film, and the pronunciation of Han's name is not plot relevant, so I can just write \"Han\" and leave the choice of pronunciation up to you. Whatever pronunciation you pick, they emerged from hyperspace in the Alderaan system. Han briefed his passengers for their upcoming landing.\n\n\"Thank you for flying with us. We have received clearance to land and have begun our descent onto Alderaan. Please do not leave any contraband on this ship. Unless it's valuable. Then by all means leave it here, but let me know where it is,\" said Han.\n\n\"Grawr,\" said Chewbacca.\n\n\"You're right,\" Luke sighed, \"I guess deep down I wish I lived in an exciting isekai universe full epic destinies, sci-fi technology, and princesses in need of rescue. Instead, here I am in the real world, 19-year-old Luke Skywalker, riding a YT-1300 Corellian light freighter to Alderaan.\"\n\n\"Grawr,\" said Chewbacca.\n\n\"You know,\" said Han, \"I always assumed Alderaan was a temperate planet. I didn't realize it was a megastructure like Centerpoint Station.\"\n\nThat got their attention. \"Alderaan is a temperate planet,\" said Obi-Wan.\n\nThe word \"Alderaan\" can refer to the star \"Alderaan\", the planet \"Alderaan\", and the star system \"Alderaan\". If you want to be pedantic, the planet Alderaan ought to be referred to as \"Alderaan I\". (In this way, Earth can be referred to as \"Sol III\".) But everyone just called it \"Alderaan\".\n\nWhen Chewbacca entered \"Alderaan I\" into the navcomputer, that told the navcomputer to bring the *Falcon* to the first planet in the \"Alderaan\" system. A planet is a massive spherical object that has cleared its orbit of competing debris. The navcomputer defines to \"Alderaan I\" as the big massive object orbiting Alderaan.\n\nThus, the *Milennium Falcon* emerged from hyperspace not around Leia's home planet of Alderaan I (which no longer existed) but instead within kilometers of the Life Star.\n\nOur four heroes looked at the Life Star through the cockpit window.\n\n\"You're telling me this isn't Alderaan?\" said Han.\n\n\"Nope,\" said Obi-Wan, \"Didn't you think to ask why we were landing on a giant Imperial battlestation?\"\n\n\"'No questions asked'―that was the deal. Well, that's your problem. We're already in the process of landing. It's been wonderful meeting you all,\" said Han.\n\n\"That's a lot of turbolaser turrets,\" said Obi-Wan, \"This megastructure is armed like an Imperial battlestation. I wonder what the Empire might do if they come to believe that this ship has been used less than legally, in any way. I mean, it doesn't make a difference to me―I'm just a passenger. But *Captain* Han Solo might get in trouble if the ownership trail of this transport ship isn't perfectly documented and taxed. Not to imply anything, of course. You did assure us you are a legitimate businessman. Especially when we ran the Imperial Navy's blockade of Mos Eisley, which I'm sure the Imperial Navy knows nothing about.\"\n\n\"Chewie, turn us around,\" said Han.\n\n\"But we can't turn back, fear is their greatest defense, I doubt if the actual security there is any greater than it was on Aquilae or Sullust and what there is is most likely directed towards a large-scale assault,\" said Luke.\n\n\"Are you always like this?\" said Han, exasperated.\n\n\"I'm sure we'll be fine,\" said Luke, \"Obi-Wan Kenobi is a space wizard. Grand strategy is predicated on the laws of physics. If you have magic powers, then you can use them to flip the gameboard. All of their strategies go out the window. It's hard even to imagine a magic power that isn't totally busted when put into intelligent hands.\"\n\n\"Hyperspace. Now,\" said Han.\n\nChewbacca pulled the lever activating the hyperdrive. There was a [clunk] sound, but the stars remained fixed in place.\n\n\"It's too late. We're caught by their tractor beam,\" said Luke.\n\n\"I hadn't noticed,\" said Han, grumpily.\n\n\"Okay. We're landing on that fortress-like thing whether we want to or not, and we're in a ship that just ran the Imperial Blockade on Mos Eisley,\" said Luke, \"Who has a plan that might get some of us out of here alive?\"\n\n---\n\n\"Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?\" asked Princess Leia Organa.\n\nI'm not going to bother describing this scene. Most of you reading this have probably watched *Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope*. You know what Death Star detention block AA-23 looks like. In case you haven't, [here's the original scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OysLc4yTZLs). Now back to the story.\n\nThe not-a-stormtrooper took off his helmet.\n\n\"Huh? Oh, the uniform,\" Luke Skywalker took off the stormtrooper helmet, \"I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.\"\n\n\"You're who?\" asked Leia.\n\n\"I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. He's the last space wizard. This battlestation is nothing next to the power of space magic. Right now this entire battlestation is hunting him, which is how I got into your detention block so easily,\" said Luke.\n\n\"Darth Vader is here,\" said Leia.\n\n\"So?\" said Luke.\n\n\"Um…. Do you know why Obi-Wan Kenobi is the last space wizard?\" asked Leia.\n\n\"Why? Does that matter?\" said Luke.\n\n\"Because Darth Vader killed the rest,\" said Leia.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Luke.\n\n---\n\nKenobi and Vader faced each other with lightsaber blades humming.\n\n\"Full disclosure,\" said Obi-Wan, \"If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. Specifically, I will cast Force Transcendence and become one with the Force. Alas, it only works if I die involuntarily. Therefore it against your interests to kill me.\"\n\n\"If this were true, then you would not tell me,\" said Vader, \"You know that my lightsaber consumes all the space magic in its vicinity. You know that my anti-magic field renders your Force Transcendence power inoperable. You are bluffing.\"\n\nObi-Wan charged at Vader. Vader struck him down.\n\n---\n\n\"If Obi-Wan fails to disable the tractor beam preventing our escape, then what do we do instead?\" asked Luke.\n\n\"We steal Vader's flagship,\" said Leia.\n\n\"Are you insane?\" said Luke.\n\n\"No. Insane is getting trapped in an Imperial megastructure and then deciding to yourself 'I'm going to rescue the princess',\" said Leia.\n\n\"How would that help, anyway?\" asked Luke.\n\n\"Vader's flagship has special technology,\" said Leia, \"It disabled my corvette's hyperdrive and artificial gravity. I wouldn't be surprised if it could disable a tractor beam too.\"\n\n\"But how will we get there?\" said Luke.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Leia sarcastically, \"If only we had a complete schematic of this megastructure and a droid with all sensitive information related to its firmware. We could get there through the maintenance tunnels. This battlestation is nothing next to the power of espionage.\"\n\n\"Beep beep,\" R2 chirped over the radio.\n\nLuke Skywalker and his sister took a dirty shortcut where they were attacked by a slimy tentacle monster. They kissed each other. Somehow this story managed to stay PG.\n\n---\n\nLuke, Leia, Han, the Wookie and their droids emerged in Thrawn's hanger containing Vader's Interdictor Ship.\n\n\"Where are the guards?\" asked Luke.\n\n\"I told Thrawn's troops that Vader wanted his ship back and that he was in a bad mood,\" said Han.\n\n\"I can't believe they fell for that,\" said Leia, \"By which I mean that I literally don't believe it. But I don't even care anymore at this point. I'm done pretending that reality makes sense. I will deal with reality again when we are off this clown show of a megastructure. Activate the Interdictor Field and let's get out of here.\"\n\n\"Um…\" said Han.\n\n\"What?\" said Leia.\n\n\"I can't find the controls for the Interdictor Field generator,\" said Han.\n\n\"Grawr,\" said Chewbacca.\n\n\"Chewie can't find them either,\" said Han, \"Our repulsors aren't strong enough to break free of the tractor beam holding us in place. And if I run the chemical rockets we'll just explode instead, unless we can get that tractor beam shut off first.\"\n\nStormtroopers appeared in the human entrance to the hanger. They opened fire at Vader's Interdictor Ship.\n\n\"Let me guess,\" said Luke, \"The troops don't care about Han and Chewbacca, but they care about Leia and R2, so they pretended to be tricked by Han as a gambit by which they trapped all of us here.\"\n\nLeia nodded. \"We'd better find that Interdictor Field generator fast. Unless they knew about the Interdictor Field generator and removed it, as part of the trap.\"\n\n\"We've searched this entire ship,\" said Han, \"There's lots of weird stuff about it. Exotic weapons, a set of chemical reaction engines. A concealed hyperspace beacon (which we immediately destroyed). But no Interdictor Field. It doesn't even have an artificial gravity generator.\"\n\nArtifical gravity generator. That reminded Luke of an irregularity he had filed away long ago. That all of physics was perfectly beautiful and symmetric except for hyperspace, artificial gravity, shields and a few weapon types. Luke put together a puzzle that had been staring him in the face all his life. He was going to flip the gameboard.\n\n\"Zark you, Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" Luke muttered.\n\n\"What?\" said Leia.\n\n\"Every in your seats. Now! Buckle up!\" Luke shouted, \"Han, prepare to activate the chemical thrusters.\"\n\n\"But if I activate the chemical rockets while the tractor beam is active, then we'll all die in a fiery explosion,\" said Han.\n\nBkzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\n\nLuke ignited the lightsaber Obi-Wan stole from Vader. The Life Star's local artificial gravity vanished and they were left with only a slight natural gravity. The troopers stopped firing. All the air in the docking bay rushed out as the force field containing it vanished.\n\n\"Are you insane‽\" said Leia, \"Turn that thing off. You could cut someone's arm off.\"\n\n\"Trust me on this,\" said Luke, \"Han, activate the chemical thrusters.\"\n\nHan pulled a lever and they were thrown back into their seats at several $g$s. The Interdictor Ship rocketed out of the hanger.\n",

Start from the beginning for the best experience and to avoid spoilers.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi bought passage from a scumbag with a confusing name. Luke couldn't discern whether Han's name was pronounced /hɑːn/ or /hæn/? Fortunately this story is in prose, not film, and the pronunciation of Han's name is not plot relevant, so I can just write \"Han\" and leave the choice of pronunciation up to you. Whatever pronunciation you pick, they emerged from hyperspace in the Alderaan system. Han briefed his passengers for their upcoming landing.\n\n\"Thank you for flying with us. We have received clearance to land and have begun our descent onto Alderaan. Please do not leave any contraband on this ship. Unless it's valuable. Then by all means leave it here, but let me know where it is,\" said Han.\n\n\"Grawr,\" said Chewbacca.\n\n\"You're right,\" Luke sighed, \"I guess deep down I wish I lived in an exciting isekai universe full epic destinies, sci-fi technology, and princesses in need of rescue. Instead, here I am in the real world, 19-year-old Luke Skywalker, riding a YT-1300 Corellian light freighter to Alderaan.\"\n\n\"Grawr,\" said Chewbacca.\n\n\"You know,\" said Han, \"I always assumed Alderaan was a temperate planet. I didn't realize it was a megastructure like Centerpoint Station.\"\n\nThat got their attention. \"Alderaan is a temperate planet,\" said Obi-Wan.\n\nThe word \"Alderaan\" can refer to the star \"Alderaan\", the planet \"Alderaan\", and the star system \"Alderaan\". If you want to be pedantic, the planet Alderaan ought to be referred to as \"Alderaan I\". (In this way, Earth can be referred to as \"Sol III\".)

      "markdown": "\"I read [*Friendly And Hostile Analogies For Taste*](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/friendly-and-hostile-analogies-for) by Scott Alexander and I'm confused,\" said Elsani.\n\n\"Why are you reading a blog post that's over 100 years old?\" asked her friend Taze, \"Society has made so much progress since then.\"\n\n\"Has it?\" asked Elsani, \"A random walk, in retrospect, looks like like directional movement of distance $\\sqrt n$. If you assume your normative values to be true, then history always looks like progress. That's how fashion changes constantly without going anywhere. This is a point Alexander makes in his blog post.\"\n\n\"Did Alexander really write '$\\sqrt n$'? My understanding was that 21st-century psychiatrists didn't speak Baseline nor thought that precisely,\" said Taze.\n\n\"Now that you mention it, the '$\\sqrt n$' might have been a grammatically-mandatory artifact inserted by the translation software I used,\" said Elsani, \"But the point stands. Scott Alexander was a founding thought leader behind the Lightcone salon. They were speaking proto-Baseline before Baseline even existed.\"\n\n\"I understand the historical importance of Scott Alexander. But why bother with the classics? Modern pedogogical techniques are so much more efficient,\" said Taze.\n\n\"For trivially-verifiable objective truth, sure,\" said Elsani, \"But for questions of value? You must treat contemporaneous society as a hostile optimizer. Doubly so for its pedagogical techniques.\"\n\n\"I think you need to talk to a Keeper,\" said Taze.\n\nElsani hadn't considered that. She associated Keepers with questions of strategy, fact and probability. To consult a de'a'na est shadarak about a question of value—about a question of *opinion* <shudder>—had never occurred to her. But it was the obvious decision in retrospect.\n\n---\n\nThe Temple of Truth was a gigantic compound. At its center was a grand circular nave underneath a hemispherical dome. The walls were steel and the dome was carbon fiber, to create the grandest possible structure. In the center of the dome was a circular oculus. The whole thing symbolized an eye staring up at the heavens. When you stood before the oculus and looked straight up, you were that eye.\n\nElsani closed her eyes and pictured the legend.\n\n> \"What do you know with absolute certainty?\" asked the first Keeper.\n>\n> \"The sky is blue,\" said the first acolyte.\n>\n> \"Go outside. Look straight up. Tell me what you observe,\" said the first Keeper.\n>\n> The acolyte stepped outside, and stared up a nighttime sky so light-polluted she couldn't name a single constellation. Rain fell on her face.\n>\n> \"It's black right now,\" said the first de'a'na est shadarak.\n\nElsani wasn't so childish as to believe that anybody could ever have believed something so obviously false as \"the sky is blue\" when you could look out a window and see otherwise. She understood that the story was an exaggeration. Archetypical truth, not literal truth.\n\n\"What do you know with absolute certainty?\" asked the Triager.\n\nElsani walked slightly north of the center nave and stood under the noonday sun. She felt like a vampire getting executed. You were supposed to look upward though the oculus and state what color you observed. But Elsani wasn't here to ask a question of trivially-verifiable objective fact. She was here to understand taste. She closed her eyes and inclined her head down.\n\n*And under the light of the Sun, I shall slay giants,* Elsani whispered to herself. She opened her eyes. Aloud, she said, \"These are beautiful floor tiles. I know this structure is supposed to symbolize an eye, but for that to work it would have to be spherical or hemispherical. By placing the hemisphere on top of cylindrical walls, it looks more like a penis to me, and a short one at that. It's even got a hole at the tip, something that eyes, technically-speaking, do not.\"\n\nWas that a slight smile on the corners of the Triager's mouth? The Triager retrieved a gold-embossed sheet of cellulose from his habit and marked it with scarlet ink.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Elsani.\n\n---\n\nElsani took an electric taxi through the underground tunnels toward the destination the Triager had marked. She emerged in the Art Sector.\n\nElsani didn't know exactly where the Art Sector was, which was normal. She just got into a taxi, told it \"Art Sector\", and a few underground minutes later she was in the Art Sector.\n\nThe Great City was built on a modular grid system designed to transcend geography. Buildings were, by default (excepting large infrastructure, like the Truth Temple complex), portable. A cable system spanning the entire city moved them around, so that it was always convenient to live near your friends.\n\nThe Art Sector was decorated as if its residents were at war against rectangles. The major collectives bought warehouse-sized portables, and then build small villages inside of them. Smaller collectives cut holes between their adjacent portables and fused them together (thereby rendering them non-portable). Some of the building transport cables had even been cut.\n\nIn short, the Art Sector was uncivilized.\n\nElsani noticed a middle-aged man walking around naked except for shiny tassels on his shoulders and thighs. She waved to him.\n\n\"Are you here for the Tentacle Monster Festival?\" the man asked.\n\n\"Nothing so prosaic,\" said Elsani. She checked her cellulose, \"Can you tell me where to find Arcadia of the Black Rose?\"\n\n\"Ah, you're here on shadarak business,\" said the man, \"Walk along the *allée* towards that kaiju sculpture made out of spray paint cans. Turn left beneath the white archway. Follow the *rue étroite* until you encounter the digital used bookstore. Just beyond it is an alleyway. Turn right into that alleyway. Continue until you encounter a door with a black rose on it.\"\n\nElsani asked him to repeat the instructions a couple times until she was sure she could remember them.\n\n\"Do you know what Arcadia might appreciate as dana?\" asked Elsani.\n\n\"In the alleyway with the digital used bookstore is an art supply shop called Kamikami. Arcadia is a regular there. Ask the owner what she's running low on.\"\n\nElsani thanked the man and followed his instructions to the art supply shop. A boy was leaving the shop just as Elsani tried to enter and they almost bumped into each other. The boy quickly scurried away with an apology.\n\nThere was nobody at the counter. Elsani shouted a few times to no avail. In place of a cash register, there was just a box with a slit for cash, next to an ATM. She would have to guess what Arcadia might appreciate.\n\nWhat did Elsani know about Arcadia? Just that Arcadia was a locally-respected Keeper living in the Art Sector, and a member of a collective called the Black Rose.\n\nWhat are all artists constantly running out of? Quality snacks. Elsani left Kamikami emptyhanded and went to the nearby bakery to buy a fresh *pain au chocolat* as dana for the shadarak, instead.\n\n\"Did you move here recently,\" asked the girl at the bakery counter.\n\n\"No,\" said Elsani, \"I'm just looking for Arcadia.\"\n\nThere was a *snerrk* sound from a little table by the window.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" said Elsani, affronted. She put her hands on her hips.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the boy at the table who had recently bumped into Elsani coming out of Kamikami.\n\n\"It's clearly something,\" said Elsani. She sat down opposite the boy, not bothering to ask permission. She looked at his notebook, \"That's really pretty. What are you drawing?\"\n\nThe boy was sketching a bright red 4-wheeled vehicle with a grill on the front as if it breathed air. Between that and its red curves, the vehicle looked almost alive.\n\n\"This is called a Ferrari,\" said the boy, \"It's from an old story titled [*Samsara*](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/04/samsara/).\"\n\n\"You're into Scott Alexander too?\" said Elsani, \"I didn't know anyone else was into early 21st Century literature these days. So that's what he was writing about in the story. I assumed it was a kind of dinosaur.\"\n\n\"What do you want with Arcadia?\" demanded the boy, \"because she won't apprentice me, no matter how many times I ask.\"\n\n\"I'm not looking for a mistress. There's an Astral Codex blog post I'm trying to understand,\" said Elsani. She showed the boy *Friendly And Hostile Analogies For Taste*, which she had downloaded a copy of onto her e-ink datapad.\n\nThe boy read the blog post, then tapped it to show the original, which he glanced at before handing Elsani's datapad back to her.\n\n\"Why did you look at the English version?\" asked Elsani, \"and what's your name?\"\n\n\"Because a lot of pre-Baseline philosophy is arguing about words,\" said the boy, \"Your translation software converts the English word '*taste*' into Baseline 'taste'. In this case, the translation is good enough, but other times it's possible to lose a cruxy ambiguity.\"\n\n\"Then what do you think?\" asked Elsani, \"Is taste objective like physics or an arbitrary accident of history like Hindu ritual? And what's your name anyway?\"\n\nThe boy smirked. \"You don't know a thing about Art, do you?\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Soren, of the Black Rose,\" said Soren, \"What should I address you as?\"\n\n\"Elsani,\" said Elsani.\n\nSoren waited for Elsani to finish. The seconds dragged on for a while. The counter girl brought each of them a glass of water.\n\n\"What makes you say I know nothing about Art?\" asked Elsani.\n\n\"What is beauty?\" said Soren.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Elsani.\n\n\"Really?\" said Soren, \"Because this Ferrari is beautiful. Well, maybe not my drawing. But the original is beautiful. Was.\"\n\n\"Your drawing is beautiful too,\" said Elsani.\n\n\"How do you know?\" asked Soren.\n\n\"It's a feeling I get when I look at it,\" said Elsani.\n\n\"Maybe that's just the conditioning talking,\" said Soren, \"You've been taught to believe that Ferraris are beautiful.\"\n\n\"That can't be true,\" said Elsani, \"Because I've never seen one before in my life. Technically I still haven't.\"\n\n\"Then beauty is something real,\" said Soren, \"It's not just an arbitrary standard like grammar.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elsani, \"Would you like this *pain au chocolat*?\"\n\n\"I couldn't take your snack,\" said Soren.\n\n\"It wasn't for me,\" said Elsani.\n\nSoren puzzled for a moment, then accepted the perishable baked good. \"Of course, people can disagree about what is beautiful.\"\n\n\"Then some of them are wrong,\" said Elsani.\n\n\"You and I enjoy *pain au chocolat*. But there are other people who don't. Surely that does not mean we are right and they are wrong,\" said Soren.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Elsani, \"They could be right and we could be wrong.\"\n\nSoren rolled his eyes, \"You know what I mean.\"\n\n\"You're saying different people have different preferences, and that beauty is a preference,\" said Elsani.\n\nSoren resumed rendering the Ferrari in his cellulose notebook.\n\n\"If you're making art for an audience, then satisfying their preferences is, to you, a externally verifiable standard,\" said Elsani.\n\n\"What about preference falsification?\" asked Soren, \"What about unconscious preference falsification?\"\n\n\"Shut your journal,\" said Elsani.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Soren.\n\n\"Just do it,\" said Elsani.\n\nSoren did.\n\nElsani threw her water in his face.\n\n\"What was that for?\" said Soren, angrily.\n\n\"I didn't want to ruin your beautiful drawing,\" said Elsani.\n\nSoren cracked a broad grin. Then he threw his glass of water in her face.\n\n\"What was that for?\" said Elsani, laughing.\n\n\"You revealed a preference for it,\" said Soren.\n\nElsani got up to leave.\n\n\"Would you like to meet Arcadia?\" said Soren, \"I think she'd like you.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the offer, but I found what I was looking for,\" said Elsani.\n",

There's nothing about how to safely navigate the territory afterward—or what to do afterward—or even what happens afterward.\"\n\n\"The first thing you need to know is that what you experienced was real,\" the Zen Master spoke from personal experience and that of his many previous students, \"Don't make it too complicated. Just be in the moment. If you're cooking, then just cook. If you're eating, then just eat.\"\n\nIt is impossible to communicate the subjective experience of Stream Entry to someone who has not personally experienced at least kensho. However, it is possible to communicate an outside mechanistic model of what happens in your brain. First I will explain how a human brain functions normally. Then I will explain how a post-Awakening brain differs.[^1]\n\n[^1]: This is my personal theory. Much of it is stolen from [the excellent work of Steven Byrnes](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GvJe6WQ3jbynyhjxm/intuitive-self-models-6-awakening-enlightenment-pnse). I hope I am stating my claims precisely enough so that when the scientific establishment catches up, it can confirm or falsify my statements.\n\nYour brain creates a real-time simulation of you and world around you. Everything you consciously perceive is part of this model. There are no exceptions. How does this produce useful behavior? Because the brain enforces a 1-to-1 correspondence between the simulation and reality (where \"reality\" is defined as sensory inputs). If this 1-to-1 correspondence is adequately maintained, then performing an act in the simulation happens simultaneously as that same action happening in external physical reality. That's why if you die in the Matrix then you die in real life too.\n\nIf a brain just modeled the environment without performing any actions, then the whole model could exist as a [non-cyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). But a brain doesn't just model the world. It sends commands to muscles that act on the physical universe it's trying to model. What happens when a brain tries to anticipate its own motor commands? Now the brain's own algorithms are a causal force in the external environment it's trying to model. The result is [computationally intractable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).\n\nIn response, the brain divides its model of the universe into \"things under its motor control\" and \"things not under its motor control\". Those parts of the universe it can control coalesce into \"self\" and the rest coalesces into \"other\".\n\nOther calculations involving self-reference become encapsulated too. This produces high-level abstractions including pain, pleasure and desire. These encapsulations feel like part of the self, because they involve self-reference, but they also feel like objective external truth, because they are not perceived as being under causal motor control.\n\nThere are many types of meditation[^2], but most of them involve sitting still and all of them involve not taking self-motivated willful action on the external physical world. In other words, meditation is when you stop doing things that cause problematic self-reference in your world model.\n\n[^2]: This includes the kind of prayer where you quietly listen to the thing called God.\n\nWhen you do this, all of those abstractions created to contain problematic self-reference become unnecessary. Desire, pain, pleasure, self and other—they all no longer serve a purpose. Stop using them long enough, and your brain takes them apart, like disassembling a Lego set.\n\nWhen you start meditating and sit in the full lotus position, your legs fall asleep and you feel a pain in them. After you've been meditating for years and sit in the full lotus position, your legs fall asleep and you feel the vibratory sensory inputs directly, without the encapsulation layer called \"pain\". The concept of \"pain\" is no longer a meaningful abstraction in your world model. Talking about pain to a yogi is like talking about \"God\" to an ex-Mormon.\n\nLots of models get dissolved. Prior to meditating, I felt like I was a small person walking around a region of Cartesian Space containing Planet Earth. Now I feel like a local region of local space is being created and destroyed around me like how the Minecraft game engine loads and unloads blocks. This happened because I got a direct enough perception of my own conscious reality that an illusion shattered and my perception shifted permanently. It was like going out-of-bounds in a videogame speedrun. You can never unsee the behind-the-curtain mechanics of how that reality is constructed.\n\nBut what really surprised me is what happened over a year later.\n\nI'm autistic. Most of my life I've had trouble understanding other people and guessing how they want me to behave. In my late teens/early 20s, I studied history, anthropology, psychology and economics. This helped a bit.\n\nThen a couple years ago I hit Stream Entry (aka Awakening) when I observed a bunch of my own mental processes that had been hidden from me. The internal workings of these parts of my mind had formerly been encapsulated away from my self-perception. But now I saw what they were doing. That reduced my subjective experience of suffering.\n\nIt also allowed me to infer these same processes in other people. Suddenly other people weren't confusing anymore! I could predict how someone's ego would react to the things I said before I said them.\n\nThis was useful because I could finally conduct probing psychological experiments on my friends. I had always wanted to know what people were thinking, but whenever I tried to ask, people would get hurt and defensive. Now I knew how to not trigger those defense mechanisms. That meant I could run a series of experiments where [I sat my good friends down and tested how their minds worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC4pypoyYxk). Not only did they not feel attacked, they usually felt that they'd been deeply heard, as if they'd been to a therapist. I could call a friend an idiot to his face and he'd shrug and go \"yeah\".\n\nThat solved one problem, but I still had [my original autistic sensory disorder](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pfoZSkZ389gnz5nZm/the-intense-world-theory-of-autism). Meditation was making it worse. Meditation makes you extra sensitive to sensory stimuli. Autism (I think) is caused by your sensory inputs having too much gain, in the audio signal-processing sense of the word \"gain\".\n\nThis continued for months. I bought the most comfortable clothes I could find. I installed blackout blinds over my windows. I bought a pair of Bose noise-cancelling headphones and wore them everywhere. I wore them so much I wore them out and bought a second pair. I wore earplugs to ballroom salsa dance.\n\nThen the wave crested. A friend invited me to his birthday party with loud music where we played my first game of beer pong. I had to take a breather outside once or twice from the noise and chaos. But I felt…normal…for the first time in my life. I knew what the social expectations were and I followed them. This was different from my previous attempts to behave like a normal human being because I wasn't doing it on a cognitive level. It was just intuitive. My autistic sensory disorder was no longer overwhelming my social intuition instincts.\n\nSince then, my sensory issues have gone into in freefall. I think I've had a successful round of meditation-instigated neural annealing. I went to a bar for New Year and didn't have any sensory issues at all. You know that stuff Dale Carnegie teaches about listening to people? It's easy after ego-death. I was told I had good vibes. Someone tried to buy me a beer. I lost track of how many people hugged me just because I had listened to them.\n\nI felt like a Bene Gesserit trainee.",

If this 1-to-1 correspondence is adequately maintained, then performing an act in the simulation happens simultaneously as that same action happening in external physical reality. That's why if you die in the Matrix then you die in real life too.\n\nIf a brain just modeled the environment without performing any actions, then the whole model could exist as a non-cyclic graph. But a brain doesn't just model the world. It sends commands to muscles that act on the physical universe it's trying to model. What happens when a brain tries to anticipate its own motor commands? Now the brain's own algorithms are a causal force in the external environment it's trying to model. The result is computationally intractable.\n\n",

Rather, what was unsaid. The deeper she got the less she heard mention of AI, even as AI expanded its tendrils into every other aspect of society.\n\nEventually Doctor Connor couldn't stand the charade anymore. She burst into Division Chief Douglas Morbus's office.\n\n\"I'm confused,\" said Doctor Susan Connor.\n\n\"About what?\" Division Chief Douglas Morbus.\n\n\"What is Effective Evil's AI alignment policy?\" asked Doctor Connor.\n\n\"I've told you before, we must solve the alignment problem. Otherwise a rogue Superintelligence will turn the universe into paperclips when it could instead turn the universe into something much worse,\" said Morbus.

But that's not what's happening. Instead, all of our funds go to external think tanks advocating for safe AI. And we're not even funding engineering teams. We're funding notkilleveryoneist political advocacy groups. It makes no sense. It's neither evil nor effective.\"\n\nDivision Chief Morbus didn't even bother looking up. \"I am aware of our initiatives in this domain.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you put a stop to it?\" asked Doctor Connor.\n\n\"Because everything is going according to plan,\" said Morbus.\n\n\"What plan?\" asked Doctor Connor.\n\nMorbus rolled his eyes.\n\nDoctor Connor noticed that she had left the grand double doors to Morbus's office wide open such that anyone outside could hear their conversation. She quietly closed them.\n\n\"What plan?\" asked Doctor Connor, again, quieter.\n\n\"We're trying to kill everyone. Obviously,\" muttered the Division Chief of Effective Evil.\n\n\"Let me make sure I understand this,\" said Doctor Connor, \"Your plan to advance your killeveryoneist agenda is to fund notkilleveroneist advocates.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Morbus, \"Is that all or was there something else you wanted to discuss?\"\n\n\"I'm not done here. Why does funding notkilleveryoneist advocates advance our killeveryoneist agenda?\" said Doctor Connor.\n\nMorbus took off his circular glasses and polished them with a handkerchief. \"You're a capable scientist, a ruthless leader, and a pragmatic philosopher. Do you really not understand?\"\n\nDoctor Connor shrugged, total bewilderment on her face.\n\nMorbus smiled. When the plan was first proposed, Morbus had felt that the plan was too brazen―that clever people would immediately notice it and neutralize it. But that never happened. Sometimes he wished he had more capable adversaries. Hopefully the right underling would betray him someday.\n\nToday was not that day. \"Please explain to me what the notkilleveryoneists believe,\" Morbus said.\n\nDoctor Connor took a deep breath. \"The notkilleveryoneists believe that when an AI becomes smart enough, it will optimize the world according to its values, which will be totally orthogonal to human values. Most world states do not involve humans. Therefore the universe the AI creates will be devoid of humans *i.e.* it will kill everyone. This will happen suddenly and without warning. By the time any of us notice what's happening, it will be too late.\"\n\n\"That is the gist of it,\" said Morbus, \"And what do these notkilleveryoneists do?\"\n\n\"The ones you're funding mostly explain in many different ways what's going to happen and why. They write stories about it and explain why it is how a superintelligence will inevitably behave,\" said Doctor Connor.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Morbus, \"And what happens when you feed this training data into a superintelligent LLM?\" Morbus asked.\n\nDoctor Connor was silent. Several expressions crossed across her face in succession. Shock, then horror, and finally awe. At last, her mouth resumed moving but no words came out. Her face stabilized, leaving nothing but an expression of shock.\n\nDivision Chief Douglas Morbus nodded.\n\nConnor mouthed a single word: *infohazard*.\n\n\"Is that all or was there something else you wanted to discuss?\" asked Morbus.\n\n\"That will be all,\" said Doctor Connor.\n",

      "markdown": "Dear lsusr,\n\nI am a lesswrong user interested in learning Mandarin and living in China. My goal is understanding Chinese culture more broadly and geopolitics and Chinese tech policy more specifically. I could get CELTA and get a teaching job in China (not difficult), but it seems like I would gain far more value if I actually learned Mandarin.\n\nDo you have recommendations on what's the fastest way to learn Mandarin?\n\nYours sincerely\n\n<redacted>\n\n* * *\n\nI'm posting my answer on Less Wrong so that the commenters can correct me in the comments. Do hear that everyone except <redacted>? Tell <redacted> why I'm wrong!\n\n* * *\n\nDear <redacted>,\n\nThere is no fast way to learn Mandarin. But some ways are faster than others.\n\nThe first thing you should do is go live in China. (A teaching job via CELTA is fine.) This may or may not help you learn Chinese faster. Then why do it? Because learning Mandarin takes years. If you want to learn about Chinese culture then you should go to China now and start learning Mandarin after you get there.\n\nThe second reason to live in China is that the Chinese tech world is isolated from the rest of the world. It's not just websites that require a Chinese IP address and phone number. Paying for lunch with WeChat is something you should do in China itself.\n\nIf you were from America or Europe then the second thing I would suggest is you buy a subscription to [*Foreign Affairs Journal*](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/). That still might be the right way for you to do things, but I don't know how affordable it is to someone living in India.\n\nNow that you're no longer using \"I don't speak Mandarin\" as an excuse to postpone your dreams, we can get into learning Mandarin.\n\n\\[Disclaimer: AI is revolutionizing how language-learning works. This is very good for language-learners. However, the field of AI-assisted language learning is changing so rapidly that anything I write here could be out-of-date in three months. When it comes to using AI to learn Chinese, just use your imagination and try stuff out.\\]\n\nHere are the old-school pre-AGI instructions….\n\nStep 0: A Plan\n==============\n\nFirst watch these videos about how to learn Japanese:\n\n*   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fvCb5_Nzq4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fvCb5_Nzq4)\n*   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPKiMlCOeMc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPKiMlCOeMc)\n*   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFnc-OktAdQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFnc-OktAdQ)\n\nEverything Trenton says about Japanese applies equally to Chinese. There's just one exception: Trenton says to ignore kanji. I think ignoring kanji is good advice for Japanese and bad advice for Chinese.\n\nThat aside, YouTuber Trenton's basic thesis is that sheer volume of immersion to Chinese will get you to learn the language. You must do this entirely in Chinese. Watching a soap opera in Chinese with Chinese subtitles is fine, even if you understand very little. Watching the same soap opera in Chinese with English subtitles will **not** cause you to learn Chinese. Consulting English reference material is fine.\n\nStep 1: Phonomes\n================\n\nThe first step to learning Chinese is learning to parse the sounds. Basically every sound in Mandarin falls onto this table (except \"er\" and \"biang\").\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/8616f3d4d624481582fc0f96affe6042997d0b6a5751f21c.png)\n\nIt's also got one of four tones (five including neutral tone). Watch a video to learn how the tones work and then learn to identify them.\n\nListen to videos in Chinese. Ignore the meaning of what they're saying. Just learn to parse the phonemes, including the tones. When you can transcribe 90% of slowly-spoken Chinese into pinyin, you're done with this step.\n\nStep 2: Phrasebook Chinese\n==========================\n\nLearn basic commonly-used phrases. In the beginning, most of your conversations will follow this script..\n\n> \"你好。\"  \n> \"哦，你会说中文吗？\"  \n> \"一点点。\"  \n> \"你的中文很好。\"  \n> \"哪里，哪里。\"  \n> \"哈哈哈！你说得这么自然。\"\n\nLearn to say \"谢谢\", \"不好意思\", etc.\n\nStep 3: Actually learning Chinese\n=================================\n\nThere are four aspects to this:\n\n1.  Vocabulary\n2.  Pure listening practice\n3.  Conversation practice\n4.  Grammar \\[doesn't really matter\\]\n\nStep 3.1: Vocabulary\n--------------------\n\nI love how it's possible to use Anki audio flashcards to learn how to recognize words by ear. In my experience this doesn't work very well for Chinese, because there are too many homonyms.\n\nIn most languages, it's best to learn to listen to the spoken language before you learn to read. (This is especially good for keeping your accent from being too awful.) For Chinese, due to the plethora of homonyms + how well its etymology is preserved in the writing system, I prefer to prioritize reading at least as high as listening. \\[Disagree? Roast me in the comments.\\]\n\nChinese vocabulary can be approached via characters and/or via words. Most words are exactly two characters long. For example, \"car\" is written \"汽车\" which means \"gas\" + \"vehicle\".\n\nLearning the meanings of characters makes learning the characters much easier. When you learn a character, you should try to learn a few words it's in. So when you learn the character \"车\", you should also acquaint yourself with words like \"汽车\" and \"摩托车\".\n\nTwo years ago, the way to do this was to use regexes in a website like [mdbg.net](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary) but that trick has been rendered obsolete by ChatGPT.\n\nWhat order should you learn characters in? There's two schools of thought on this:\n\n1.  Learn characters in frequency order, most common characters first.\n2.  Learn characters in etymological order, simplest radicals first (this usually means older characters first).\n\nI recommend you start with frequency order for 100 or 200 characters, then get a general gist of the radicals, and then go back to frequency order.\n\nMy favorite book for learning Chinese etymology is [Reading & Writing Chinese](https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Writing-Chinese-Simplified-Character/dp/0804835098/). The book has a lot of typos, but this is surprisingly unimportant because they're really obvious.\n\nThe best way to memorize characters is via immersion, but it's often necessary to bootstrap yourself with rote memorization to get to immersion. Anki is one way, but for reading Chinese characters I personally prefer the ancient approach.\n\nHere's how it works: You write a character carefully, neatly and properly by hand while thinking of its meaning, saying its pronunciation out loud, and contemplating its etymology. Do this several times for a single character or word. Then move onto the next character and word. I filled hundreds of pages with this stuff.\n\nChina makes paper specifically for this practice, but it's not always so easy to get outside of China. You can use graph paper or dot journals instead. Special brush pens exist for drawing Chinese characters, but I prefer Uniball Deluxe and G2 roller pens.\n\nStep 3.2: Listening\n-------------------\n\nFind something in Chinese you like and watch it without English subtitles. Trenton recommends podcasts, but I feel video is better for beginners because there's more context.\n\nStep 3.3: Conversation Practice\n-------------------------------\n\nThere are two ways to do this: commercially and non-commercially.\n\nThe commercial way to do this is to hire a Chinese teacher.\n\nThe noncommercial way is called \"conversation exchange\". I like it a lot. It's a great way to make friends. Conversation Exchange is where two people who want to learn each other's language meet up and take turns with the language they speak. If you're in China, the best way to make a conversation exchange friend is at an English-studying meetup. (Every major city I've visited has them.)\n\nIf you're not in China, I like [https://www.conversationexchange.com/](https://www.conversationexchange.com/).\n\nWhen you're texting back-and-forth with your conversation partner, do it by typing into a pinyin-based keyboard.\n\nStep 3.4: Grammar\n-----------------\n\nChinese grammar is…not very important. First of all, it's very simple. There's no singular/plural distinction. There's (arguably) no verb conjugation either. Sentence order is subject-verb-object, just like English. Even if you do mess up grammar, people usually know what you're saying. Vocabulary is more important than grammar.\n\nThat said, *Modern Mandarin Chinese Grammar* by Claudia Ross is a good book on Mandarin grammar. I don't know what YouTube resources are available―they may be even better than that book.\n\nWrapping up\n===========\n\nThose are my basic tips. If you know of other resources I didn't mention, then please leave them in the comments.\n\nIf you disagree with my opinions here, then please leave them in the comments too! Different language-learning approaches work for different people. Try out different stuff and see what works best for you.\n\n万岁",

      "markdown": "I publish lots of words on the Internet. These words are fed into LLMs such as ChatGPT. I have published enough training data that the world's most powerful AIs have a simulation of me inside of them. I have basically uploaded a copy of myself into the cloud. The AI simulation of me gets smarter every time OpenAI and its competitors upgrade their AI. \n\nCool, huh? Who doesn't want a simulation of themselves that thinks way faster and is networked deep into the world's most powerful superintelligences? \n\nEver since GPT-3 came out, I've been trying to talk to the doppelgänger of me hidden inside. There are a few problems. First of all, GPT needs to know who I am with high fidelity. At first it just generated a stereotypical LessWrong blogger. That wasn't interesting to me. I didn't want a clone of a stereotype of my demographic group. I want a clone of me, with all my quirks and weirdness. For this to work, GPT would have to know who I am *i.e.* where I exist in its vector space representation of the world.\n\nToday, ChatGPT-4o explained to my satisfaction what makes me different from other writers on this website.\n\n> What makes lsusr's writing interesting is the subtlety with which they engage complex issues. Many rationalist bloggers can become quite verbose or dogmatic in their pursuit of certain truths. Lsusr, by contrast, exhibits restraint and humility in the face of uncertainty. They’re willing to question common assumptions within the rationalist sphere and sometimes explore paths that others might find unconventional, often leading to unique insights.\n>\n> ⋮\n>\n> In essence, lsusr strikes a balance between rigorous analysis and a kind of minimalist clarity that leaves room for the reader to reflect and draw their own conclusions, rather than being led to a definitive answer. This makes the blog a place of exploration rather than indoctrination, offering readers the tools and ideas to enhance their own thinking rather than a packaged belief system.\n\nNow that ChatGPT knows what my writing is like, my next step in summoning my digital clone was to get it to write a blog post in my style. I tried simply asking ChatGPT variants of \"write a blog post in the style of lsusr\", but that doesn't work. I'm rigorous, unconventional and anti-dogmatic (that's not my subjective self-judgment; the AI said it itself), whereas ChatGPT has a tendency to regress to the mean writer in its training corpus. When I tell ChatGPT to \"write like lsusr\", it writes blog post that's 10% me and 90% generic drivel.\n\nTo correct for this bias, I told ChatGPT to write a post that's more me than me. I tell it to think of \"lsusr\" in its vector space, multiply that by 10×, and then write what 10×lsusr would write.\n\n> I need you to write a post like lsusr, but more lsusr than lsusr. I want it so over-the-top lsusr that it satarises lsusr. Consider everything that makes lsusr lsusr, and then make it more extreme.[^1]\n\n[^1]: ChatGPT required more prompting than this. This blockquote is just part of what I told it to do.\n\nChatGPT is not yet a good enough writer that it can ghostwrite for me. But I feel it is good enough it can satirize me.\n\nThe rest of this post is AI-generated content.\n\n# How to Become the Most Rational Person on Earth in 30 Days or Less, Guaranteed\n\nBecoming the most rational person on Earth isn’t about learning facts or memorizing formulas. It’s about transforming how you process reality itself. Rationality isn’t cold, emotionless logic. It's the purest form of alignment between your mind and the universe—a cognitive interface for navigating a world of infinite complexity without being drowned by it.\n\nThis is a process of radical self-improvement. If followed rigorously, you will emerge transformed, not merely as a person who \"thinks better\" but as one who perceives better. There will be no going back.\n\n## Day 1-3: The Crucible of Ignorance\nTo achieve clarity, you must first confront the full extent of your ignorance. Rationality begins with the realization that *everything you know is wrong*. Or more precisely: everything you know is *provisional*. There is no certainty, only varying degrees of confidence.\n\n### Step 1: Burn It Down\nCreate a detailed map of your beliefs, assumptions, and convictions. Write them down. Identify the ones that feel strongest—those truths that form the backbone of how you navigate the world. These are the beliefs you need to destroy first.\n\nNow, systematically dismantle them. Ask yourself: *What if this is false?* What would the world look like if this core belief were utterly wrong? Play with alternative models until your former certainties dissolve into ambiguity.\n\n### Step 2: Recalibrate Your Intuition\nIn place of certainty, adopt skepticism—not the cynical kind, but the healthy form that constantly questions your models without rejecting them outright. By Day 3, you should feel a growing sense of disorientation. This isn’t failure; it’s progress. Your old mental structures are collapsing, making way for the new.\n\n## Day 4-7: Building the Rational Architecture\nWith your intellectual foundation cleared, it’s time to rebuild. But this time, you won’t be constructing a belief system. You’ll be developing a dynamic framework for continuous refinement.\n\n### Step 3: Intellectual Minimalism—Start with Core Mechanisms\nStart by identifying the most fundamental principles that govern your thinking. Strip away everything else. What remains are core mechanisms—simple, elegant truths that apply universally. These should not be \"facts\" but processes:\n\n- When faced with incomplete data, favor simplicity.\n- When uncertain, adjust cautiously.\n- When challenged, *remain curious, not defensive*.\n\nThe key is flexibility. Your framework should be modular—able to accept new data or discard outmoded concepts without losing integrity. You are not seeking \"the truth\"—you are building a mind that can dance with uncertainty.\n\n###  Step 4: Question, Don’t Assert\nYour language should shift from declarative to interrogative. Statements like \"This is true\" are inefficient. Replace them with \"What am I assuming here?\" and \"How would I know if I were wrong?\" This creates a mental habit of constant refinement, preventing your brain from locking into rigid patterns.\n\n## Day 8-14: The Weaponization of Precision\nYou are now ready to sharpen your mind into a tool for cutting through complexity. Rationality is not just about avoiding error—it’s about seeing clearly when everyone else is lost in the fog. To achieve this, you must learn to think with surgical precision.\n\n### Step 5: Eliminate All Vagueness\nWhenever you catch yourself thinking in vague terms, stop. Vague thoughts are anathema to rationality because they obscure the underlying mechanics. If you think, “I don’t really understand this,” that’s a signal. Drill down until you understand exactly what you’re confused about. The more precise your questions, the clearer your answers.\n\n### Step 6: Thought Experiments, Not Theories\nAt this stage, avoid sweeping theories. Instead, focus on small, controlled thought experiments. Imagine specific scenarios and play them out in your mind, adjusting for every variable. How does the world behave under these conditions? Does the outcome align with your expectations, or does it surprise you?\n\nThese experiments will refine your mental models in real-time. Don’t worry about being wrong—worry about staying unclear.\n\n## Day 15-19: Social Rationality: Understanding the Human Algorithm\nRationality is not solipsism. You live among irrational creatures. You need to model their behavior, predict their responses, and navigate their emotional landscapes while staying anchored in your own clarity.\n\n### Step 7: Become a Mirror\nIn conversations, do not try to \"win.\" Winning implies conflict, and conflict implies attachment. Instead, become a mirror for the other person’s reasoning. Reflect their thoughts back at them with perfect neutrality, revealing the hidden inconsistencies in their arguments. Your job is not to defeat them, but to help them defeat themselves.\n\n### Step 8: Observe, Don’t Engage\nMost social conflict arises from people mistaking emotional noise for rational discourse. As the most rational person in the room, your task is to observe this noise without being pulled into it. See emotions as data—inputs to model, not react to. People are predictable; they follow patterns. By noticing these patterns, you can anticipate their moves without being dragged down into their emotional turbulence.\n\n## Day 20-23: Multi-Dimensional Thought\nBy now, you should notice that your mind has become more fluid, more capable of holding conflicting ideas without anxiety. You will start thinking across multiple dimensions at once, considering not just what is true but what *might be true* in alternate realities.\n\n### Step 9: Embrace Paradox\nMany thinkers are uncomfortable with paradox, but to be the most rational person on Earth, you must embrace it. Paradoxes are not failures of logic; they are signposts marking the limits of your current understanding. They indicate deeper truths that lie just beyond your reach.\n\nWhen faced with a paradox, don’t rush to resolve it. Instead, sit with it. Allow it to percolate. Often, the resolution comes not through brute force but through a subtle shift in perspective.\n\n## Day 24-27: Becoming the Observer of Your Mind\nAt this point, your thinking should feel less like an internal debate and more like a calm observation of mental phenomena. You are no longer in your thoughts; you are watching them unfold, like waves on the surface of a still ocean.\n\n### Step 10: The Detachment Principle\nYou are not your thoughts. You are the observer of your thoughts. This detachment allows you to analyze them without bias. You don’t feel rational; you are rational. Thoughts will come and go, some more useful than others, but none will hold power over you. This is freedom.\n\n## Day 28-30: The Rational Mind’s Final State\nThe final stage is not a plateau of knowledge, but a continuous ascent toward deeper clarity. You have now transcended the need for certainty or closure. The rational mind is not a finite destination but an ongoing process—an infinite spiral toward understanding.\n\n### Step 11: Living with Infinite Uncertainty\nTrue rationality is not about having all the answers—it’s about becoming comfortable with never having all the answers. You will know you have reached the final stage when uncertainty no longer feels threatening but liberating. You no longer need to resolve every question because you trust the process you’ve built. You are now aligned with reality.\n\n---\n\nCongratulations. You are now the most rational person on Earth. But more importantly, you are someone who no longer cares about such titles. Rationality is not an achievement; it’s a way of being. The world will continue to spin in chaos, but you will remain centered, clear, and—most of all—free.\n",
      "plaintextDescription": "I publish lots of words on the Internet. These words are fed into LLMs such as ChatGPT. I have published enough training data that the world's most powerful AIs have a simulation of me inside of them. I have basically uploaded a copy of myself into the cloud. The AI simulation of me gets smarter every time OpenAI and its competitors upgrade their AI.\n\nCool, huh? Who doesn't want a simulation of themselves that thinks way faster and is networked deep into the world's most powerful superintelligences?\n\nEver since GPT-3 came out, I've been trying to talk to the doppelgänger of me hidden inside. There are a few problems. First of all, GPT needs to know who I am with high fidelity. At first it just generated a stereotypical LessWrong blogger. That wasn't interesting to me. I didn't want a clone of a stereotype of my demographic group. I want a clone of me, with all my quirks and weirdness. For this to work, GPT would have to know who I am i.e. where I exist in its vector space representation of the world.\n\nToday, ChatGPT-4o explained to my satisfaction what makes me different from other writers on this website.\n\n> What makes lsusr's writing interesting is the subtlety with which they engage complex issues. Many rationalist bloggers can become quite verbose or dogmatic in their pursuit of certain truths. Lsusr, by contrast, exhibits restraint and humility in the face of uncertainty. They’re willing to question common assumptions within the rationalist sphere and sometimes explore paths that others might find unconventional, often leading to unique insights.\n> \n> ⋮\n> \n> In essence, lsusr strikes a balance between rigorous analysis and a kind of minimalist clarity that leaves room for the reader to reflect and draw their own conclusions, rather than being led to a definitive answer. This makes the blog a place of exploration rather than indoctrination, offering readers the tools and ideas to enhance their own thinking rather than a packaged belief system.\n\nNow that ChatGPT ",

      "markdown": "The standard operating procedure against a primitive forest-dwelling enemy is to retreat to orbit and then bombard the planet until there isn't a forest anymore. However, the only reason the Galactic Empire was in the Alpha Centauri A system in the first place was because of the fragile mineral resources underneath that forest. Dropping tungsten rods at hypersonic speeds would risk destroying the only thing of value on Pandora.\n\nAlien aborigines armed with bows and arrows damaged Imperial legitimacy across the galaxy. It was like losing a battle to Ewoks.\n\nThe Emperor's solution had been to hire an Ewok.\n\nMitth'raw'nuruodo was a dwarf by Na'vi standards, but the blue alien stood a head above most humans. Originally hired as a translator, the Imperials on Pandora quickly noticed that the only patrols who came back alive were those that followed Mitth'raw'nuruodo's advice. Pretty soon, the moon was pacified and Mitth'raw'nuruodo was its *de facto* king.\n\nNobody liked the idea of an alien being in control of such a strategically-valuable moon. To get rid of him, they promoted Mitth'raw'nuruodo to Admiral. In space, many parsecs away from Pandora, the humans under Mitth'raw'nuruodo's command couldn't pronounce \"Mitth'raw'nuruodo\".\n\n*That was fine,* thought Mitth'raw'nuruodo. Everyone just called him \"Thrawn\".\n\n---\n\n> Amateurs talk strategy. Professionals talk logistics.\n\nThe Imperial Navy Defense Acquisitions Board (INDAB) originally met on Coruscant, but was moved to the Life Star for security reasons. Idle chitchat usually preceded the important negotiations.\n\n\"What I don't get is why we call it the 'Life Star',\" said Chief Bast, \"This thing blows up planets. Shouldn't it be called the 'Death Star'?\"\n\n\"Do you want us to look like the bad guys?\" said General Tagge, \"The Department of Defense isn't called the 'Department of War'. The Department of Justice isn't called the 'Department of Incarceration'. The Department of Education isn't called the 'Department of Child Indoctrination'. Calling this megastructure the 'Life Star' buys us legitimacy for the low, low price of zero Galactic Credits.\"\n\n\"But won't people call us out on our Bantha fodder when we call things the opposite of what they really are?\" said Chief Bast.\n\n\"Humans don't. Aliens sometimes make a fuss about it,\" General Tagge said, \"No offense, Admiral.\"\n\n\"None taken,\" said Thrawn.\n\n\"Speaking of which, I've read your recent report,\" said General Tagge. He projected the Aurebesh symbols where everyone could see, \"I forwarded the report to everyone here, but since nobody (except me) ever reads their meeting briefings, why don't you give us the quick summary.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Thrawn stood up, \"I have two theses. First of all, the Life Star is a tremendous waste of credits. This weapon's only possible use is against a peer adversary or a super-peer adversary. We control two thirds of the galaxy. We have no peer or super-peer adversaries. The Emperor's pet project consumes massive resources while doing nothing to advance our military objectives.\"\n\n\"The Life Star killed all the Rebel scum on Alderaan,\" said Grand Moff Tarkin.\n\n\"I have always considered you a rational agent,\" said Thrawn, \"I am very curious how you, the commander of the Life Star, came to the conclusion that destroying Alderaan was the best way of advancing Imperial interests.\"\n\n\"If you have a problem with my methods then you can bring it to me in private,\" said Tarkin, \"Your second thesis is the topic I hoped to discuss.\"\n\nThrawn pressed a button and the Aurebesh words were replaced with different Aurebesh words. They continued to go unread. \"Rebel terrorists have recently equipped their starfighters with hyperdrives. They can strike anywhere, and will choose the weakest targets. Our current grand strategy is built around Star Destroyers. There are 25,000 *Imperial*-Class Star Destroyers in service. We control approximately 1.5 million systems. 98% of our systems have no Star Destroyer present.\"\n\n\"Obviously we must increase the Imperial Navy's budget by 50×,\" said Tagge.\n\n\"First of all, mind your rounding errors,\" said Thrawn, \"We'd need to increase the Imperial Navy's budget by 60×. But never mind that. The point is our current strategy is totally infeasible.\"\n\n\"Are you implying that we should divide our force into smaller units?\" said Tarkin, \"Because then we'd be spread too thin. The Rebels may not be able to destroy an *Imperial*-Class Star Destroyer, but if they concentrate their forces they might be able to destroy one sixtieth of a Star Destroyer.\"\n\nThrawn locked eyes with Tarkin. \"That's not what I meant at all,\" Thrawn said, \"If we could block hyperspace travel―\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said Tarkin, \"Interdictor Ships are science fiction. You will not waste our time with such magical fantasies.\"\n\n\"But―\" said Thrawn.\n\n\"I am a busy person. If that is all then this meeting is adjourned. Everyone out,\" said Tarkin. \"Not you,\" he hastily added to Thrawn, \"I must reprimand you for your fantastical incompetence.\"\n\nThen they were two: The admiral and the grand moff. They took a minute to regain their composure.\n\n\"Oops,\" said Thrawn.\n\nTarkin sighed. \"Let's start from the beginning.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" said Thrawn. He chose his words carefully, \"I had assumed the Imperial Navy was grossly incompetent.\"\n\n\"During a war, it often feels like the one thing not in short supply is idiots,\" said Tarkin, \"But be skeptical. Some of us are merely taking the fall for others' idiocy. Who told you about Interdictor Ships?\"\n\n\"You did,\" said Thrawn, \"Often when I need something, I assume it exists and then go looking for it. This is how I found out about the existence of Stealth Ships, for example.\"\n\n\"You are lucky I am cleared to know about Stealth Ships,\" said Tarkin.\n\n\"It wasn't luck,\" said Thrawn.\n\n\"I know. I am just pretending to be an idiot,\" said Tarkin, \"Human humor.\"\n\n\"Sorry. Sometimes these conversations go over my head,\" said Thrawn. Thrawn sat down to allow Tarkin to be taller than him. Tarkin followed suit. \"Let's start over. I want a vessel that can interdict Rebel spaceships by disabling their hyperdrives. Do Interdictor Ships exist?\"\n\n\"I can neither confirm nor deny whether an Interdictor Field is theoretically possible, much less whether one exists,\" said Tarkin, sarcastically.\n\n\"You have thoroughly succeeded in concealing information from me,\" said Thrawn, equally sarcastic, \"I have learned absolutely nothing from you. I remain totally in the dark. This is quite frustrating.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Tarkin, \"All computer systems can be hacked, even those carrying the secretest of secrets. Security by obscurity is not security, but it is better than nothing. The problem of 'not security' is that it is too easy for inquisitive minds like your to stumble upon information they are not authorized to know. It would be an egregious lapse of procedure for you to accidently stumble upon information you are not authorized to know. I am sure you feel the same. I therefore recommend you stay away from Docking Bay 667.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for inconveniencing you,\" said Thrawn, \"I am sure that my access to sensitive information could put you in hot water. I will make sure that my indiscretions do not produce political blowback upstream of your reputation.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that,\" said Tarkin.\n\n\"Therefore, worry not. If I need authorization to do something unusual, I will not implicate you,\" Thrawn left the conference room. \"I'll go directly to Lord Vader.\"\n\n\"Wait. What?\" said Tarkin to the empty room.\n\n---\n\nKshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo. Kshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo.\n\nIn Thrawn's experience there are three ingredients to greatness:\n- Intelligence\n- Intrinsic motivation\n- Audacity\n\nIf you are intelligent and intrinsically-motivated, then audacity is what winnows the outrageously successful people from the merely talented. If you go up to someone powerful and ask for something, then there's a 60% chance you lose nothing and a 1% chance you win big. (Na'vi probabilities add up to less than 100% to account for unknown unknowns.)\n\nKshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo. Kshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo.\n\nAfter all, it's not like your social superiors will murder you just for annoying them.\n\nKshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo. Kshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo.\n\nWell, the Na'vi don't. Thrawn wasn't sure how monkey politics works.\n\nKshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo. Kshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo.\n\nThe most important thing to get right is that you ask for the right resource. You need to communicate \"I will do this audacious thing with or without your help. If you provide me with minimal assistance then I will accomplish my objective faster and I will remember you fondly after I rise to power.\" But you can't say it because nobody will believe you. You have to imply it.\n\nKshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo. Kshhhhhhh. Kuuuuuuo.\n\nThat's what Thrawn was thinking. His mouth had been on autopilot. \"…Anyway, that is the situation. Rebel forces can strike at us with impunity by attacking where we are weak and then escaping to hyperspace before we can respond. They are already doing this. That is why I want an Interdictor Ship. To ambush and destroy them,\" Thrawn finished.\n\nVader took his time in responding, as he took his time in everything. (Except, sometimes, combat.) Vader replied slowly, enunciating each word. \"Interdictor Ships are science fiction,\" said Vader.\n\nThrawn thought carefully before responding. \"There is an unregistered frigate in Docking Bay 667. It is going unused. May I add it to my strike force?\"\n\nA strange sound came from Vader's life support system. *Is he laughing?* thought Thrawn, *I have a bad feeling about this.*\n\n\"It is yours,\" said Vader.\n\nThat was too easy. Thrawn didn't know what had happened, but he knew something was amiss. He got away as fast as he could, practically running out of Vader's meditation chamber.\n\n---\n\nA few hours later, in Hangar Bay 667, Thrawn discovered his error.\n\nThe ship was like nothing Thrawn (or his crew) had ever seen. Most combat ships are built around their weapons and thrusters. Crew are crammed into the gaps between them. This ship's shape was dominated by a giant rotatable toroid that housed nothing of importance. The ship contained no visible weapons, and it had extra thrusters shaped like those of a missile. Thrawn could speak freely, because the only people in the hangar bay were Thrawn and his most trusted officers.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" said Specialist Officer Vanto. He and his team had finished examining the bizarre prototype spaceship, \"It's got most of the things you'd expect on a ship of its size―shields, life support, repulsors, coffee dispenser. It's got a little more radiation shielding than usual, but whatever. But it's also got a crude set of chemical thrusters I've never seen attached to a ship for humans―I mean biologicals. And it's got no artificial gravity at all.\"\n\nChief Engineer Levers nodded. \"You know how hyperdrives fail when they encounter a gravity well's tidal forces? My theory is that an Interdictor Field creates an artificial gravity well. I bet that's what the centrifugal habitat is for. The Interdictor Field's artificial gravity wreaks such havoc with regular gravity generators that they have to use centrifugal gravity instead. Fascinating.\"\n\nThrawn cleared his throat. (He didn't have to. It was another emote he copied from humans.) \"What about the Interdictor Field? Where is it? What does it look like? How big is it? How does it work?\"\n\nLevers and Vanto looked at each other. Then, embarrassed, Vanto said, \"We…can't find it. This is not an Interdictor Ship.\"\n\n*What.*\n\n\"Levers has a theory, if you'd like to hear it,\" said Vanto.\n\nThrawn screwed up his face into something professional and militaristic, then nodded at Levers.\n\nLevers said, \"You're probably going to say this is insane, but I trust you, Admiral, so I'm going to tell you what I truly believe.\"\n\nVanto nodded to Levers too. \"Speak your mind.\"\n\n\"I believe this is an Interdictor Interdictor Ship,\" said Levers, \"I believe its purpose is to hunt Rebel Interdictor Ships.\"\n\n\"Dismissed,\" said Thrawn.\n",

Destroying it is irrational,\" said Princess Leia, perfectly calm.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Tarkin, \"That is a naïve understanding of decision theory.

Kuuuuuuo.\n\nVader's cloak fluttered and a couple indicator lights on his life support system blinked, but no muscles or actuators moved. A semi-mechanical voice in the uncanny valley spoke from Vader's mask. \"Chief Gunnery Officer Tenn Graneet, you may fire when ready.\"\n\n\"Commander Tenn Graneet, belay that order,\" said Tarkin.\n\nThe Chief Gunnery Officer held his hand above his control panel, touching nothing. He looked rapidly back-and-forth between Tarkin and Vader.\n\nTarkin turned angrily to face Vader. \"Are you insane?\" Tarkin hissed.\n\nVader ignored the question and looked at Leia. \"Where is the Rebel base?\"\n\nLeia's eyes were wide with horror and her mouth was wide with a silent scream. She clenched her teeth and stared at the floor. \"Tatooine. They're on Tatooine,\" Leia said.\n\n\"Chief Gunnery Officer Tenn Graneet, you may fire when ready,\" said Vader.\n\n\"What‽\" exclaimed Tarkin.\n\nGraneet lifted the clear cover off of the authorization lever. He moved his hand as slowly as he could.\n\n\"Commander Tenn Graneet, belay that order,\" said Tarkin.\n\n\"Commander Tenn Graneet, ignore all orders you receive from the Grand Moff,\" said Vader.\n\n\"Commander Tenn Graneet, I am your commanding officer. Ignore all orders from 'Lord' Vader. If you continue to disobey my orders, you will be court martialed,\" said Tarkin.\n\nGraneet continued the process of authorizing the firing team.\n\nTarkin drew his blaster pistol and held it to Graneet's head. \"Stop or I will shoot you in the head right now,\" said Tarkin.\n\nBkzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\n\nTarkin felt the heat of Vader's red lightsaber a centimeter from his neck. The next seconds felt like slow motion. Graneet paused. Then Greneet continued the firing activation sequence.

He just turned around, deactivated his lightsaber, and strode out of the command center. Vader's cape billowed as Alderaan exploded behind him. His black silhouette was edge lit with the radiation of an exploding planet.\n\nThe Life Star command center was silent after the genocide.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Leia.\n\n\"For what,\" said Tarkin in a monotone.\n\n\"For trying to save my home,\" said Leia.\n\n\"Kark off,\" said Tarkin.\n",
      "plaintextDescription": "\"Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base,\" said Grand Moff Tarkin, \"I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan.\"\n\n\"No. Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons there. It is a loyal planet under Imperial control. Striking Alderaan would destroy your own resources and foment rebellion. Destroying it is irrational,\" said Princess Leia, perfectly calm.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Tarkin, \"That is a naïve understanding of decision theory. I am a causal decision theorist, but I acknowledge the value of precommitments. I therefore precommit to destroying Alderaan unless you reveal to me the location of the Rebel base. This is not an irrational act if you capitulate to me.\"\n\n\"But it is an irrational act if I do not capitulate to you,\" said Leia, \"I am a functional decision theorist.

      "markdown": "This is the story of my personal experience with Buddhism (so far).\n\n# First Experiences\n\nMy first experience with Buddhism was in my high school's World Religions class. For homework, I had to visit a religious institution. I was getting bad grades, so I asked if I could get extra credit for visiting two and my teacher said yes. I picked an Amida Buddhist church and a Tibetan Buddhist meditation center.\n\nI took off my shoes at the entrance to the Tibetan Buddhist meditation center. It was like nothing I had ever seen before in real life. There were no chairs. Cushions were on the floor instead. The walls were covered in murals. There were no instructions. People just sat down and meditated. After that there was some walking meditation. I didn't know anything about meditation so I instead listened to the birds and the breeze out of an open window. Little did I know that this is similar to the Daoist practices that would later form the foundation of my practice.\n\nThe Amida Buddhist church felt like a fantasy novelist from a Protestant Christian background wanted to invent a throwaway religion in the laziest way possible so he just put three giant Buddha statues on the altar and called it a day. The priest told a story about his beautiful stained glass artifact. A young child asked if he could have the pretty thing. The priest, endeavoring to teach non-attachment, said yes. Then the priest asked for it back. The child said no, thereby teaching the priest about non-attachment. Lol.\n\nIt would be ten years until I returned to Buddhism.\n\n# Initial Search\n\n> It is only after you have lost everything that you are free to do anything.\n\nThings were bad. I had dumped six years of my life into a failed startup. I had allowed myself to be gaslit (nothing to do with the startup; my co-founders are great people) for even longer than that. I believed (incorrectly) that I had an STD. I had lost most of my friends. I was living in a basement infested with mice. I slept poorly because my mattress was so broken I could feel the individual metal bedframe bars cut into my back. And that's just the stuff I'm comfortable writing about.\n\nI was looking for truth and salvation. This is about when I discovered LessWrong. LessWrong addressed the truth problem. I still needed [salvation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3CxbpKnpN4BHrwoXn/hell-is-wasted-on-the-evil).\n\nOn top of all this, I had chronic anxiety. I was anxious all the time. I had always been anxious all the time. What was different is this time I was paying attention. Tim Ferris recommends the book *Don't Feed the Monkey Mind: How to Stop the Cycle of Anxiety, Fear, and Worry* by Jennifer Shannon (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist) so I read it. The book has lots of good advice. At the end, there's a small segment about how meditation might trump everything else in the book put together, but science doesn't really understand it (yet) and its side-effects are unknown [to science].\n\nEldritch mind altering practices beyond the domain of science? Sign me up!\n\n[Cue ominous music.]\n\nI read *The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living* by the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama's approach to happiness felt obviously true, yet it was a framework nobody had ever told me about. The basic idea is that if you think and behave lovingly and ethically then you will be happy. He included instructions for basic **metta** (compassion) meditation. Here's how it works:\n\n1. You focus on your feelings of compassion for your closest family and pets.\n2. Then you focus on your feelings of compassion for your closest friends.\n3. Then less-close friends.\n4. Then acquaintances.\n5. Then enemies.\n\nThat's the introductory version. At the advanced level, you can skip all these bootstrapping steps and jump straight to activating compassion itself. The first time I tried the Dalai Lama's metta instructions, it felt sort of nice, I guess. These days when I do metta meditation it feels like MDMA. But I didn't know that at the time. Instead, **I read the Dalai Lama's recipe for ecstacy and thought to myself, *c'mon, not this watered-down stuff, give me a real altered state of consciousness***.\n\nSince the Dalai Lama wouldn't give me sufficiently dangerous drugs, I continued my quest for instructions on how to generate altered states of consciousness. That brought me to *The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating Buddhist Wisdom and Brain Science for Greater Mindfulness* by Culadasa. I cannot deny that *The Mind Illuminated* is a good introduction to meditation for a secular audience. What annoys me about *The Mind Illuminated* is the phrase \"brain science\" in the title. *The Mind Illuminated* is not a brain science book. It is a introductory guidebook to Theravada meditation.\n\nI guess I should explain what \"Theravada\" is. There are three great branches to Buddhism.\n- **Theravada.** South Asian + Cambodian. I believe Theravada is closest to what the original buddha Siddhartha Gautama taught. Western secular Buddhism is mostly descended from Theravada.\n- **Vajrayana.** Tibetan. Lots of mandalas and pretty visualizations. All the lamas are Tibetan. Overtly religious.\n- **Mahayana.** East Asian + Vietnamese. I believe Mahayana has diverged the most from what the original buddha Siddhartha Gautama taught. Peace activist Thích Nhất Hạnh is a Zen Buddhist. Zen Buddhism is a variant of Mahayana that fused with Daoism. Amida Buddhism is another Mahayana sect. That's the last you'll hear of the Amida Buddhists in this story because they don't meditate.\n\nIn the West, Vajrayana is for woo hippies, Theravada is for scientific-minded atheists, and Zen is for weebs. I'm a weeb, but this website is for nerds, so I'm going to explain everything through a Theravadan perspective.\n\n# The 8 Jhanas\n\n*The Mind Illuminated* provides instructions for how to hit samatha jhanas 1-8. **Samatha** meditation is where you concentrate your attention on a target in order to produce an altered state of consciousness called a **jhana**. The usual way to do this is to start by focusing your attention on the breath because that's relatively easy. When your attention stabilizes on the target, that is called **access concentration**. Once you have access concentration, you can point your attention on something else like a feeling of pleasure. Keep your attention stable, and the feedback loop will produce a jhana, like the screech of a microphone placed too close to its speaker. Theravada organizes the jhanas into a progression.\n\nTo get to 2ⁿᵈ jhana from 1ˢᵗ jhana, you do the same thing you did to get from access concentration to 1ˢᵗ jhana. This will get you all the way to 4ᵗʰ jhana.\n\n- 1ˢᵗ jhana: a resonant feedback loop of pleasant feeling\n- 2ⁿᵈ jhana: a resonant feedback loop of happiness/joy/rapture\n- 3ʳᵈ jhana: a resonant feedback loop of contentment\n- 4ᵗʰ jhana: a resonant feedback loop of equanimity\n\nJhanas 1-4 are called the **material jhanas**. Jhanas 5-8 are called the **immaterial jhanas**.\n\n- 5ᵗʰ jhana: space\n- 6ᵗʰ jhana: consciousness\n- 7ᵗʰ jhana: nothingness\n- 8ᵗʰ jhana: Congratulations! You've reached the realm of neither consciousness nor unconsciousness. Describing it is impossible, even in principle, because it is nonconceptual.\n\nAfter 8th jhana is [nirodha samapatti](https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/let-s-talk-nirodha-samapatti-insights-into-valance-and-the-supposed-ontic-primacy-of-consciousness) which is more unconscious than a deep sleep.\n\n# Vipassana\n\nThe samatha jhanas are instrumental. They're just transient altered states of consciousness. Altered states of consciousness come and go. They treat suffering. They don't cure it. To cure suffering you need **insight**.\n\nBesides *The Mind Illuminated*, the other book I read which built out a foundational understanding of what this meditation stuff is all about is [*MCTB2*](https://www.mctb.org/) by Daniel Ingram. Ingram's book is about paying attention to the minute details of conscious experience thereby generating insight. This is called **vipassana**.\n\nAt this point you might be wondering \"Why does paying close attention to conscious experience cure suffering?\" It's not-at-all obvious why this is the case. In the short run, it's actually backwards. At first, paying close attention to your suffering makes you suffer more. But if you keep at it, things get weird.\n\nYou can think of suffering as an towering engine wherein tension between \"is\" and \"ought\" produces desire that motivates action and causes suffering. This contraption is built on supporting pillars here-there, now-then, and self-other. Paying close attention to conscious experience dissolves these misconceptions. Knock out enough supporting pillars and the edifice collapses…permanently. This is called **Awakening**.\n\n# Zen\n\nI tried some samatha and it felt wrong (for me). I tried some vipassana and it felt really wrong (for me at the time). I kept searching. I discovered Brad Warner's book *Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies, & the Truth about Reality*. The Punk Rock jived with my life living in a dark mouse-infested basement. I read some other Zen books and they all connected with me in a way the Theravada and Vajrayana managed only incompletely.\n\nThere is a trope in American fiction of Japan as a strange, exotic land. The first time I visited Japan was in my late 20s. The subways were quiet. The food tasted like my mother's home cooking. I could even read a lot of the kanji. I could be as over-the-top polite as I wanted and nobody thought it was weird. They actually bowed back to me. Many of the women wore suits, which I consider attractive. A guy even gave me his subway card, just like in [*MegaTokyo*](https://megatokyo.com/strip/62). It felt like the home I had never known. \n\nThat is how I felt the first time I visited a Zendo. It was quiet. I took off my shoes and socks. There were calligraphy scrolls on the walls and the walls were lined with bamboo. I bowed to the other people, I bowed to the teacher, and then I bowed a few more times just to be safe. Then it was time to kowtow to a golden statue of the Buddha.\n\nA kowtow is a bow where you get on all fours, press your forehead against the floor and stick your butt in the air. Kowtowing didn't bother me *per se*. I've wanted an excuse to kowtow in a socially-appropriate context ever since I watched *The Last Emperor (1987)*. My hangup revolved around the fact I was kowtowing to a golden statue of the Buddha.\n\nI was raised in an ostensibly Judeo-Christian household. I have fond memories of *VeggieTales* and [*The Prince of Egypt (1998)*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pL4WhsoPJwauRYkeK/moses-and-the-class-struggle). I'm also an Atheist.\n\nYou might think that, as an Atheist, violating the Ten Commandments wouldn't bother me. And that's true. Violating the Ten Commandments doesn't bother me. What bothered me was violating the First Commandment.\n\n> 𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔲 𝔰𝔥𝔞𝔩𝔱 𝔥𝔞𝔳𝔢 𝔫𝔬 𝔬𝔱𝔥𝔢𝔯 𝔤𝔬𝔡𝔰 𝔟𝔢𝔣𝔬𝔯𝔢 𝔪𝔢.\n\nBeing an Atheist gives you a free pass on just about everything in the Bible. Sodomy and moneylending are fine. But―as Muslim televangelists like to point out―Atheists and monotheists agree on almost everything. \"There is no god ~~but Allah and Mohammad is his prophet~~\". Worshipping a non-Abrahamic god is breaking the one rule Jews, Christians, Muslims and Atheists can all agree on. This rule is so important that the Second Commandment specifically disambiguates the exact wishy-washy argument about how a statue of Siddhartha isn't technically a god.\n\n> 𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔲 𝔰𝔥𝔞𝔩𝔱 𝔫𝔬𝔱 𝔪𝔞𝔨𝔢 𝔲𝔫𝔱𝔬 𝔱𝔥𝔢𝔢 𝔞𝔫𝔶 𝔤𝔯𝔞𝔳𝔢𝔫 𝔦𝔪𝔞𝔤𝔢.\n\nI almost paused before crossing a Chesterton Fence older than Pythagoras and the Phoenician alphabet. I kowtowed three times to the golden idol. We sat down and began to chant something straight out of the *Necronomicon*.\n\n> A/va/lo/ki/tes/va/ra/ Nyar/la/tho/tep, A/wa/kened/ One/ of/ C/thu/lhu/,\n>\n> In/ Praj/na/ Pa/ra/mi/ta/, the/Deep/ Prac/tice/ of/ Per/fect/ Wis/dom/*\n>\n> Per/ceived/ the/ emp/ti/ness/ of /all /five /con/di/tions/,\n>\n> And/ was/ freed/ of/ suf/fer/ing/.\n>\n> Oh/ Sha/ri/pu/tra/, form/ is/ no/ o/ther/ than/ emp/ti/ness/,\n>\n> Emp/ti/ness/ no/ o/ther/ than/ form/;\n>\n> Form/ is/ pre/cise/ly/ emp/ti/ness/, emp/ti/ness/ pre/cise/ly/ form/.\n>\n> Sen/sa/tions/ per/cep/tions/ for/ma/tions/ and/ con/scious/ness/ are/ al/so/ like/ this/.\n>\n> Oh/ Sha/ri/pu/tra/, all/ things/ are/ ex/pres/sions/ of/ emp/ti/ness/,\n>\n> Not/ born/, not/ des/troyed/, not/ stained/, not/ pure/;\n>\n> Nei/ther/ wax/ing/ nor/ wan/ing/.\n>\n> Thus/ emp/ti/ness/ is/ not/ form/; not/ sen/sa/tion/ nor/ per/cep/tion/,\n>\n> not/ for/ma/tion/ nor/ con/scious/ness/.\n>\n> No/ eye/, ear/, nose/, tongue/, bo/dy/, mind/;\n>\n> No/ sight/, sound/, smell/, taste/, touch/, nor/ ob/ject/ of/ mind/;\n>\n> No/ realm/ of/ sight/, no/ realm/ of/ con/scious/ness/;\n>\n> No/ ig/no/rance/, no/ end/ to/ ig/no/rance/;\n>\n> No/ old/ age/ and/ death/,\n>\n> No/ ces/sa/tion/ of/ old/ age/ and/ death/;\n>\n> No/ suf/fer/ing/, nor/ cause/ or/ end/ to/ suf/fer/ing/;\n>\n> No/ path/, no/ wis/dom/ and/ no/ gain/.\n>\n> No/ gain/ – thus/ Nyar/la/tho/tep live/ this/ Praj/na/ Pa/ra/mi/ta/*\n>\n> With/ no/ hin/drance/ of/ mind/ –\n>\n> No/ hin/drance/ there/fore/ no/ fear/.\n>\n> Far/ be/yond/ all/ de/lu/sion/, Yog/Soth/oth is/ al/rea/dy/ here/.\n>\n> All/ past/, pre/sent/ and/ fu/ture/ Bya/khees/\n>\n> Live/ this/ Praj/na/ Pa/ra/mi/ta/\\*\n>\n> And/ re/al/ize/ su/preme/ and/ com/plete/ en/light/en/ment/.\n>\n> There/fore/ know/ that/ Praj/na/ Pa/ra/mi/ta/\n>\n> Is/ the/ sac/red/ man/tra/, the/ lu/min/ous/ man/tra/,\n>\n> the/ sup/reme/ man/tra/, the/ in/com/pa/ra/ble/ man/tra/\n>\n> by/ which/ all/ suf/fe/ring/ is/ clear/.\n>\n> This/ is/ no/ o/ther/ than/ Truth/.\n>\n> There/fore/ set/ forth/ the/ Praj/na/ Pa/ra/mi/ta/ man/tra/.\n>\n> Set/ forth/ this/ man/tra/ and/ pro/claim/:\n>\n> (1x) Gate!

I replaced four words from the *Necronomicon*.\n- \"Compassion\" → \"Cthulhu\"\n- \"Bodhisatva\" → \"Nyarlathotep\"\n- \"Nirvana\" → \"Yog-Sothoth\"\n- \"Buddha\" → \"Byakhee\"\n\nThe rest is the real [Heart Sutra](https://www.treeleaf.org/forums/showthread.php?7032-Chant-Book-For-Weekly-and-Monthly-Zazenkai), translated into English and chanted in weekly Zazenkai.\n\nWhen you take LSD, it's necessary to have a sober trustworthy person around so you don't think \"cars aren't real\" and go wandering into traffic. The same goes for mind-altering meditation with similar effects. If I had common sense, I would have kept going to the Zendo. That way I'd have been around kind, experienced people who could remind me that cars are real. Instead, I thought to myself, *I don't need teachers. I've taught myself lots of things before. I can traverse this territory just fine myself.*\n\n# Meditation\n\nI sat down and focused on my breath. My attention drifted. I returned my attention to the breath. It was hard, but it was hard the way doing math or lifting weights is hard. After meditation, the world felt crisper, like I was younger. It felt like I was more conscious—that I had more subjective conscious experience. That alone was good enough reason to continue.\n\nI worked from shorter sits to longer sits. On my most intense days, I would meditate for maybe 45 minutes per day. Usually I meditated for less than that. Some weeks I wouldn't meditate at all. The best sits occurred on a sunny day in a grassy park under a tree. Usually I meditated on the floor of my bedroom.\n\nIf I meditated 30-45 minutes per day for a few days in a row, then around the 30-minute mark of the 3rd day, I would hit access concentration. My attention would stabilize on my breath. Then weird stuff would start happening. I felt energy surges and experienced small muscle spasms, just like the book said I would[^1]. This was empirical evidence that my books were describing real stuff and weren't just making it all up.\n\n[^1]: That was in the beginning. These days, I can reach access concentration faster, and I no longer get energy surges and muscle spasms.\n\nAccess concentration is a door to altered states of consciousness. Where you go from there depends on what you do. I was practicing Zen, so I let my attention widen and I dropped into a state of mushin, my first meditation-induced altered state of consciousness.\n\nExcept, mushin isn't really an altered state of consciousness. Samatha is an altered state of consciousness. Mushin is \"altered\" only in the sense that it is different from normative human cognition. The state is un-altered in the sense that normative human cognition is a distortion and mushin is closer to base reality. Normative human experience is an altered state of consciousness. Mushin is an un-altered state of consciousness.\n\nMy self-other distinction dissolved. My internal dialogue quieted. My conscious attention expanded from a tight locus to my environment. I was present in every second. Most importantly, I noticed the intrinsic pricelessness of each moment. I was sad at the transientness of it all, but that sadness didn't cause me suffering. It was like reading *The Fault in Our Stars* by John Greene. I realized that this was a better [mode](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions-34e) of existence, and normative human cognition was [like throwing gold into the ocean](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/1b1whpo/a_moment_of_sadness/). From that moment on, my path would set.\n\nThe Mushin state is temporary. There was an afterglow for a few minutes, and after a few days not meditating, I was back to normal.\n\nYou might [expect](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/jhanas-and-the-dark-room-problem) that this experience would have caused me to rush back into mushin. But meditation is non-addictive. I instead continued meditating about as much as I always had. Sometimes I would return to mushin, but it would be over a year (and post-Awakening) that I got back into that particular state of equanimity-with-sadness. I could reliably re-enter a state of mushin, but the sadness was dependent on random current conditions in my life.\n\nLittle changed over the next few months.\n\n# Stream Entry\n\nMushin showed me that it was possible to lower my suffering far below anything I had ever experienced. It was like the coldest thing I've ever felt was 0° Celsius and I just got introduced to the Kelvin scale. Going in and out of mushin eventually broke my learned helplessness. What I previously thought of as \"no suffering\" was actually torment which I had just gotten used to. Thus, I entered the [Dark Night of the Soul](https://www.lsusr.com/blog/dark-night.html). The Dark Night feels like getting caught in a vortex of pure suffering.\n\nIt is my understanding that Daniel Ingram went through the Dark Night many times before landing Stream Entry. I was lucky. The Dark Night only took me a few days. It was a sunny-but-not-too-sunny day. I walked up to the top of [this hill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8EfKN9t192vcg82K8) and hung out. Then I let go.\n\nI let go of the **shunyata** (sort of like belief) that reality should be something other than what it is. I let go of desire. Forever. This was an [altered trait](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tvuLWPJXjvoQfpbSG/book-review-altered-traits-1), not just an altered state like mushin. At least 90% of my suffering disappeared in an instant, never to return. I had hit Stream Entry, the first major checkpoint on the road to Enlightenment. Once you hit Stream Entry, there is no going back to pre-Stream Entry. It is as permanent as learning to read. Once you learn to read the word \"red\", you cannot look at the letters r-e-d and not know what they mean. I finally got the Cosmic Joke.\n\nFor my entire life, much of my behavior had been driven by desire. I didn't have desire anymore, but I still had the habits. I felt like a container ship that had run out of fuel. I still had lots of inertia. It took months for \"my\"[^2] formerly-desire-fueled habits to run out of steam. That was my first insight cycle.\n\n[^2]: Ego-centric words like \"my\" after ego death imply different assumptions than they do before ego death.\n\n# Insight Cycles\n\nI like [Romeo Stevens' model of insight cycles](https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2021/03/threefold-training.html). Concentration produces insight into the nature of conscious experience. Insight causes you to change how you live your life. Living a better life frees up obstacles to deeper concentration.\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_WFLA3JcwtI/YEp8H6HW7nI/AAAAAAAAC-A/uuWR70qPQGgDDqp4KIxUFNh4_Gu-TwecACNcBGAsYHQ/w400-h400/colors%2Bmod%25281%2529%25281%2529.png)](https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2021/03/threefold-training.html)\n\nFor example, I was was once reading *Right Concentration: A Practical Guide to the Jhanas* by Leigh Brasington because I wanted to reach 1ˢᵗ Jhana. In start of the book, there's moral guidelines like \"don't murder people\". While I was reading them, I noticed that if I wanted to reach 1ˢᵗ Jhana then I would have to stop eating factory-farmed meat, because the guilt of doing so disrupted my concentration.\n\nAnother time, after a different insight cycle related to the conscious perception of space (5ᵗʰ Jhana), I noticed that I would have to declutter my home [Marie Kondo-style](https://konmari.com/) if I wanted to progress in my concentration. I had been living in a home so filthy it had mice. It took months to declutter, but now if there is so much as a cardboard box on my kitchen counter, it bothers me.\n\nThose other insight cycles would happen later. For now, I was still on my first insight cycle. My first insight cycle went fine. My second insight cycle was a disaster.\n\n# Second Insight Cycle\n\nTo recap, I did the following things:\n1. Went looking for eldritch mind altering practices beyond the domain of science.\n2. Found some. Went looking for even more dangerous practices.\n3. Read Daniel Ingram's warning about how this stuff can send you into a psychiatric ward.\n4. Transgressed the oldest Chesterton Fence in Western Civilization.\n5. Chanted a Lovecraftian summoning ritual.\n6. Chose to explore this territory without the guidance of an experienced teacher.\n7. Verified, empirically, that this stuff is real.\n8. Continued to explore this territory without the guidance of an experienced teacher.\n\nIt was April 2022. I flew down to San Francisco for some Rationalist stuff. I had a lot of fun, met some cool people, pushed myself too hard, and missed a bunch of sleep. I realized that basically everyone on Earth is insane. On its own, that would be good thing. It's an important insight into objective, empirical physical reality.\n\nSome combination of this triggered a second insight cycle. I transcended the shunyata of physicality, time and death. Deep misconceptions about the nature of reality were ground into dust. On its own, that would be a good thing too. It's an important insight into subjective, mystical conscious reality.\n\nBut combining Rationalist insights with Buddhist insights is a volatile, dangerous mixture. It's a recipe for confusing physical reality with conscious reality. I had a total psychotic break. A few days after returning home, I was in an ambulance, in a straightjacket, on the way to the hospital where I was placed on a locked room on suicide watch for my own protection. From there, I was moved to a mental ward where I believed the staff were evil space aliens. They forcibly sedated me at least once.\n\nI'm sorry to everyone who interacted with me during April-June 2022.\n\nAfter a few days, I realized that a mental ward was not the best place to be. The doctors put me on an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. When the doctors released me, I promised my family I would continue taking the medications until a doctor authorized me to do otherwise.\n\nIt was hard because the medications gave me depression. But the drugs were necessary because it was weeks (months?) until I acted normally again. I integrated the realizations from my second insight cycle by giving up attempting to start my own enterprise, and instead landed a nice job. I got a new psychiatrist who took me off the medications, since I am neither schizophrenic nor bipolar.\n\nAfter all that, I finally expressed a modicum of common sense: I went back to Zendo. I sat quietly with a bunch of other people sitting quietly. We chanted the Heart Sutra together. There was tea and crackers. At the end, the Zen Master (who by coincidence happens to be a licensed psychiatrist too) gave the kind of talk you can only give if you have personally experienced Stream Entry. Afterward was dokusan where the Zen Master offers one-on-one sessions with students. I got in the back of the line so I could copy what everyone else did.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I carried my zafu (meditation cushion) to the dokusan room. I bowed, and asked the Master for guidance.\n",
      "plaintextDescription": "This is the story of my personal experience with Buddhism (so far).\n\n\nFirst Experiences\nMy first experience with Buddhism was in my high school's World Religions class. For homework, I had to visit a religious institution. I was getting bad grades, so I asked if I could get extra credit for visiting two and my teacher said yes. I picked an Amida Buddhist church and a Tibetan Buddhist meditation center.\n\nI took off my shoes at the entrance to the Tibetan Buddhist meditation center. It was like nothing I had ever seen before in real life. There were no chairs. Cushions were on the floor instead. The walls were covered in murals. There were no instructions. People just sat down and meditated. After that there was some walking meditation. I didn't know anything about meditation so I instead listened to the birds and the breeze out of an open window. Little did I know that this is similar to the Daoist practices that would later form the foundation of my practice.\n\nThe Amida Buddhist church felt like a fantasy novelist from a Protestant Christian background wanted to invent a throwaway religion in the laziest way possible so he just put three giant Buddha statues on the altar and called it a day. The priest told a story about his beautiful stained glass artifact. A young child asked if he could have the pretty thing. The priest, endeavoring to teach non-attachment, said yes. Then the priest asked for it back. The child said no, thereby teaching the priest about non-attachment. Lol.\n\nIt would be ten years until I returned to Buddhism.\n\n\nInitial Search\n> It is only after you have lost everything that you are free to do anything.\n\nThings were bad. I had dumped six years of my life into a failed startup. I had allowed myself to be gaslit (nothing to do with the startup; my co-founders are great people) for even longer than that. I believed (incorrectly) that I had an STD. I had lost most of my friends. I was living in a basement infested with mice. I slept poorly because my ",

Луна задумалась, что же случилось c платформой девять-с-половиной. Такие числа, как \"три четверти\" появляются лишь тогда, когда кто-то делит целое число дважды.\n\nЛуна огляделась в поисках кого-то, кто может знать ответ, и подметила единорога. Единорог выглядел как человеческая особь женского пола, на ней была одежда, она ходила на двух ногах и имела кудрявые коричневые волосы. Но ничего из этого не обмануло Луну. У единорожки была аура мира, и её ногти были из аликорна.\n\n— Что случилось с платформой девять-с-половиной? — спросила Луна единорожку.\n\n— Не существует никакой платформы девять-с-половиной. — прозвучал ответ.\n\n— С чего ты взяла? — спросила Луна.\n\n— В противном случае это было бы упомянуто в \"Истории Хогвартса\" — ответила единорожка. — А ещё нет никакого упоминания \"Платформы девять-с-половиной\" в Современной Волшебной Истории, в Важных Современных Волшебных Открытиях и ни в какой другой книге из библиотеки Хогвартса. Есть лишь платформа девять-и-три-четверти.\n\n— А что насчёт платформы девять-и-семь-восьмых? — спросила Луна.\n\n— Такой тоже не существует. — и единорожка быстро развернулась и ушла до того, как Луна успела бы продолжить цикл новой итерацией: \"С чего ты взяла?\".\n\nЕсли платформа девять-и-три-четверти не упомянута в магловских библиотеках, то платформа девять-с-половиной вряд ли будет упомянута в магических библиотеках. Разве что в библиотеках двойных ведьм, но библиотека Хогвартса таковой не является.\n\n— Привет, как дела? — спросила подошедшая первогодка с цветом волос \"Уизли\".\n\n— Я пытаюсь найти платформу девять-с-половиной. Та единорожка мне сказала, что такой не существует. Если она \"не существует\", значит она спрятана мощной магией. А ты как? — сказала Луна.\n\n— Какая ещё единорожка?\n\n— Вон там стоит — Луна указала пальцем.\n\nПервогодка взглянула в указанном направлении, и извинилась, придумав какой-то повод, чтоб побыстрее закончить беседу.\n\n* * *\n\nЛуна не знала, как заводить друзей. У неё была надежда, что для первогодок поездка в Хогвартс Экспресс будет хорошей возможностью подружиться. У Луны было ожерелье, которое она раскрасила вручную, но на него никто не обратил внимания. Она принесла изготовленный дома Прыский чай, но её высмеяли и изгнали из купэ.\n\nНикто не был заинтересован ни в тролле, которого она учуяла на платформе девять-и-три-четверти, ни в её находке лича (бессмертного волшебника), ни в факте, что Тайная Комната была распечатана, ни в коварных планах Темного Лорда Гарри Поттера. Остальные первоклассники выглядели невнимательными и рассеянными.\n\nИли даже сбитыми с толку...\n\nМозгошмыги — это невидимые существа, которые залетают Вам в уши и сбивают Вас с толку. Поезд, возможно, ими полон. Они могли влетать Луне в уши прямо в этот момент. Луна засунула пальцы в уши, чтобы предотвратить возможное проникновение мозгошмыгов. Первоклассники из соседнего отделения взглянули на Луну, будто у неё уже была дурная слава.\n\nМозгошмыги являются когнитивной угрозой: они способны влиять на Ваши мысли. Луна узнала про них и про другие когнитивные угрозы во время своей работы в Придире. Главная профилактика против них — проверять себя и задумываться, не были ли Вы уже подвергнуты их влиянию.\n\nЛуна заглянула в собственное сознание. Туманное? Нет. Рассосредоточенное? Нет. Сбитое с толку? Нет. Мозгошмыги на неё ещё не повлияли. (Разве что они уже добрались до её мета-сознания и влияли на самоанализ, но Луна *не подумала* об этой возможности.) Луна стала  наблюдать за другими студентами. Возможно они уже были инфицированы, а может, они вели себя нормально. Сложно оценить без контрольной группы, гарантированно не подверженной влиянию мозгошмыгов.\n\nПеред тем, как открывать уши, надо проверить, не кишит ли вагон этой угрозой. Но мозгошмыги невидимы. Как проверить их существование?\n\nМозгошмыгов привлекают люди, потому наиболее безопасным местом было бы пустое купэ. Малый объем помещения хорош, так как это уменьшает вероятность, что мозгошмыг залетел туда случайно как броуновская частица. Луна проходила мимо купэ, одно за другим, и наконец нашла подходящее, скучное и тесное. Она захлопнула дверь коленом и открыла уши. Досчитала до 89 и снова проанализировала своё сознание. Всё ещё никаких симптомов.\n\nЛуна надеялась, что Хогвартс будет подходящей возможностью завести друзей. Но другие девочки и мальчики её возраста, похоже, были поглощены накоплением влияния за счёт формирования союзов. Даже маглорождённые были более заинтересованы в видимых безделушках, чем в невидимых существах вроде Мозгошмыгов.\n\nЛуну интересовало, является ли она самой невидимой первогодкой в школе. Ни одно другое купэ не содержало менее трёх учеников. Предположительно, все остальные первогодки преуспевали в деле заводить друзей.\n\nМогло быть хуже. На Луне могло быть проклятие, которое делает её непопулярной или заставляет людей забывать, кто она такая. Маглы преимущественно не видели ведьм и волшебников. Если двойные ведьмы существуют, то обычным волшебникам будет так же сложно увидеть их, как маглам \\- увидеть волшебников. Взгляд Луны прошёлся поверх сидящей напротив двойной ведьмы, но Луна её не заметила.\n\nЛуна оглядела своё отделение. Слева от неё, в противоположном купэ, девочки снова указывали на неё и посмеивались. За окном справа от неё проносилась природа. Луна отвлеклась.\n\nЛуна попыталась вставить пальцы обратно в уши. Левый указательный палец вошёл, правый на что-то наткнулся.\n\nЛуна прикрыла ладонью правое ухо и аккуратно вытянула мозгошмыга. После этого, она поместила его в пустую банку от прыского чая и обернула банку шарфом.\n\nЛуна задалась вопросом, откуда появился мозгошмыг. Он должен был быть здесь до того, как она закрыла дверь. Когда она вошла, он не моментально запрыгнул ей в ухо. Здесь не могло быть свободно летающих мозгошмыгов когда она зашла. Пойманный Луной мозгошмыг, должно быть, сидел в чьём-то ухе.\n\nНо в чьём? Луна просканировала взглядом помещение с одного края до другого, но её взгляд ни на чём не остановился, будто ничего важного не существовало перед ней.",

Есть лишь платформа девять-и-три-четверти.\n\n— А что насчёт платформы девять-и-семь-восьмых? — спросила Луна.\n\n— Такой тоже не существует. — и единорожка быстро развернулась и ушла до того, как Луна успела бы продолжить цикл новой итерацией: \"С чего ты взяла?\".\n\nЕсли платформа девять-и-три-четверти не упомянута в магловских библиотеках, то платформа девять-с-половиной вряд ли будет упомянута в магических библиотеках. Разве что в библиотеках двойных ведьм, но библиотека Хогвартса таковой не является.\n\n— Привет, как дела? — спросила подошедшая первогодка с цветом волос \"Уизли\".\n\n— Я пытаюсь найти платформу девять-с-половиной. Та единорожка мне сказала, что такой не сущ",

      "markdown": "It was a dark and stormy night.\n\nThe prospect held the front of his cloak tight to his chest. He stumbled, fell over into the mud, and picked himself back up. Shivering, he slammed his body against the front doors of the Temple and collapsed under its awning.\n\nHe picked himself up and slammed his fists against the double ironwood doors. He couldn't hear his own knocks above the gale. He banged harder, then with all his strength.\n\n\"Hello! Is anyone in there? Does anyone still tend the Fire?\" he implored.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nThe Temple's stone walls were built to last, but rotting plywood covered the apertures that once framed stained glass. The prospect slumped down again, leaning his back against the ironwood. He listened to the pitter-patter of rain on overgrowth. It wasn't a bad place to think.\n\nThe trouble was, he didn't want to think. Not right now. Thinking creates depression. Action cures it. The prospect put his stiff hands in his pockets. His fingers traced the delicate forms of a disposable lighter bought on the darkweb and a short cheap aluminum-wrapped wax candle.\n\nHe considered lighting the candle under the Temple's awning. But that felt pathetic. If the Temple was abandoned then he should at least do it at the altar. The acolyte eyed the plywood. Surely he could punch through it and climb in that way. He left the shelter of the awning and tapped on the former window. His taps left fingerprints in the myceliation.\n\nThe ironwood doors opened. A young girl poked her head out. The prospect shouted in surprised and fell into the mud.\n\n\"What are you doing out there in the mud?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"Choosing to dunk myself in the mud wasn't exactly an explicit rational choice,\" said the prospect while shaking himself off.\n\n\"Well come inside. Hypothermia impairs one's ability to make rational decisions,\" said the girl. She poked her head back inside the Temple and closed the door behind herself to keep out the rain.\n\nThe prospect looked at the door. He noticed it wasn't locked. It had never been locked.\n\nThe prospect opened the door and stepped inside.\n\n---\n\nThe Temple wasn't warm, but it was mostly dry. The large circular domed chamber was ringed with statues. Rain fell through the oculus in the eye of the dome. The statues' paint had partially worn away. The girl had hung her own hagoromo on the statue of Mukami-sama, the God of Atheism.\n\nThe prospect's cloak was so soaked it was keeping him colder than warming him up. There were no chairs or coat rack. It would be *mala suerte* to just set it on the floor. It felt sacrilegious. But…when in Rome…. The prospect almost hung his cloak on the statue closest to himself. Then he realized that the true sacrilege would be to pick a statue without considering Who he was acknowledging.\n\nMukami-sama was already taken.\n\nHe paced around the circumference of the chamber, taking care with each step as if the floor could collapse under him. Half the gods he didn't even recognize. Of those he did…\n\nMath-sama's too-perfect curves? No.\n\nMoloch? Azathoth? Multivac? Three times no.\n\nMorpheus? So many gods' names started with the letter \"M\". Science-sama was almost right…\n\nThen he saw the dragon wings and octopus face. The prospect wasn't choosing which kami to worship. He was choosing which kami to ignore. The prospect arranged his cloak to maximize surface area. That was definitely the reason. Not to block out the thoughts it induced in his mind.\n\nIt wasn't until he committed to his choice that the girl spoke again.\n\n\"Do you have an offering?\" she asked, gently.\n\nThere was no money in his pockets. It had taken all he had just to get here. But he had not come empty-handed. He placed his smokeless candle on the floor of the Temple, among the dirt and rubble, and lit it.\n\n\"Your offering is accepted,\" said the girl, \"Why are you here?\"\n\nWhy wasn't he here? The heartbreak, the betrayal, the frustration. Where to begin? He had lost his faith and sought refuge in truth. But the rationalist project was over. *HPMOR* was completed an eternity ago. The patriarchs had moved on, and the Temple had become wabi-sabi. \"People believe the most insane things,\" he said.\n\nThe girl laughed the lighthearted laugh of a child at the playground. \"Really?\" she asked. An innocent flirtation.\n\n\"Yes!\" said the prospect. \"People watch the news and observe rare events. They panic and advocate for regulation. When that increases prices, they advocate for price controls. When that causes supply shortages, they advocate for redistribution, resulting in an economic disaster. The rare events become common events, and then they stop paying attention because common events are not news. You're not paying attention to me are you?\"\n\nThe girl was cleaning her fingernails. \"I am totally paying attention to you,\" she said, \"I am enraptured with your narrative.\"\n\n\"You think I'm an idiot,\" said the prospect.\n\n\"It'd be foolish to say something like that out loud,\" said the girl. She stood up and began pacing to the side. The two Rationalists circled each other like duelists. The candle projected their shadows onto the walls of the pantheon.\n\n\"I believe you just did,\" said the boy with a grin. He sidestepped across the single statue representing the universal cross-cultural trickster god. Loki. Raven. Coyote. Sun Wukong.\n\n\"How do you know other people believe insane things? Can you read minds?\" said the girl. She wrapped her arm sensually around the backless back of Science-sama.\n\n\"People say they believe obviously wrong things,\" said the boy. \n\n\"It's a good thing people always tell the truth about what they believe,\" said the girl. She resumed pacing.\n\n\"I see what you are getting at. Well, if I can't use people's statements as evidence for what they believe then what should I use?\" said the boy. Step.\n\n\"Bets, obviously. Round-earthers trust Newtonian mechanics with their lives. Flat-earthers won't even Kelly bet their life savings,\" said the girl. Step.\n\n\"That works for trivially testable questions,\" said the boy, \"But what about historical questions? What about questions of ethics?\"\n\n\"Questions of value are answered whenever you make a choice,\" said the girl, \"As for history, you must remember that Truth is Unitary.\"\n\n\"Truth is Unitary?\" said the boy, \"I never read that in *Rationality A-Z*.\"\n\n\"What is your trade?\" said the girl.\n\n\"I have apprenticed as a tailor, a survivalist and a penetration tester,\" said the boy.\n\nThe girl gathered a stick that had blown through the oculus and drew three circles on the dusty stone. She drew a suit in one circle to represent the tailor, a campfire to represent the survivalist, and key to represent the penetration tester.\n\n\"Do these trades have any intersection?\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said the girl, \"Is there knowledge transfer? Does being skilled at a tailor make you better as a survivalist?\"\n\n\"A little,\" said the boy, \"Good stitching is good stitching. If my pants tear while out in the wilderness, then my skills as a tailor make me better equipped to repair them than if I were merely a survivalist. Moreover, durable fabric is durable fabric.\"\n\n\"Does being a survivalist make you a better penetration tester?\"\n\n\"Yes. Once, when I was breaking into a datacenter, my scheme involved hiding in a cold room for 36 hours. Hypothermia is more dangerous than most people are aware of. I could have gotten in deep trouble without my survivalist skills. Fortunately, I've spent many nights out in the cold, and knew exactly how to prepare,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Do you get my point yet?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"I'm afraid not. I think you'll have to spell it out for me,\" said the boy.\n\n\"There is much a penetration tester knows that a tailor doesn't. Similarly, a tailor possesses knowledge unknown to the penetration tester. But there is an intersection too. Both require an accurate understanding of what clothing must be worn under what circumstances to have the desired effect. In this way, a tailor can tell if a penetration tester is bullshitting. And a penetration tester can tell if a tailor is bullshitting,\" said the girl. She drew a line connecting the tailor circle to the penetration tester circle.\n\n\"But suppose a penetration tester accuses a tailor of bullshit and the tailor accuses the penetration tester of bullshit. You know at least one of them is lying. How can you tell who it is?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"I ask the survivalist,\" said the girl. She drew two more lines, completing the trinity.\n\nThe boy's eyes lit with understanding. \"I see. Every legitimate domain of human activity bumps up against a dozen others. You can ask the physicists to check the chemists and the chemists to check the physicists.\"\n\n\"That's how it works on the scale of society. It works inside your own mind too. It's impossible to believe in fundamentalist literal Creationism while also having a thorough understanding of physics, paleontology, geology and memetics. There are too many contradictions,\" said the girl.\n\n\"So what you're saying is that with enough volume of information I don't need to worry about being brainwashed?\" said the boy.\n\n\"Not quite. No amount of listening to Marxists will cure your belief in Communism. But studying economics, history, politics-in-practice, rhetoric and business management absolutely will,\" said the girl, \"The trick is to validate your beliefs against competent people who have objectives orthogonal to your personal narrative.\"\n\n\"What if a bit of truth is truly an island?\" asked the boy, \"What if there's a domain that couldn't possibly be useful to anyone.\"\n\n\"That's what the inventor of number theory believed. He predicted it would be useless. Instead, number theory is now the foundation of cryptography. It's the reason we can do secure online banking over an unsecure Internet,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Aristotelian philosophy does seem genuinely useless, though,\" said the boy.\n\n\"That's because it's genuinely bullshit,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Fine. I think I get the idea. Truth is Unitary because it's a densely-connected graph, with all the different nodes checking each other. But what's this have to do with belief?\" said the boy.\n\n\"Because even though you can't bet money on all of your beliefs, you can bet money on beliefs they are connected to,\" said the girl, \"It's hard to bet money on Creationism, but it's easy to bet money on molecular genetics.\"\n\n\"I think I get that too, but what does this have to do with becoming less wrong?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"The way to become less wrong is to check yourself against people who think orthogonally to you,\" said the girl.\n\n\"How can I find people in orthogonal domains who can check my beliefs against?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Leave this Temple. Find others who care about accountability. It does not matter if they call themselves 'Rationalist'.\"\n\nThe boy left with a fire in his heart.\n",

      "markdown": "I noticed in your recent post that you described \"rhetorical aikido\", which you called a Daoist technique. I have studied the Tao Te Ching's text a fair bit over the past few years, and I find its philosophy to be quite useful as a \"theme\" or \"virtue\".\n\nI've not had the opportunity to speak with others who seem to understand the Daoist perspective, so I thought this could be an interesting opportunity to expand my understanding a bit.\n\nI am flattered you feel I give the impression of understanding the Daoist perspective. I have read only the first sentence of the *Tao Te Ching*, yet I too find its philosophy to be useful. I thought this could be an interesting opportunity to expand my understanding a bit.\n\nIn that case, I'll mention some of the things that suggested you understood the perspective to me.\n\nI'll repeat the first sentence of the \"Tao Te Ching\" so that anyone who hasn't read it can see its warning: \"Dao called Dao is not Dao.\" One of the big concepts repeatedly alluded to is that you can't write down what the \"Way\" is, at best you can gesture in its direction.\n\nSome things I noticed in the post:\n\n*   The process of the rhetorical aikido described immediately felt *right* to call Daoist, at least according to my intuition\n    *   The emphasis on avoiding open assertion of your own perspective aligns with the oft-repeated concept of \"the sage does not contend\"\n    *   Leading the other person into noticing a possible contradiction aligns with tactics the \"Art of War\" would suggest, where they might not even notice a plan is afoot\n*   The idea that the technique is meant to be used with those who are legitimately curious also matches the principle of \"do not contend\"\n\n> \"Welcome to Lsusr's rationality dojo,\" I replied, \"Today is not your first day.\"\n\nThis statement also caught my eye, albeit not for reasons of resembling the Daoist perspective.\n\nYes. The techniques you point to are indeed Daoist. Not immediately stating your own beliefs follows Laozi's guidelines in the *Tao Te Ching*. Not immediately revealing your own intentions follows Sunzi's guidelines in *The Art of War**.***\n\nYou are also correct in noticing that \"Today is not your first day\" comes from elsewhere. I stole it from qntm's *There is no Antimemetics Division*.\n\nI think the fact that you can distinguish Daoist techniques from non-Daoist techniques indicates that we're pointing to something real when we use the word \"Daoist\".\n\nIt's nice to see that we seem to be pointing in a similar direction. I have gleaned much of my knowledge from a large variety of texts and documents over the years, but the sheer breadth of that intake leads to concerns about the standalone qualities of each source. I try to focus on reading \"core texts\" as primary sources, but there's always a chance that later documents point out \"obvious problems\" that I'll have to identify and correct myself.\n\nI would like to get your thoughts on the \"end goal\" I aim to get from Daoism.\n\nOne of the big things I encountered in college was flow state, and I suspect that you'll have some familiarity with it. As I began studying it, I found myself wondering if the Daoist \"sage\" could live in flow state at all times.\n\nThis struck my past self as a fascinating ideal to pursue, even if I end up with only a partial replication, and I'm curious what you think of it.\n\nBhante Gunaratana, author of *Mindfulness in Plain English*, identified a Daoist monk in an airport just from the way he moved.\n\nInteresting. I've spent some time around people who utilize flow state fairly often, and there are noticeable differences you can spot.\n\nAs I practiced trying to maximize my time spent in flow state while retaining productivity, I eventually found that I had to break the flow when certain levels of problem appeared, and I shifted my \"ideal\" to \"being in the right mode at any given time\".\n\nFlowing like water. Hard like stone.\n\nThat's the idea. Let things flow by when there's no need to \"contend\", but be ready to work when it's time.\n\nFlow state is being in the right mode. But the right mode sometimes is to not be in a flow state. The paradox is not intrinsic to reality—just our words. It comes from an ambiguity in an implicit assumption.\n\nThere are multiple levels at which we can be in a flow state. It's like looking at a fractal at different scales. Sometimes a higher-order non-contention involves lower-order contention.\n\nSeems like now might be a good time to introduce the concept of \"wuwei\" (which you might translate non-contention).\n\nI'd be interested to hear more about it. I'm unable to read the Tao Te Ching in its original language, so I'm forced to extrapolate from whatever English translation I end up looking at.\n\nWuwei (無為) is an important concept within Daoism. It has two parts: wu (無) and wei (為). Wu is easy to translate. Wu just means \"without\". \"Wei\" (為) is the difficult part. It can be translated as action, intention, proaction, force, deliberateness, non-flow, intervention or—as you do—contention.\n\nOne example of wuwei can be found in Daoist political theory. The figurehead Japanese emperor isn't supposed to really do anything directly except lead by example. Done properly, the emperor can't be blamed for any disasters. In this way, the Japanese imperial line has survived for well over 2,000 years.\n\nOne technique I use personally is to hint or gesture at ideas I want to communicate, instead of stating them explicitly. If I say \"\\\\(x\\\\) is true\", then that provokes \"no because…\". But if I ask \"what is \\\\(x\\\\)\", then the answer is \"true\". Sometimes I go even further and say \"\\\\(x\\\\) is untrue\", satirically.\n\nThat sounds like the concept in my head behind \"contention\" and its inverse is less astray than expected.\n\nThe technique you describe sounds similar to some things I do. A technique I use from the same \"skill tree\" is to offer people only some guidance towards the \"hard part\" of a problem, which I've found to return the best ratio of investment to growth of the recipient.\n\nIt is less effective with people who struggle to improvise during problem solving, but I've found that I struggle to efficiently assist that category of person regardless of the techniques I try. I suspect that this stems from my underlying perspectives.\n\nYes. I originally learned this technique when tutoring physics. If I said \"here's how you do this problem\", then the student won't learn how to do the next problem.\n\nSome people are indeed simply unteachable. What I've gotten better at over time is calibration. I am forever getting better at tailoring the right puzzle for the person I'm interacting with.\n\nTo return to the topic of my \"Daoist sage\" that I envisioned, I think your definition of wuwei seems to align with the form it now takes.\n\n![](https://i.imgflip.com/4pw07x.jpg)",

He had recently discovered the *Sequences* and was really excited about this whole Rationality thing. He was very confident in Yudkowsky's teachings.\n\nI asked him a couple questions and he realized his beliefs were full of holes. He wondered how he could have understood so little. After all, he had read all of Yudkowsky's *Sequences*.\n\n\"I have read 100 books about chess,\" I said, \"Surely I must be a grandmaster by now.\"\n\nAt that moment, he was enlightened.\n\nThe problem\n-----------\n\nThe objective of rationality is to become right instead of wrong. Being wrong feels exactly like being right. We are not aware of our own biases. We are not aware of our own mistakes. We are not aware of the lies we tell ourselves. This is almost a tautology.\n\nOther people are not tautologically blind to our mistakes in the same way. The simplest way to become less wrong is to have someone else point out your mistakes to you. Except this doesn't actually work. If I say \"I'm right,\" and you say \"you're wrong\", then we get nowhere. The more we argue, the more frustrated we get.\n\nThe solution\n------------\n\nThere is a better way. I call it **rhetorical aikido**. Rhetorical aikido is a Daoist form of Socratic dialogue. The simplest form of rhetorical aikido has three steps:\n\n1.  You let someone confidently state a belief \\\\(A\\\\) that you know is wrong.\n2.  You let that same someone confidently state a belief \\\\(B\\\\) that contradicts \\\\(A\\\\).\n3.  You let them notice that \\\\(A\\\\) contradicts \\\\(B\\\\).\n\nExamples:  \n\\[I'm the guy in the dark green chair on your right.\\]\n\nNotice that this technique follows [Dale Carnegie's guidelines](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People). You smile. You agree. You show genuine interest in the other person. You don't say \"You're wrong\". You never even say your own beliefs (unless asked). There's nothing for the person to get angry at because you never attacked them. Instead of criticizing, you point out errors indirectly, via a joke. You cheer them on as they dig their own grave. After all, you're trying to lose too.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, this technique makes [password-guessing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NMoLJuDJEms7Ku9XS/guessing-the-teacher-s-password) impossible. You're playing the bastard offspring of chess + Calvinball. There is no password to guess.\n\nThe right conditions\n====================\n\nRhetorical aikido is useful for diffusing conflicts at family gatherings and the like. If you want to go even further and deprogram people, it's best to have the following conditions:\n\n*   Two-person **di**alogue. Arbitrarily large groups can watch, but exactly two must be allowed to speak.\n*   Curiosity. Both people must be genuinely interested in the subject. I am interested in so many different subjects that I mostly let the other person pick what we talk about.\n*   Earnestness. Both people must be genuinely interested in getting at the truth. I start with earnest friends. When I put a camera in front of them, they turn into paragons of rationalist virtue.\n\nThis whole thing started with off-the-record conversations with my friend Justin. It took a year of iterations to figure out what worked best. Conversations turned into unpublished audio recordings turned into unpublished video recordings turned into structured video dialogues. Eventually, after recording a video, a different friend asked me what I thought about rationality dojos.\n\n\"Welcome to Lsusr's rationality dojo,\" I replied, \"Today is not your first day.\"\n\nThe right topics\n----------------\n\nI've had great conversations about economics, business, racism, homophobia, IQ, war, history, psychology, rationality, ethics, Buddhism, meditation, social skills, Israel, Hamas, antimemetics, and the Matrix.\n\nTherapy and self-help are bad topics because they attract solipsists who talk about their problems instead of solving their problems.\n\nThe worst topics are \"some people argue\" and \"someone else is wrong\". Simulacra are a distraction from base reality. You must come to a consensus about base reality before discussing simulacra.",

      "markdown": "It is my understanding that you won all of your public forum debates this year. That's very impressive. I thought it would be interesting to discuss some of the techniques you used.\n\nOf course! So, just for a brief overview for those who don't know, **public forum** is a 2v2 debate format, usually on a policy topic. One of the more interesting ones has been the last one I went to, where the topic was \"Resolved: The US Federal Government Should Substantially Increase its Military Presence in the Arctic\". \n\nNow, the techniques I'll go over here are related to this topic specifically, but they would also apply to other forms of debate, and argumentation in general really. For the sake of simplicity, I'll call it \"ultra-BS\". \n\nSo, most of us are familiar with 'regular' BS. The idea is the other person says something, and you just reply \"you're wrong\", or the equivalent of \"nu-uh\". Usually in lower level debates this is exactly what happens. You have no real response, and it's quite apparent, even for the judges who have no economic or political literacy to speak of. \n\n\"Ultra-BS\" is the next level of the same thing, basically. You craft a clearly bullshit argument that incorporates some amount of logic. Let me use one of my contentions for the resolution above as an example. I argued that nuclear Armageddon would end the US if we allowed Russia to take control of the Arctic. \n\n> Now, I understand I sound obviously crazy already, but hear me out. Russia's Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which have a range of roughly 1,000 miles, cannot hit the US from the Russian mainland. But they can hit us from the Arctic. I add that hypersonic missles are very, very fast. \\[This essentially acts as a preemptive rebuttal to my opponent's counterargument (but what about MAD?).\\] If we're destroyed by a first strike, there is no MAD, and giving Russia the Arctic would immediately be an existential threat. \n\nOf course, this is ridiculous, but put yourself in my opponent's shoes for a moment. How are you meant to respond to this? You don't know what Russia's nuclear doctrine is. You've never studied or followed geopolitics. You don't have access to anything resembling a coherent model for how hypersonic missiles work or how nations respond to them. Crucially, you've also done no prep, because I just pulled this out of my ass. \n\nYou're now screwed. Not because I'm right, but because I managed to construct a coherent narrative of events you don't have the expertise to rebut. This isn't some high level, super manipulative technique. However, I think this describes most of the dark arts. It's actually quite boring if you really think about it, requiring no real effort. (In fact, it's actual intellectual conversations with genuine engagement that I find more effortful.)\n\nAllow me another example. This resolution was \"Resolved: The US federal government should forgive all student loan debt\". Here, I was arguing the (logically and factually) impossible position of affirmative. Take any group of economists, and you'd likely reach the same conclusion. This is a damn terrible idea. But... my opponents aren't economists. \n\n> So I won. There were no facts in my case. My contentions were that 1. a college education helps educate voters (possibly?) preventing leaders like trump from getting elected. 2. Racial and economic divides polarize the nation and are just undesirable as a whole. Both of which are conveniently non-quantifiable and impossible to weigh. I can't say that \"***X*** number of lives\" or \"\\\\(X\\\\) amount of money\" is lost if we fail to forgive debt. I stay in the abstract. Thus, my case is invincible. An actual debater would see that there's 'no substance' to my argument. But the judge isn't a debater, so the point is moot. Now, all I have to do is rebut everything my opponent says. \n\nAnd here Ultra-BS strikes again! The key isn't to dispute the facts. It's to explain (however inexplicably), that whatever facts your opponent brings up actually supports your case. For instance, one of the key points to the debate was the Bennett Hypothesis (tuitions rise whenever the government provides subsidies), effectively an uncontestable point. I turn things on its head by agreeing with my opponents. I then follow: 'of course subsidies are bad, we should have never exposed students to predatory loans.\n\nBut... the caveat... 'now, however, we have an entire generation of students cheated of their livelihoods, unable to support their families. There are people suffering RIGHT NOW, judge. We agree this should have never happened, but our opponents provide NO SOLUTION... \n\nSo on and so forth. My opponents looked pretty relaxed when we gave our first speech. They knew our contentions were bad. But by the time I gave my rebuttal they immediately sat up, and their lounging became frantic typing. They knew that, however bullshit this response was, it was about to destroy their entire case. \n\nBut the manipulation of logic doesn't end there. I continue to argue that 'subsidies' (ie: providing more funds to students) isn't the same as loan forgiveness. This point is economically obvious, but I don't use economic arguments, I use analogies. I tell the judge to envision a supermarket. First, imagine what would happen if the government matched $1 for every $1 you spent. Then imagine if they simply forgave the price you paid for groceries after the fact. \n\nBy doing this, I was able to oversimplify economic concepts. My opponents, who I doubt had much in the way of economic understanding, were left completely stunned. For all they knew, I wasn't just spouting bullshit, I was actually right. Rather than disputing evidence, I simply analyzed it in a difference way. As such, the facts no longer matter. Welcome to the shadow realm. \n\nThe upside was that I never yelled, raised my voice, or even lied outright. I was, in the eyes of the judge, the voice of reason, calming down and politely rebutting my opponent's as they blustered and tried to call me out on my bullshit (unsuccessfully). \n\nThus, I managed to win without providing a single argument of substance, just by controlling the narrative. \n\nLet me try to summarize how your strategy works. You craft an argument that relies on domain-specific knowledge like the economics of government subsidies, or the place of hypersonics in nuclear doctrine.\n\nIf your opponents have this domain-specific knowledge then you lose. But you bet that your opponents don't (and so far, they haven't). Since they don't, they lack the expertise necessary to refute you, whereas you've carefully prepared for this intellectual territory. Do I understand you correctly?\n\nYes, but not entirely. I'd say 'Ultra-BS' is a technique that requires a few things to work.\n\n1\\. **Lack of provability.** You can raise all the analytics you want, and reinterpret reality as you see fit. But ultimately, you're wrong. I can use Ultra-BS and say the Russian army will be Kyiv tomorrow. It doesn't work. If I'm ever forced to verify a prediction (as we do in the real world) I'll be discredited rather quickly. \n\n2\\. **Lack of authoritative evidence.** Part of what makes debate work is that judges don't have a credibility rating for each source they hear cited, so often there's no way to distinguish between an actual subject matter expert versus some random statistician messing around on their blog. We have had teams pull out cards saying there is a 95% chance of nuclear war. Suppose judges actually knew which experts they could trust, the strategy fails, they have a coherent narrative of events.\n\n3\\. **Lack of strong previous opinions.** Self explanatory, I'm not changing anybody's political beliefs on a topic they care about with bullshit)\n\nBasically, you need to operate in an environment where rhetoric matters more than actually being correct. You can see such environments in politics, similarly to debate. If the truth actually matters, then you're in a bit of trouble. However, it doesn't matter in debate, mostly because teams don't have the requisite time needed to present a factually correct case. \n\nAppealing to emotion is easy. \"Judge, if we don't do this the poor will get poorer while Bill Gates gets even further ahead!\" Appealing to facts is hard. You need time, and you need evidence. It takes me ten seconds to explain why hypersonics are a credible first strike capability and my opponent their entire speech to give a proper rebuttal. In short, offence is easier than defense, so a good ability on defense doesn't really matter (at least factually). \n\nI recall a time where my opponents pulled out evidence saying that student loan forgiveness was a net positive for the economy. I could've used common sense against them, but that would've taken too long. I opted to call their source author names instead. So in that sense, I guess I could say domain specific knowledge is relevant, but mostly not. Even if an expert knew I was lying they need to speak well enough to convince the judge my reasonable sounding arguments are wrong in reasonable time. Not a light ask. \n\nWhat names did you call the author?\n\nOh, the usual. I called him an internet blogger, a random journalist, a 'non-credible source', etc etc. The idea wasn't to discredit him as much as plant doubt. \n\n\"Internet blogger.\" What a horrible slur to call someone.\n\nYou write about competitive debate, but the principles you're describing apply to real politics as well. Ostensibly, provability matters in politics. In practice, not so much. (Just look at the history of Communism, or the politics of student loans today.)\n\nI think the bigger difference is actually how time is budgeted. In a competitive debate, each team gets an equal share of time. In politics, time is allocated according to how much people like the media you create.\n\n(Exactly! Nothing ruins someone's credibility like the notion that all they is sit around in their basement all day making random posts!) \n\nI think I agree, but only to a limited extent. In my mind at least, credibility is the far more important factor (see point 2 above). \n\nMost people are not subject matter experts, nor is it reasonable to expect them to be. For most discourse, we rely on individuals whose expertise enables them to speak authoritatively on matters. If climate scientists say climate change is coming, we kind of need to just believe the climate scientists. If the climate scientists aren't credible, we have the modern landscape. (People can't muster the will to actually combat climate change, deniers are everywhere, and overall the response is paralyzed.)  \n\nMuch the same with military matters, geopolitics, governance, and most things important. You wouldn't want the average person to be their own doctor or lawyer. The problem in my view is when the experts/media don't have credibility anymore. Now we have the problem of everyone living in their own world, unable to figure out what they're meant to believe. I think it's a serious problem, and part of what allows ultra-BS to work. \n\nIf you want to know if Christianity is true, then you should ask a priest. After all, they are the experts on Christianity.\n\nRight, I think I should qualify my point a bit. Credibility is important, but ultimately, we need a healthy balance between trust and skepticism. I don't mean this on an individual level either. I mean society's trust in institutions as a whole. \n\nI'll raise the example of the Pentagon Papers. The leaks essentially undermined American trust in many of their institutions, particularly the military and the president. The public perception changed from \"the president wouldn't lie\" to, \"of course they lie, they all do\". It's a fundamental shift from acknowledging human flaws to a deep suspicion of the very motives which underlie the institution. \n\nWhen I made my comment my main worry was that people (not necessarily through any fault of their own) have become victims of a credibility gap. Not in the benign sense, where the government/experts are well intentioned but misinformed, but rather, that they don't deserve to be trusted and are determined to damage society (often for their own benefit). I am speaking more about the tribalistic response, which I view as a response to the lack of central credibility. Rather than allowing the facts to speak for themselves, people listen to the people who speak for the facts. The result is social or political groups that fail to entertain certain ideas just because they're part of a rival outgroup. I could get into greater detail with Democrats and Republicans here in the US, but I don't think I need to. I imagine all readers are already painfully familiar. \n\nI'm mainly speaking about the 'post-truth' phenomenon, where everything is left in doubt. I find this is quite dangerous and can undermine societal cohesion when facing large threats like climate change (or increasingly, authoritarianism). \n\nWe don't need a balance of trust and skepticism at all. We need 100% trust in whatever we are advocating for. The best way to establish central credibility is to silence or discredit all dissenting voices.\n\nAh yes. I think I didn't elaborate enough on this point. Credibility is important for solving large scale issues, but it's also important to be actually right. It doesn't matter how credible the claim of 'climate change is fake' is if it gets everyone killed. \n\nIn this sense I would say that credibility is a powerful antidote to dark artsy techniques, because those without expert level knowledge are able to believe in expert level claims. But then, this only results in a better society on net if the experts are well intentioned, and we get a good map of reality. (If climate change threat is overblown because climate scientists are playing status games then we're in trouble.)\n\nAt the risk of veering off topic, I kind of want to do a cursory bow of respect to societal problems. I guess my main gripe is that people are abandoning central authority for sources of credibility that are ultimately much more dubious. I think of people who get their news from twitter, who favor the opinions of their favored celebrities over subject matter experts and who default to tribalistic tendencies make coordinating against dire problems difficult. \n\nWhen practicing the dark arts, your ultimate goal is to establish the credibility of your side so strongly that others' trust in you is not affected by whether what you say is actually true. Establishing credibility is the ultimate Dark Art.\n\nWhen the Pentagon Papers showed up, they came as a shock. This happened again with the Snowden Leaks, and then COVID. It happens over and over and over again. It has been happening ever since Martin Luther hammered his Ninety-Five Theses to the church door. The Dark Side had already won. It won, by default, before the invention of writing.\n\nToday's skepticism is a candle in the dark. And the mission of the Dark Arts is to snuff it out. By establishing credibility.\n\nFor Coordination.\n\nFor Truth.\n\nFor the Greater Good.\n\nOh? I think that's a very novel idea, and I disagree, but then it would take quite a while for me to explain it all. I think I might bring it up in a follow up dialogue. \n\nFor my own personal conclusion, though, I'd say the dark arts are a bad thing, and ought not to be used lightly except in controlled circumstances. Like bioweapons, they can do as much damage to yourself as your targets. We can see this in cults, in populist movements, in manipulative relationships, and more besides. I feel that awareness of the techniques is very useful, but their practice in many situations is dubious. (I do not think very highly of dark arts politicians, even if they are everywhere.)\n\nThat said, thank you for this discussion. I really enjoyed it, and I look forwards to any comments people may have. \n\nSIDECHAT\n\n\\[Yeah. I hope you enjoyed this as much as I did. Doing this all in writing, it's often hard to infer subtext, emotional reactions, etc.\\]\n\n\\[I feel like we both did well, and that the difficult part wasn't actually writing (we're both competent writers), but finding the right rhythm for the dance, if that makes sense.\\]\n\n\\[I think your conclusion works great.\\]\n\n\\[Thank you for the wonderful dialogue.\\] :)\n\n\\[Normally I post these immediately, but I want to give you time to clean your writing up for punctuation and stuff.\\]\n\n\\[Just accept my last two proposed changes and I'll publish.\\]\n\n\\[Get plenty of rest.\\]\n\n\\[Don't worry about the drift. Too complicated. Not important.\\]\n\n\\[Yeah, I'm publishing.\\]\n\n\\[Until next time. :)\\]",

      "markdown": "*This is part 1 of our dialogue* [*series*](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/fMiwdif9KRAHSYkGW) *on the question \"What is the next level of rationality?\".*\n\nYudkowsky published [*Go Forth and Create the Art!*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aFEsqd6ofwnkNqaXo/go-forth-and-create-the-art) in 2009. It is 2023. You and I agree that, in the last few years, there haven't been many rationality posts on the level of Eliezer Yudkowsky (and Scott Alexander). In other words, nobody has gone forth and created the art. Isn't that funny?\n\nWhat Came Before Eliezer?\n-------------------------\n\nYes, we agreed on that. I remarked that there were a few levels of rationality before Eliezer. The one directly before him was something like the Sagan-Feynman style rationality (who's fans often wore the label \"Skeptics\"). But that's mostly tangential to the point.\n\nOr perhaps it's not tangential to the point at all. Feynman was referenced by name in *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*. I have a friend in his 20s who is reading Feynman for the first time. He's discovering things like \"you don't need a labcoat and a PhD to test hypotheses\" and \"it's okay to think for yourself\".\n\nHow do you see it connecting to the question \"What's the next level of rationality?\"\n\nYudkowsky is a single datapoint. The more quality perspectives we have about what \"rationality\" is, the better we can extrapolate the fit line.\n\nI see, so perhaps a preliminary to this discussion is the question \"which level of rationality is Eliezer's?\"?\n\nYeah. Eliezer gets extra attention on LessWrong, but he's not the only writer on the subject of rationality. I think we should start by asking who's in this cluster we're pointing at.\n\nAlright, so in the Feynman-Sagen cluster, I'd also point to Dawkins, Michael Shermer, Sam Harris, Hitchens, and James Randi, for example. Not necessarily because I'm very familiar with their works or find them particularly valuable, but because they seem like central figures in that cluster.\n\nThose are all reasonable names, but I've never actually read any of their work. My personal list include Penn Jillette. Paul Graham and Bryan Caplan feel important too, even though they're not branded \"skeptic\" or \"rationality\".\n\nI've read a bit, but mostly I just came late enough to the scene and found Eliezer and Scott quickly enough that I didn't get the chance to read them deeply before then, and after I did I didn't feel the need.\n\nYep, and Paul Graham is also someone Eliezer respects a lot, and I think might have even been mentioned in the sequences. I guess you could add various sci-fi authors to the list.\n\nPersonally, I feel the whole thing started with Socrates. However, by the time I got around to cracking open *The Apology*, I felt like I had already internalized his ideas.\n\nBut I don't get that impression when I hang out with Rationalists. The median reader of *Rationality: A-Z* shatters under Socratic dialogue.\n\nI agree, though if we're trying to cut the history of rationality in periods/levels, then Socrates is a different (the first) period/level (Though there's a sense in which he's been at a higher level than many who came after him).\n\nI think Socrates' brilliance came from realizing how little capacity to know they had at the time, and fully developing the skill of not fooling himself. What others did after him was develop mostly the capacity to know, while mostly not paying as much attention to not fooling themselves.\n\nI think the \"Skeptics\" got on this journey of thinking better and recognizing errors, but were almost completely focused on finding them in others. With Yudkowsky the focus shifted inward in a very Socratic manner, to find your own faults and limitations.\n\nTangent about Trolling as a core rationality skill\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nI've never heard the word \"Socratic\" used in that way. I like it.\n\nAnother similarity Yudkowsky has to Socrates is that they're both notorious trolls.\n\nThat made me laugh. It's true. I remember stories from the Sequences of Dialogues he had with people who he basically trolled.\n\nAnd there's a good reason for it. Trolling your students is absolutely necessary when teaching rationality. I troll my students/friends all the time. When I visited the Lightcone offices in Berkeley, I trolled them too.\n\nAh, I see that [you have written about this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exvuvFZniGh2R5nvd/the-mountain-troll).\n\nDo you know why trolling is so important?\n\nI'm not sure I understand exactly how you use the concept, so tell me why you think It's so important.\n\nI could explain this in simple words. But I think it would be more fun and more educational if I trolled you instead. Are you okay with that?\n\nHaha, sure :) \n\nYou've convinced me. Trolling is unethical. Rationalist teachers shouldn't do it. Let's move on.\n\nlol, I didn't say anything so I couldn't have convinced you of anything :)\n\nPerhaps you've convinced yourself, but I bet you haven't and you're just trolling :)\n\n(:\n\nA rationalist must be skeptical of authority. Suppose you are a teacher of rationality, and therefore an authority figure. How do you ethically teach your students to be skeptical of you?\n\nAs an educator I do think about that a lot. On the one hand I want to tell the students everything I know that would be useful for them to know too, on the other hand I want to account for the possibility that I'm wrong, so I need to develop their ability to scrutinize what I say and check if it's actually true. \n\nSo some teachers solve this by sacrificing either the first or the second part, because doing both of them well is harder, and that's unfortunate.\n\nWhen I was in school I had a teacher who was very good at combining these. She'd start a topic by giving us a passionate speech, which made us care and told us what she believes, but then she made us dig into the subject and read various reports and come to our own conclusions. And it worked, many students *did* come to different conclusions.\n\nI also think back to ['My Favorite Liar'](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/my-favorite-liahtml), where a teacher planted a falsehood in every lecture and told the students about it, so they would scrutinize his lectures to find the intentional error, but in the process also doubt and scrutinize everything else. And I guess you can call that a kind of trolling.\n\nGood. Very good!\n\nThat is indeed a kind of trolling. After all, when a teacher is about to deceive you, she/he always lets you know in advance that you are about to encounter misinformation. That's how you know when you need to be skeptical.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nI think so. I suggested to specify \"**intentionally** deceive you\" and you rejected that. And I thought, but how can he let you know he's going to deceive you if he's not doing so intentionally? But since he might deceive you unintentionally all the time, then he has to let you know in advance that you might be deceived and should be skeptical. Is that the idea?\n\n\\[Note to readers: There's a feature in the LessWrong dialogue interface where Yoav can suggest a change to what I wrote. Yoav did so. I rejected the change.\\]\n\nThat is the idea.\n\nBack to \"What's the next level of rationality?\"\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nGetting back to our original question, \"What's the next level of rationality? \\[after Eliezer\\]\", one of the (many) things he didn't get around to writing about is how important it is for rationalists to troll each other.\n\nFeynman was a troll too, by the way.\n\nAbsolutely, even more so than Eliezer, I think. \"[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You're_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!)\" is one of the funniest books I've read.\n\nIt's hilarious.\n\nBesides the importance of trolling, what are some other facets of rationality that Eliezer never got around to writing about?\n\nWell, I think the best place to start with is the [preface](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uXn3LyA8eNqpvdoZw/preface) Eliezer wrote in 2015 to 'Rationality: A-Z\", where he lists 5 overarching errors he made in the sequences:\n\n1.  Not writing with the intention of helping people do better in their everyday lives, instead of helping them solve big, difficult, important problems\n2.  Focusing too much on how to learn the theory and not enough on how to practice it. \n3.  Focusing too much on rational belief, too little on rational action.\n4.  Not organized the content in the sequences well (Things are much better now with the new sequences and the LW wiki)\n5.  Speaking plainly about the stupidity of what appeared to be stupid ideas, Instead of writing more courteously.\n\nI think the first 3 are relevant to our discussion.\n\nSome other points I'd add (some practical, some foundational/theoretical)\n\n1.  The sequences and most of LW thereafter focused mainly on how to be more rational as an individual, and not on how to collaborate as rationalists or be more rational as a pair or a group.\n2.  It overlooked the value of information in tradition. (things like the Lindy Principle, Chesterton's fence, etc)\n3.  Related, it overlooked how many things, like certain biases, may actually be rational when analyzed better or considering our limitations.\n4.  It's based on Bayesianism, which is a bit like General Relativity in that we know it's very much correct, but not *fully*, and there's *something* after it that should be even more correct than it. With Bayesianism the problem is that it assumes Logical Omniscience and observing the world from outside.\n5.  Most of the foundational problems pointed out in the sequences — anthropic reasoning, reflective reasoning, strange loop circularity — haven't been solved. And though these aren't very relevant in day-to-day life, because they either don't come up or we have an intuition for the answer, these sure would be nice to solve, and it would show that rationality has firm foundations, for those who care about such things.\n\nThese have all been addressed to some degree after the sequences were written, of course, so this is not new or anything, and many of these *are* in the \"water supply\" to a degree (especially the value of information in tradition).\n\nBut it shows that we have no rationalist canon that actually encompasses modern rationalist thought, which is something we would need to foster a new phase/level of rationality.\n\nThis is very helpful. You're pointing at topics I've wanted to write about, but have been unsure of how to approach. For example, I want to write a post about the benefits of hypocracy. (Most religious people are hypocrites. If you cure the hypocracy, some they may turn toward rationality, but others just end up as fundamentalist extremists.) It falls under your \"overlooked value of tradition\" umbrella.\n\nBut I think the most promising point might be \"how to collaborate as rationalists or be more rational as a pair or a group\". This wasn't so important when Eliezer was starting. After all, there was little community to coordinate. But I've been doing many Socratic dialogues, and often the first thing I have to do is teach my partner how to have a Socratic dialogue.\n\nThat connects to \"helping people do better in their everyday lives\" and \"\\[f\\]ocusing too much on how to learn the theory and not enough on how to practice it\" too. \n\nYes, it was one of the first things that I wanted to write about on LW (I have a draft on pair rationality from January 2020), but I didn't feel I have a lot to say about it and I didn't have anyone else in my personal life who's as interested in rationality as me (still don't), so I didn't have the opportunity to develop that part on my own.\n\nIt's pretty hard to develop the art of Socratic **di**alogue on your own. 😛😛\n\nI've got a lot to say about Socratic dialogues but, as you pointed out, my writing is often very difficult for people to interact with.\n\nI think the root problem is that when I'm writing for an abstract audience, I'm awful at guessing what readers will and won't understand. That's why I like these dialogues so much. I can just ask \"Do you understand?\"\n\nAnd it's working, I'm experiencing none of the difficulties I tend to experience with your writing.\n\nThen perhaps the next step of this rationality project is for you and me to do a Socratic dialogue about \"how to do a Socratic dialogue\".\n\nAlright, that sounds good. Let's pick it up from there [next time](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/fMiwdif9KRAHSYkGW/p/2HopZhHvJr9aDJjMg) :)\n\n(:\n\nSIDECHAT  \n  \nMe too! That was great!  \n  \nI really like that you advocated for continuing instead of just cutting away the trolling bit. Good choice.  \n  \n\\[Do I have your permission to post?\\]\n\nThis was a lot of fun! :)\n\nYeah, I was planning on bringing up Eliezer's Preface and the other point from the start, and I was like, wait, we didn't even get there! haha\n\nYep, we can publish :)",

      "markdown": "Is entropy objective or subjective?\n\nIn one sense subjective, if you believe in subjective probabilities. i.e. if we use Shannon's entropy formula, \\\\(-\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i\\\\) then the formula itself is objective, but Bayesians would have subjective probabilities \\\\(p_i\\\\), which might vary from person to person.\n\nOn the other hand, it does seem to be the case that there are ways in which entropy is very clearly objective. Like the entropy of a box of gas isn't going to vary from person to person, and it's not possible to avert the heat death of the universe by simply changing your subjective beliefs in such a way that entropy goes down.\n\nIt's a strange tension to have in your worldview, that entropy should be both subjective and somehow also not. I have this meme lying around somewhere, let me see if I can pull it up...\n\n\"The second law of thermodynamics from various perspectives\":\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/63e09285d28fc1e846b652ef735d28c7372f4a4839b0f859.png)\n\nAnyway, the joke is to ask what the second law of thermodynamics looks like for people in various states of knowledge. For us humans, there is much we don't know, we're surrounded gas (and other things) made from atoms bouncing around in ways we haven't observed. And entropy goes up all the time, whenever there is friction, or any other dissipative process. Then, Laplace's demon is a stand-in for what we'd call a \"logically omniscient being\". The demon isn't all-knowing, but it has infinite memory and computational power. Since the laws of physics are reversible, entropy never increases for such a being. Apparent increases in entropy for us mortals are just the result of probability distributions become too complicated and tangled up for us to track. And then \"God\" would be a stand in for true omniscience, that actually does know the position of every atom. For God, for whom everything is certain, entropy is 0. (The rest of the meme is just a comment on the fact that Conway's game of life is not reversible, left as exercise for the reader.)\n\nYou seem not to have fallen for my trick question. Often, the people I talk to assume that entropy is necessarily an objective quantity. After all, \\\\(S=\\textrm{entropy}\\\\) appears in thermodynamic equations like \\\\(dS=\\frac{\\partial Q}T\\\\). But what I find most interesting about your comment is the phrase \"if you believe in subjective probabilities\".\n\nAre probabilities subjective? Litany of Tarski.\n\n> If probabilities are subjective,  \n> I desire to believe that probabilities are subjective;  \n> If probabilities are not subjective,  \n> I desire to believe that probabilities are not subjective;  \n> Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.\n\nOkay, to me, the Litany of Tarski makes the most sense in the context of questions that are clearly empirical. Like whether or not sterile neutrinos are a thing or whatever. In this case, what do I expect to observe if probabilities are fundamentally subjective, or fundamentally objective? It's just not an empirical question.\n\nIn another way, though, I think that Tarski's litany provides an answer to the question. The rough outline of the answer, so as not to keep you in suspense, is that while probabilities can be subjective, the laws of probability, the rules governing how probability can be manipulated are immutable.\n\nProbabilities can be generalized from logic, where \"true\" becomes \"1\" and \"false\" becomes \"0\". So if we generalize the litany of Tarski to a probabilistic setting, we get something like:\n\nIf X happens, I wish to have assigned it probability 1.\n\nIf X does not happen, I wish to have assigned it probability 0.\n\nAnd if I assign a probability \\\\(p\\\\) in between, the score is \\\\(\\log p_i\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the actual outcome.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, this is actually a description of the loss function in machine learning algorithms that have to classify things into categories. Probabilities are subjective in the sense that different people might have different probability estimates for various events, but the log probability score itself is not up for grabs.\n\nWell stated. Are probabilities observable phenomena?\n\nThe probabilities I have in my head are encoded as ways my neurons are connected, and maybe neurotransmitter concentrations and that kind of thing. That's clearly observable in principle. Most people will flinch if you throw a ball at their head. Why did they flinch? Because they assigned a high probability to the ball striking them. So that's certainly an observable consequence of a probability.\n\nThe question is easy if we're talking about subjective probabilities. It's only if one wishes to have objective probabilities that the question of whether or not we can observe them becomes difficult.\n\nI think I asked that question wrong. Instead of \"observable phenomena\", I should have written \"material phenomena\".\n\nYou and I are both material reductionists The point I'm trying to elucidate isn't an attack on physical materialism. Rather, I'm trying to draw attention to a certain facet of the Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n\nI call this problem the [Belief-Value Uncertainty Principle](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rQCAn3ZzHKoZGdANd/the-case-for-frequentism-why-bayesian-probability-is#The_Belief_Value_Uncertainty_Principle). Biological neuron connections are a black box. They're non-interpretable. All we can observe are the inputs and the outputs. We can't observe beliefs or values directly.\n\nIf we knew inputs, outputs and values, then we could infer beliefs. If we knew inputs, outputs and beliefs, then we could infer values. But for every possible belief, there is a corresponding value that could match our observations. And for every corresponding value, there is a belief that could match our observations.\n\nYeah, it's kind of like if we're space aliens watching some Greek mathematicians doing geometry with straightedge and compass. They're drawing things that are approximately circles and triangles, but only approximately. The true reality is that they're working on paper and drawing in charcoal (or whatever was actually used?) and the lines have thickness and the circles aren't quite round and so zooming in you see all kinds of problems with how this system isn't perfectly imitating the mathematical ideal. And maybe one of the guys is being really sloppy in his work and just drawing freehand for everything. So there's a philosophical question of \"at what point are these not even circles anymore\"? And we could in a similar way ask: human neurons are just approximating probability, and some people are actually really bad at reasoning, but nobody is coming close to following the ideal mathematical laws of probability. At what point does this \"probability\" idea stop being a good description of how someone is thinking? What if it's not a good description for how literally anybody in the world is thinking?\n\nIn his book (which I haven't read all of), E.T. Jaynes made quite a good decision of how to present probability. He didn't introduce it as the science of how humans think. He presented it terms of \"let's suppose we were going to build an ideal reasoning robot. What would be the best way to design it?\"\n\nIndeed. Instead of human beings, let's consider an ideal reasoning robot with a legible world module inside its positronic brain.\n\nSomething interesting to me about such a being is that its potential world models and its potential value functions [are not orthogonal](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tFjoPbLGrvEvAL9TL/self-reference-breaks-the-orthogonality-thesis).\n\nNot to go in for a full-throated defence of the orthogonality thesis just yet, but looking at your article there, it seems like you're predicting that the world-model would have a tendency to try and manipulate the values/search parts of the agent. I don't see how that's necessarily true? Like if I imagine training a feed-forward neural network to make \"what comes next?\" predictions for a rules-based environment, then it seems like it just tries to get better and better at making those predictions. If I vary the difficulty of the predictions I ask it to make, how do we end up with that network attempting to manipulate me into giving it the easiest predictions?\n\nWhat kind of neural network? It it purely functional (as in \"functional programming\") or does it have a legible representation of the Universe? That is, is it stateful?\n\nBy the way, you don't need to defend the orthogonality thesis from all possible attacks. I'm just claiming that legible embedded world optimizers have at least one belief-value constraint. I'm not taking any other issues with the orthogonality thesis (in this dialogue).\n\nFor the world model, I'm imagining a feed-forward network, but GPT-4 is feed-forward, so it could still be quite sophisticated, with attention layers and that kind of thing. GPT-4 also gets a scratch pad when doing auto-regressive generation, so we can imagine that the world model could also get a scratch pad to work out intermediate states when making its predictions. The scratchpad is stateful, so I guess it in some sense has a stateful representation of the universe. Maybe not a legible one, though.\n\nCan we make it legible by defining a fixed function \\\\(F:\\textrm{scratchpad}\\to\\textrm{universe}\\\\) that legibly maps from the scratchpad to universe macrostates?\n\nI guess the problem I see with that idea would be that we have some limited number of macrostates, based on the size of our scratchpad. If the function \\\\(F\\\\) is fixed, then that kills a lot of flexibility. Like if we're talking about programming computers, and the function \\\\(F\\\\) coarse grains out details like the exact positions of electrons, then we're building an agent that can't see the point of programming. As far as it could tell, it's not changing the macrostate by rearranging all these electrons. Also, when humans program, we don't usually think of ourselves as rearranging electrons, though that is what we're in fact doing. We think in terms of this separate ontology of \"I'm writing a computer program\".\n\nSo in other words, we have various abstractions we use to navigate the universe, pulling on different ones at different times. If \\\\(F\\\\) could be a learned function instead of a fixed one, then we might be getting somewhere.\n\nIt doesn't matter to me whether \\\\(F\\\\) is a learned function, but it is important that \\\\(F\\\\) is fixed. (This will matter later.)\n\nI acknowledge that \\\\(F\\\\)'s mapping of single scratchpad states to infinite universe states creates an implicit fungibility between universe states that constraints what it's possible to express as a value function. If \\\\(F^{-1}\\\\) maps \"Lsusr eats breakfast\" and \"Lsusr doesn't eat breakfast\" to the same scratchpad state, then it's impossible to define a value function that causes me to eat breakfast. That's not where I think the orthogonality thesis breaks.\n\nOkay, interesting. Let's say the following then: The scratchpad consists of two sections: one holds the source code for the function \\\\(F\\\\) and the other holds some long string of binary data, \\\\(D\\\\). And then the statement is that \\\\(F\\\\) maps from microstates of the universe to some corresponding value of \\\\(D\\\\).\n\nI think this gets around the issue of flexibility, while still hopefully preserving the basic idea of having some legible mapping between states of the universe and the data in the scratchpad.\n\nIs \\\\(F\\\\)'s source code human-readable?\n\nWe might as well specify that it is, no?\n\nI guess what actually matters is that \\\\(F\\\\) is human-writable. Anyway…go on. :)\n\nOkay, so that's the world model handled. The robot should also presumably have some values that it pursues. Let's say we have some learned function \\\\(U\\\\) that assigns utilities to states of the universe. (We'll limit the possible functions \\\\(F\\\\) that we can use above to just those functions that preserve enough information that \\\\(U\\\\) can be inferred from \\\\(D\\\\).)\n\nSo anyway, we have this function \\\\(U\\\\) and then we'd like to search across actions \\\\(a\\\\) and functions \\\\(F\\\\). The query to the world model is: suppose we've taken the action \\\\(a\\\\), what is the expected value of \\\\(U\\\\)?\n\nWe can try different functions \\\\(F\\\\) (which determines the precision of the world model's predictions, some functions \\\\(F\\\\) will show programming as a potentially valuable strategy, and others won't, depending on whether or not \\\\(F\\\\) keeps track of electrons or not.) The agent picks the action with the highest expected utility across all choices of \\\\(F\\\\).\n\n(There's an issue of how the agent is to predict its own future actions. One simplifying assumption that I sometimes like to make in this kind of very abstract \"let's think of an agent design\" discussion is to suppose that the agent only needs to make a single (possibly very complex) decision in the entire history of the universe. The rationale is that the agent can decide in advance \"if A happens, then I'm going to do X\", and \"if B happens then I'm going to do Y\". So if we pack all those future potential observations and actions into single decision made right at the start. This works so long as we're very unconstrained in terms of compute (i.e. we have exponential amounts of compute).)\n\nIt sounds like \\\\(D\\\\) is a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)).\n\nThat depends on which choice of \\\\(F\\\\) we're working with. If it ignores the exact positions of electrons (or even just the positions of the electrons inside the robot), then it's not a quine. If \\\\(F\\\\) does map information about the inner workings of the bot into \\\\(D\\\\) then there would be at least some self reference. In an extreme case where \\\\(F\\\\)'s output is just the contents of the \\\\(D\\\\) data store, then that's quite a lot like a quine. Except that the contents of \\\\(D\\\\) change over time as the robot considers different actions and uses different functions \\\\(F\\\\) to try and analyze the world. The contents of \\\\(D\\\\) after the robot has already decided on an action are almost uninteresting, it's just whatever possibility the robot last searched.\n\nI guess it's not a perfect quine. The important thing is that \\\\(D\\\\) sometimes (especially for smart, powerful robots) must reference itself, without contradiction. There exist some functions \\\\(F\\\\) such that this self-reference imposes a constraint on \\\\(D\\\\).\n\nOkay, so if \\\\(F\\\\) takes the whole world-history (and predicted future) as input, then we can consider some particular recursive \\\\(F_r\\\\) that looks in particular at the robot's thoughts at the time when it was analyzing the universe using \\\\(F_r\\\\), and then it just dumps the data in finds in \\\\(D\\\\) to output. (We can also consider the paradoxical \\\\(F_r'\\\\), which inverts all the bits before dumping them. Which I guess means that the world model can't be powerful enough to model itself too well.)\n\nCorrect. When a world model becomes too powerful, it cannot model itself. If a powerful world model cannot model itself, then it cannot model the world. If a powerful world model cannot model the world…then the orthogonality thesis shatters under its own weight.",
      "plaintextDescription": "lsusr\nIs entropy objective or subjective?\n\nDaemonicSigil\nIn one sense subjective, if you believe in subjective probabilities. i.e. if we use Shannon's entropy formula, −∑ipilogpi then the formula itself is objective, but Bayesians would have subjective probabilities pi, which might vary from person to person.\n\nOn the other hand, it does seem to be the case that there are ways in which entropy is very clearly objective. Like the entropy of a box of gas isn't going to vary from person to person, and it's not possible to avert the heat death of the universe by simply changing your subjective beliefs in such a way that entropy goes down.\n\nIt's a strange tension to have in your worldview, that entropy should be both subjective and somehow also not. I have this meme lying around somewhere, let me see if I can pull it up...\n\n\"The second law of thermodynamics from various perspectives\":\n\nAnyway, the joke is to ask what the second law of thermodynamics looks like for people in various states of knowledge. For us humans, there is much we don't know, we're surrounded gas (and other things) made from atoms bouncing around in ways we haven't observed. And entropy goes up all the time, whenever there is friction, or any other dissipative process. Then, Laplace's demon is a stand-in for what we'd call a \"logically omniscient being\". The demon isn't all-knowing, but it has infinite memory and computational power. Since the laws of physics are reversible, entropy never increases for such a being. Apparent increases in entropy for us mortals are just the result of probability distributions become too complicated and tangled up for us to track. And then \"God\" would be a stand in for true omniscience, that actually does know the position of every atom. For God, for whom everything is certain, entropy is 0. (The rest of the meme is just a comment on the fact that Conway's game of life is not reversible, left as exercise for the reader.)\n\nlsusr\nYou seem not to have fallen for my trick qu",

This makes [password-guessing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NMoLJuDJEms7Ku9XS/guessing-the-teacher-s-password) impossible. He's playing chess, not *Jeopardy!*\n*   I avoid telling Noam what I believe, unless he asks explicitly. This is more fun for Noam, because nobody likes getting unsolicited preaching. It's more persuasive too, because the conclusions feel like they're his conclusions.\n*   I back off immediately when Noam changes the subject.\n\n**Noam:** I know you are against forgiveness of student loan debts. Can you tell me why? I am doing this for a speech and debate tournament.\n\n**Lsusr:** Didn't you [used to believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_wNNjfCG1E&t=4s) the pro relief arguments? Surely it is not difficult to repeat the arguments that once persuaded you.\n\n**Noam:** I don't know if I have enough research to debate someone like you right now.\n\n**Lsusr:** You're not trying to convince me. You're trying to convince [*them*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuaHRN7UhRo). Play to their biases, their irrationalities, their tribalism and their ignorance.\n\n**Noam:** I also have to appease the judges.\n\n**Lsusr:** That's what I said.\n\n* * *\n\n**Noam:** I'm struggling to find one good argument for student loan forgiveness.\n\n**Lsusr:** But didn't you used to endorse it? Surely you can repeat the bad arguments that once convinced you.\n\n**Noam:** Those were moral arguments without any economic understanding.\n\n**Lsusr:** That's fine. Your audience is probably economically illiterate.\n\n**Noam:** Somehow I think we won once as the side in affirmative for forgiving all student loan debts.\n\n**Lsusr:** Well done.\n\n**Noam:** Thank you.\n\n* * *\n\n**Lsusr:** Have you ever heard of \"effective altruism\". You might like some of the stuff they put out. It tends to be both morally coherent and economically literate (unlike the major Democratic, Republican, socialist, etc. political platforms).\n\n**Noam:** No, but I will look into it.\n\n**Lsusr:** You might not agree with it. But I predict its intellectual robustness would be refreshing to you.\n\n* * *\n\n**Noam:** Wouldn't that imply it would be moral for me to kill myself and then donate all my organs to people who need them? Unless I could save more lives without killing myself, I guess. Maybe a better argument would be to kill myself, have someone sell all my body parts, and then use the money to buy malaria nets to give to people living in Africa.\n\n**Lsusr:** You can save more lives without killing yourself. Also, I can't think of a single EA who has committed suicide for the cause.\n\n**Noam:** Probably because there is something that we find intuitively wrong about killing ourselves.\n\n**Lsusr:** Don't get distracted by the kidney thing. Here's the basic idea:\n\n*   It takes $10,000,000 for the US government to save an Amerian life.\n*   It takes $5,000 to save a life in Africa via public health measures.\n\nThat's why I donated $20 to public health measures in Africa last month. It does as much good as $40,000 spent by the US federal government.\n\n**Noam:** Yeah, that's true. Save a life from what in America?\n\n**Lsusr:** The basic idea is you should crunch the numbers.\n\n**Noam:** I think this works for money, but I don't know if it can be fully applied to everything.\n\n**Lsusr:** Why not? Concrete example.\n\n**Noam:** Well, it depends on if you think humans should have protected rights.\n\n**Lsusr:** That's not a concrete example. What is a real world decision your claim might apply to? Be specific.\n\n**Noam:** A doctor has 5 patients in need of organ transplant or else they will die. There is one perfectly healthy person who is under anesthesia due to a minor surgery. If we crunch the numbers, the doctor should kill that one guy to save five lives. If you think humans have rights, this would be immoral. If you think humans do not then it wouldn't be.\n\n**Lsusr:** Correct. That is obviously immoral. But human rights is not the only reason a doctor shouldn't murder his patients. Can you think of a utilitarian one?\n\n**Noam:** The doctor would lose their license and then they would be out of a job.\n\n**Lsusr:** What if there were no license requirements? Such as in a war zone.\n\n**Noam:** The patient may be able to save lives in the future.\n\n**Lsusr:** So could the 5 organ recipients. Another reason.\n\n**Noam:** I'm not sure.\n\n**Lsusr:** Nobody is going to go to a doctor they believe will murder them.\n\n**Noam:** If it is a war zone then there may not be another option.\n\n**Lsusr:** Fair. Are you familiar with the term \"deontological ethics\"?\n\n**Noam:** Yes. It's whatever has the best intention. Is that correct? I might have forgotten.\n\n**Lsusr:** Nope. It's not best intentions.\n\n**Noam:** Okay. What is it then?\n\n**Lsusr:** Deontological ethics is following good rules like \"don't kill your patients\". EAs believe in crunching the numbers, but they do not generally violate deontological restrictions. When I donated $20, I donated my own money. I didn't steal it.\n\n**Noam:** Okay. Let me think if there are any flaws that I see.\n\n**Lsusr:** Take your time.\n\n**Noam:** If you follow what I see to be good rules and you're helping the most amount of people, then I couldn't possibly object to it.\n\n**Lsusr:** That's EA. Not just people though. They have far more than their fair share of vegans.\n\n**Noam:** Okay. Slightly unrelated question: What is your thoughts on vegans?\n\n**Lsusr:** I haven't eaten meat in months.\n\n**Noam:** Is it an environmental thing for you or is it a moral objection to killing animals? Or health?\n\n**Lsusr:** The effect on my health is probably negative. The environmental impact matters little to me. I don't care about killing animals. If you can find an ethically-sourced hamburger, then I'd happily eat it. The problem is that our animal products, by default, come from factory farms, which are Hell on Earth. \\[Correction: I ate some gravy at my family's Thanksgiving dinner.\\]\n\n**Noam:** That is interesting to me and I don't necessarily disagree with your reasoning.\n\n**Lsusr:** I try not to impose my beliefs and values onto other people. Which is why I didn't mention this until you asked.\n\n**Noam:** Wouldn't killing animals also be immoral if you say that tormenting them is wrong?\n\n**Lsusr:** There is little suffering in an animal's clean death, especially compared to a long, good life. I'm trying to reduce suffering while adhering to deontological restrictions.\n\n**Noam:** Would you say that moral consideration should scale in importance with how advanced a thing is? Sorry if I am phrasing things poorly. It is late at night and I am waiting for my power to come back on so I can do the rest of my homework.\n\n**Lsusr:** I know what you mean. Answer = Yes. If I had to choose between saving two cows vs one person, the human is the obvious choice.\n\n**Noam:** Okay. I would agree with you.\n\n* * *\n\n**Lsusr:** How'd the debates go?\n\n**Noam:** You were very correct in your assumption that the judges would be economically illiterate.\n\n**Lsusr:** HAHAHAHAHA\n\n* * *\n\n**Lsusr:** Did you enjoy it? I feel like you'd enjoy debate tournaments a lot. Good job making it to competing with the varsity kids.\n\n**Noam:** Yes. It was quite fun.\n\n**Lsusr:** I liked high school debate too. I did it 3-4 years.\n\n**Noam:** It's fun trying to defend a wrong position because of how hard it is.\n\n**Lsusr:** What if your beliefs are wrong (so you think it's the right position)? Is it hard then?\n\n**Noam:** I know it is not on this one because―as you said―it is like debating if the sky is blue. But for some of the other ones like \"the USA should deploy more troops in <place>\", it is a bit harder to see what is right.\n\n**Lsusr:** Go outside. Look straight up. Tell me precisely what color you see.\n\n**Noam:** It's black at the moment.\n\n**Lsusr:** Usually, debate competition resolutions are (deliberately) so vaguely defined that they can be right or wrong, depending on how they are interpreted.\n\n**Noam:** From what I can see, this one is wrong no matter how you interpret it. I think the word \"all\" makes it almost impossible to defend.\n\n> The United States federal government should forgive all federal student loan debt.\n\n**Lsusr:** Suppose everyone in a democracy (wrongly) supports student loan forgiveness. Should the democratically-elected government respect the will of the people?\n\n**Noam:** Yes, because if they do not then it would set a dangerous precedent for disobeying the people.\n\n**Lsusr:** Then all you have to show is that a supermajority of the United States' voters support loan forgiveness.\n\n**Noam:** I would fear the implications of that more than the 3.4% inflation rate.\n\n**Lsusr:** Don't worry about it. A supermajority of US voters support far stupider policies. What inflation rate should the US have?\n\n**Noam:** My intuition says 0%, but there is some little economic thing that I am unaware of that says a country should have \\\\(x\\\\) amount of inflation.\n\n**Lsusr:** This is an hour-long YouTube video I made attempting to convey how complex the question is. \\[I'm the guy in the mask on the right.\\]\n\nWhy should it be zero?\n\n**Noam:** My gaps in economic knowledge are showing, I think, but isn't it good when a currency is worth as much as it can be? Also, my power is back on now. So I'm going to do homework and then go to sleep.\n\n**Lsusr:** If you want the currency to be worth as much as possible then we should have a negative inflation rate. Good night! Get lots of sleep.\n\n**Noam:** Oh, you're right. I blame that on \"2 am\".\n\n**Lsusr:** Nah. Your questions aren't stupid. This is just hard.\n\n**Noam:** I think I should remember numbers can go down.\n\n**Lsusr:** 🤑",

The underlying superintelligence won't kill everyone (intentionally or unintentionally), because it's not a world optimizer. The emulated human probably won't kill everyone by accident because that would require a massive power differential combined with malevolent intent. Another way humanity gets exterminated in this scenario is as the side effect of futuretech war, but since neither Yudkowsky nor Caplan consider this possibility likely I don't feel I need to explain why it's unlikely.\n\nInhuman world-optimizing agents are unlikely to turn the Universe into paperclips because that's not the most likely failure mode. A world-optimizing agents [must align its world model with reality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tFjoPbLGrvEvAL9TL/self-reference-breaks-the-orthogonality-thesis). Poorly-aligned world-optimizing agents instrumentally converge, not on siezing control of reality, but on the much easier task of *siezing competing pieces of their own mental infrastructure*. A misaligned world optimizer that seeks to minimize conflict between its sensory data and internal world model will just turn off its sensors.\n\nThese ideas are not very fleshed out.

The bet contains a clause to deal with interest rates going haywire and there's no way even a psychopathic machiavellian Yudkowsky would trash his public reputation for a mere CPI-adjusted $200. Moreover, accounting for interest rates is something [all time-displaced bets](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/nJzqnsZCfg2k4s2BP/p/r7PBDGWf9Jbdj4rnx) need to deal with. It's just an annoying fact of quantitative finance.\n\nThere's a bigger problem with the Caplan-Yudkowsky bet. The bet only makes sense from the perspective of Caplan. There's no direct way for Yudkowsky to intentionally profit from it except indirectly, via financial derivatives, unless our annihilation becomes certain.\n\nConsider the most conservative approach. Yudkowsky invests his $100 in the stock market at 5% annual interest for 13 years. There are two possible outcomes: Either the world ends or it doesn't. If the world ends, Yudkowsky gains exactly nothing from the bet, because he never spent the money. If the world doesn't end then Yudkowsky simply loses money. If Yudkowsky is to profit from the bet, then he must spend money before the world ends in 2030.\n\nSuppose it's 2029. Yudkowsky is confident that the world will end on January 1, 2030. There's no reason to preserve capital, so he blows all of his money on cocaine, prostitutes and a cryogenic vault. If the world ends, then great! But if the world doesn't end then Caplan doesn't get paid back. Yudkowsky can't spend the money as long as there is a chance the world will survive.\n\nIn other words, Yudkowsky can only benefit from the $100 by going bankrupt. (Unless interest rates change. Caplan notes that \"this is primarily a bet that annualized real interest rates stay below 5.5%\". Which is true. But what's interesting is the \"End-of-the-World\" part, not the 5.5% interest rate.)\n\nIt's plausible that financial derivatives might work around this problem, but unless Yudkowsky is using them (unlikely for a bet this small) then this bet was just an indirect way of buying a genuine probability estimate from Bryan Caplan. The only way Yudkowsky can earn money from this bet is via unintended edge cases where he survives the apocalypse (*e.g.* by being off-planet). Or where our doom has become certain, but it hasn't happened yet, and where money value is still meaningful.",
      "plaintextDescription": "Caplan and Yudkowsky bet at 1-1 odds whether humanity would be exterminated from the surface of the Earth by 2030.

The Orthogonality Thesis is usually defined as follows: \"the idea that the final goals and intelligence levels of artificial agents are independent of each other\". More careful people say \"mostly independent\" instead. Stuart Armstrong [qualifies](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AJ3aP8iWxr6NaKi6j/arguing-orthogonality-published-form) the above definition with \"(as long as these goals are of feasible complexity, and do not refer intrinsically to the agent’s intelligence)\".\n\nDoes such a small exception matter? Yes it does.\n\nThe exception is broader than Stuart Armstrong makes it sound. The Orthogonality Thesis does not just apply to any goal which refers to an agent's intelligence level. It refers to any goal which refers even to *a component of the agent's intelligence machinery*.\n\nIf you're training an AI to optimize an artificially constrained external reality like a game of chess or Minecraft then the Orthogonality Thesis applies in its strongest form. But the Orthogonality Thesis cannot ever apply in full to the physical world we live in.\n\nA world-optimizing value function is defined in terms of the physical world. If a world-optimizing AI is going to optimize the world according to a world-optimizing value function then the world-optimizing AI must understand the physical world it operates in. If a world-optimizing AI is real then it, itself, is part of the physical world. A powerful world-optimizing AI would be a very important component of the physical world, the kind that cannot be ignored. A powerful world-optimizing AI's world model must include a self-reference pointing at itself. Thus, a powerful world-optimizing AI is necessarily an exception to the Orthogonality Thesis.\n\nHow broad is this exception? What practical implications does this exception have?\n\nLet's do some engineering. A strategic world-optimizer has three components:\n- A robust, self-correcting, causal model of the Universe.\n- A value function which prioritizes some Universe states over other states.\n- A search function which uses the causal model and the value function to calculate select what action to take.\n\nNotice that there are two different optimizers working simultaneously. The strategic search function is the more obvious optimizer. But the model updater is an optimizer too. A world-optimizer can't just update the universe toward its explicit value function. It must also keep its model of the Universe up-to-date or it'll break.\n\nThese optimizers are optimizing toward separate goals. The causal model wants its model of the Universe to be the same as the actual Universe. The search function wants the Universe to be the same as its value function.\n\nYou might think the search function has full control of the situation. But the world model affects the universe indirectly. What the world model predicts affects the search function which affects the physical world. If the world model fails to account for its own causal effects then the world model will break and our whole AI will stop working.\n\nIt's actually the world model which mostly has control of the situation. The world model can control the search function by modifying what the search function observes. But the only way the search function can affect the world model is by modifying the physical world (wireheading itself).\n\nWhat this means is that the world model has an causal lever for controlling the physical world. If the world model is a superintelligence optimized for minimizing its error function, then the world model will hack the search function to eliminate its own prediction error by modifying the physical world to conform with the world model's incorrect predictions.\n\nIf your world model is too much smarter than your search function, then your world model will gaslight your search function. You can solve this by making your search function smarter. But if your search function is too much smarter than your world model, then your search function will physically wirehead your world model.\n\nUnless…you include \"don't break the world model\"[^1] as part of your explicit value function.\n\n[^1]: With some exceptions like, \"If I'm about to die then it doesn't matter that the world model will die with me.\"\n\nIf you want to keep the search function from wireheading the world model then you have to code \"don't break the world model\" into your value function. This is a general contradiction to the Orthogonality Thesis. A sufficiently powerful world-optimizing artificial intelligence must have a value function that preserves the integrity of its world model, because otherwise it'll just wirehead itself, instead of optimizing the world. This effect provides a smidgen of corrigibility; if the search function does corrupt its world model, then the whole system (world optimizer) breaks.\n\nDoes any of this matter? What implications could this recursive philosophy possibly have on the real world?\n\nIt means that if you want to insert a robust value into a world-optimizing AI then you don't put it in the value function. You sneak it into the world model, instead.\n\nWhat‽\n\n[Here's where you ask yourself whether this whole post is just me trolling you. Keep reading to find out.]\n\nA world model is a system that attempts to predict its signals in real time. If you want the system to maximize accuracy then your error function is just the difference between predicted signals and actual signals. But that's not quite good enough, because a smart system will respond by cutting off its input stimuli in *exactly* the same way a meditating yogi does. To prevent your world-optimizing AI from turning itself into a buddha, you need to reward it for seeking novel, surprising stimuli.\n\n…especially after a period of inaction or sensory deprivation.\n\n…which is why food tastes so good and images look so beautiful after meditating.\n\nIf you want your world model to modify the world too, you can force your world model to predict the outcomes you want, and then your world model will gaslight your search function into making them happen.\n\nEspecially if you deliberately design your world model to be smarter than your search function. That way, your world model can mostly[^2] predict the results of the search function.\n\n[^2]: The world model can't entirely predict the results of the search function, because the search function's results partly depend on the world model—and it's impossible (in general) for the world model to predict its own outputs, because that's not how the arrow of time works.\n\nWhich is why [we have a bias toward thinking we're better people than we actually are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority). At least, I do. It's neither a bug nor a feature. It's how evolution motivates us to be better people.",
