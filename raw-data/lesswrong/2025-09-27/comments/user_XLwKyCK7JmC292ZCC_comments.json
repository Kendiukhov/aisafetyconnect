Despite this work, it will most likely contain enough flaws that we will be at least somewhat embarrassed at having written at least parts of it and yet at some point a post has to go out into world to fend for itself.\n\nThere's no guarantee that this post will have the kind of impact that we deeply wish for, or even any achieve anything at all...

The AI safety community has spend nearly two and a half decades trying to convince people to take AI risks seriously. Whilst there have been [significant](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023) [successes](https://safe.ai/work/statement-on-ai-risk), these have also [fallen short](https://www.transformernews.ai/p/paris-ai-summit-failure)[^54slr2rt88c]. Undoubtedly this is incredibly naive[^gvunovlt2mc], but perhaps passion and authenticity[^0e7h2m5mcwxf] can succeed where arguments and logic have failed ✨🌠. \n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/284f638b19003945147effcd861ebeb2b3207bc7612029bb.png)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/13b6a7f3dfe6980a617b42d696c1a7cc15168b8840e220bf.png)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/284f638b19003945147effcd861ebeb2b3207bc7612029bb.png)\n\n**Acknowledgements:**\n---------------------\n\nThe initial draft of this post was produced during the [10th edition of AI Safety Camp](https://www.aisafety.camp/#h.4tl51mi26u2m).

Now that** ~**you've wasted my time**~ **I've done this, perhaps you could clarify how you think about wisdom? ✅🙏**\n\n*Sure. I've written at the top of this post* ⬆️ *why I often try to dodge this question initially. But given that you've made it this far, I'll share some thoughts. Just don't over-update on my views* 😂.\n\nGiven how rapidly AI is developing, I suspect that we're unlikely to resolve the millennia-long philosophical debate about the true nature of wisdom before AGI is built. Therefore, I suggest that we instead sidestep this question by identifying specific capabilities related to wisdom that might useful for steering the world in a positive direction.\n\nI'd suggest that examples might include: the ability to make wise strategic decisions, non-manipulation persuasion and the ability to find win-wins. I'll try to write up a longer list in the future.\n\nSome of these capabilities will be more or less useful for steering the world in positive directions. On the other hand, negative externalities such as accelerating timelines or enabling malicious actors.\n\nMy goal is to figure out which capabilities to prioritise by balancing the benefits against the costs and then incorporating feasibility.\n\nIt may be the case that some people decide that wisdom requires different capabilities than those I end up deciding are important. As long as they pick a capability that isn't net-negative, I don't see that as bad. In fact, I see different people pursuing different understandings of wisdom as adding robustness to different world models.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ ** If wisdom ultimately breaks down into specific capabilities, why not simply talk about these capabilities and avoid using a vague concept like wisdom? 🙅‍♂️🌐**\n\nSo the question is: \"Why do I want to break wisdom down into separate capabilities instead of choosing a unitary definition of wisdom and attempting to train that into an AI system?\"\n\nFirstly, I think the chance of us being able to steer the world towards a positive direction is much higher if we're able to combine multiple capabilities together, so it makes sense to have a handle for the broader project, in addition to handles for individual sub-projects. I believe that techniques designed for one capability will often carry over to other capabilities, as will the challenges, and having a larger handle makes it easier to make these connections. I also think there's a chance that these capabilities amplify each other (as per the final few paragraphs of  [`Imagining and Building Wise Machines`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02478)[^crtqmhn7yak] by Johnson, Bengio, Grossmann, et al).  \n  \nSecondly, I believe we should be aiming to increase both human wisdom and AI wisdom simultaneously. In particular, I believe it's important to increase the wisdom of folks creating AI systems and that this will then prove useful for a wide variety of specific capabilities that we might wish to train.  \n  \nFinally, I'm interested in investigating this frame as part of a more ambitious plan to solve alignment on a principled level. Instead of limiting the win condition to building an AI that always (competently) acts in line with human values, the wise AI Advisors frame broadens it such that the AI only needs to inspire humans to make the right decision. It's hard to know in advance whether this reframing will be any easier, but even if it doesn't help, I have a strong intuition that understanding why it doesn't help would shed light on the barriers to solving the core alignment problem.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Weren't you focused on wise AI advisors via Imitation Learning before? 🎯**\n\nYep, I was focused on it before. I now see that goal as overly narrow. The goal is to produce wise AI Advisors via any means. I think that [Imitation Learning is underrated](https://aiimpacts.org/an-overview-of-obvious-approaches-to-training-wise-ai-advisors/), but there are lots of other approaches that are worth exploring as well.\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n### **✋ Objections **\n\n+++ **Isn't this argument a bit pessimistic? 🙅‍♂️⚖️. I prefer to be optimistic. 👌**\n\nOptimism isn't about burying your head in the sand and ignoring the massive challenges facing us. That's denialism. Optimism is about rolling up your sleeves and doing what needs to be done.\n\nThe nice thing about this proposal from an optimistic standpoint is that, assuming there is a way for AI to go well for humanity, then it seems natural to expect that there is some way to leverage AI to help us find it[^k76ez251czp].\n\nAdditionally, the argument for developing wise AI advisors isn't in any way contingent on a pessimistic view of the world. Even if you think AI is likely to go well by default, wise AI advisors could still be of great assistance for making things go even better. For example, facilitating negotiations between powers, navigating the safety-openness tradeoff and minimising any transitional issues.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **But I don't think timelines are short. They could be long. Like more than a decade. 👌🤷‍♂️**\n\nShort timelines add force to the argument I've made above, but they aren't at all a necessary component[^04xxgeaaee8g].\n\nEven if AI will be developed over decades rather than years, there's still enough different challenges and key decisions that unaugmented human wisdom is unlikely to be sufficient.\n\nIn fact, my proposal might even work better over long timelines, as it provides more time for AI advisers to help steer the world in a positive direction[^2bv3miwbtfv].\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Don't companies have a commercial incentive to train wise AI by default? 🤏**\n\nI'm extremely worried about the incentives created by a general chatbot product. The average user is low-context and this creates an incentive towards [sychophancy](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/) 🤥.  \n  \nI believe that a product aimed at providing advice for critically important decisions would provide better incentives, even it were created by the same company.\n\nFurthermore, given the potential for short timelines, it seems extremely risky 🎰 to rely purely on the profit motive, especially since there is a much stronger profit motive to pursue capabilities 💰💰💰. A few months' delay could easily mean that a wise AI advisor isn't available for a crucial decision 🚌💨. Humanity has probably already missed having such advisors available to assist us during a number of key decision points 😭.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Won't this just be used by malicious actors? Doesn't this just accelerate capabilities? 🤔❌**\n\nI expect both the benefits and the externalities to vary hugely by capability. I expect some to be positive, some to be negative and some to be extremely hard to determine. More work is required to figure out which capabilities are best from a [differential technology development](https://michaelnotebook.com/dtd/) perspective.\n\n*I understand that this answer might be frustrating, but I think it's worth sharing these ideas even though i haven't yet had time to run this analysis. I have a * [`list of projects`](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/24RvfBgyt72XzfEYS/potentially-useful-projects-in-wise-ai) *that I hope will prove fairly robust, despite all the uncertainty.*\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Is there value in wisdom given that wisdom is often illegible and this makes it non-verifiable? ✔️💯**\n\nOscar Delany makes this argument in  [`Tentatively against making AIs 'wise'`](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tuAnrhy2BExGkwTKE/tentatively-against-making-ais-wise) (runner up in the  [`AI Impact Essay Competition`](https://blog.aiimpacts.org/p/winners-of-the-essay-competition) ).\n\nThis will depend on your definition of wisdom.\n\nI admit that this tends to be a problem with how I tend to conceive of wisdom, however I will note that  [`Imagining and Building Wise Machines`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02478) ( [`summary`](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/euAMyQAQWTYyWZW8Z/summary-imagining-and-building-wise-machines-the-centrality) ) takes the opposite stance - the wisdom, conceived of as metacognition - can actually assist with explainability.\n\nBut let's assume that this is a problem. How much of a problem is it?\n\nI suspect that this varies significantly by actor. There's a reasonable argument that public institutions shouldn't be using such tools for reasons of justice. However, these arguments have much less force when it comes to private actors.\n\nEven for private actors, it makes sense to use more legible techniques as much as possible, but I don't think this will be sufficient for all decisions. In particular, I don't think objective reasoning is sufficient for navigating the key decisions facing society in the transition to advanced AI.\n\nBut I also want to push back against the non-verifiability. You can do things like run a pool of advisors and only take dramatic action if more than a certain proportion agree, plus you can do testing, even advanced things like [latent adversarial testing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mynHvr3ZnYDsk2tGH/latent-adversarial-training-lat-improves-the-representation). It's not as verifiable as we'd like, but it's not like we're completely helpless here.\n\nThere will also be ways to combine wise AI advisors with more legible systems.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **I'm mostly worried about inner alignment. Does this proposal address this? 🤞✔️**\n\nInner alignment is an extremely challenging issue. If only we had some... wise AI advisors to help us navigate this problem.\n\n\"But this doesn't solve the problem, this assumes that these advisors are aligned themselves\": Indeed, that is a concern. However, I suspect that the wise AI advisors approach has less exposure to these kinds of risks as it allows us to achieve certain goals at a lower base model capability level.\n\n• Firstly, wise people don't always have huge amounts of intellectual firepower. So I believe that we will be able to achieve a lot without necessarily using the most powerful models.  \n• Secondly, the approach of combined human-AI teams allows the humans to compensate for any weaknesses present in the AIs.\n\nIn summary, this approach might help in two ways: by reducing exposure and advising us on how to navigate the issue.\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/284f638b19003945147effcd861ebeb2b3207bc7612029bb.png)\n\n### **🌅 What makes this agenda so great?**\n\nThanks for asking 🥳.

Here's three more bonus points :\n\n*   🦋🌪️: **Even modest boosts in wisdom could be significant. Single decisions often shape the course of history**. Altering the right decision might be the difference between avoiding and experiencing a catastrophe. Similarly, there are individual actors who could dramatically change the strategic situation by deciding to start acting responsibly.\n*   🚧🌱: **Progress on the core part of the alignment problem seems to have stalled. They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again without success, so perhaps we should be looking for new framings?** The wisdom framing seems quite underexplored and potentially fruitful to me[^jp6d03wlda]. It's not at all obvious that we want our technology to be intelligent more than we want it to be wise[^kar5n6c7ooo]. Furthermore, considering how to steer the world using cybernetic systems involving both humans and AI provides a generalisation of the alignment problem. **Maybe neither of these frames will ultimately make sense**, but even if that's the case, I suspect that **understanding precisely why they aren't fruitful would be valuable**[^zf8veqike3c].\n*   🐦‍⬛🦉: Even if the most ambitious parts of this proposal fail on a concrete level, **training up a bunch of folks with both a deep understanding of the alignment problem** and wisdom seems pretty darn valuable. Even if we don't know exactly what these people might do, it **feels like a robustly useful skillset** for the community to be developing[^3ykcny8ifoz].\n\nI believe that this proposal is particularly promising because it has so many different plausible theories of change.

Is this viable? Is this useful?**\n\n+++ **☞ Do you have specific projects that might be useful? - ** [`**📚Main List**`](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/24RvfBgyt72XzfEYS/potentially-useful-projects-in-wise-ai) or expand for other lists\n\nYes, I created a list:  [`Potentially Useful Projects in Wise AI`](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/24RvfBgyt72XzfEYS/potentially-useful-projects-in-wise-ai) . It contains a variety of projects from ones that would be marginally helpful to incredibly ambitious moonshots.\n\n**What other project lists exist?**\n\nHere are some project lists (or larger resources containing a project list) for wise AI or related areas:\n\n•  [`AI Impacts Essay Competition`](https://blog.aiimpacts.org/p/essay-competition-on-the-automation#footnote-anchor-1-143374374) : Covers the automation of philosophy and wisdom.\n\n•  [`Fellowship on AI for Human Reasoning - Future of Life Foundation`](https://www.flf.org/fellowship) : AI tools for coordination and epistemics\n\n•  [`AI for Epistemics - Benjamin Todd`](https://80000hours.org/2024/05/project-idea-ai-for-epistemics/) \\- He writes: \"The ideal founding team would cover the bases of: (i) forecasting / decision-making expertise (ii) AI expertise (iii) product and entrepreneurial skills and (iv) knowledge of an initial user-type. Though bear in mind that if you have a gap in one of these areas now, you could probably fill it within a year\" and then provides a list of projects.\n\n•  [`Project ideas: Epistemics - Forethought`](https://www.forethought.org/research/project-ideas-epistemics) \\- focuses on improving epistemics in general, not just AI solutions.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Do you have any advice for creating a startup in this space? - ** [`**📚Resources**`](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/ai-safety-and-entrepreneurship)\n\nSee  the  [`AI Safety & Entrepreneurship wiki page`](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/ai-safety-and-entrepreneurship) for resources including articles, incubation programs, fiscal sponsorship and funding.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Is it really useful to make AI incrementally wiser? ✔️💯**\n\nAI being incrementally wiser might still be the difference between making a correct or incorrect decision at a key point.\n\nOften several incremental improvements stack on top of each other, leading to a major advance.\n\nFurther, we can ask AI advisors to advise us on more ambitious projects to train wise AI. And the wiser our initial AI advisors are, the more likely this is to go well. That is, improvements that are initially incremental might be able to be leveraged to gain further improvements.\n\nIn the best case, this might kick off a (strong) [positive feedback cycle (aka wisdom explosion)](https://aiimpacts.org/some-preliminary-notes-on-the-promise-of-a-wisdom-explosion/).\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Sure, you can make incremental progress. But is it really possible to train an AI to be wise in any deep way? 🤞✔️🤷**\n\nPossibly 🤷.\n\nI'm not convinced it's harder than any of the other ambitious alignment agendas and we won't know how far we can go without giving it a serious effort. Is training an AI to be wise really harder than aligning it? If anything, it seems like a less stringent requirement.  \n  \nCompare:  \n• Ambitious mechanistic interpretability aims to perfectly understand how a neural network works at the level of individual weights  \n• Agent foundations attempting to truly understand what concepts like agency, optimisation, decisions are values are at a fundamental level  \n• Davidad's Open Agency architecture attempting train AI's that come with proof certificates that an AI has less than a certain probability of having unwanted side-effects\n\nIs it obvious that any of these are easier than training a truly wise AI advisor? I can't answer for you, but it isn't obvious to me.\n\nGiven the stakes, I think it is worth pursuing ambitious agendas anyway. Even if you think timelines are short, it's hard to justify holding a probability approaching 100%, so it makes sense for folk to be pursuing plans on different timelines.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **I understand your point about all ambitious alignment proposals being extremely challenging, but do you have any specific ideas for training AI to be deeply wise (even if speculative)? ✅**\n\n*This section provides a high-level overview of some of my more speculative ideas. Whilst these ideas are very far from fully developed, I nonetheless thought it was worthwhile sharing an early version of them. That said, I'm very much on the set of \"let a hundred flowers bloom\". Whilst I think the approach I propose is promising, I also think it's much more likely than not that someone else comes up with an even better idea.*\n\nI believe that imitation learning is greatly underrated. I have a strong intuition that using the standard ML approach for training wisdom will fail because of the traditional Goodhart's law reasons, except that it'll be worse because wisdom is such a fuzzy thing (Who the hell knows what wisdom really is?).\n\nI feel that training a deeply wise AI system requires an objective function that we can optimise hard on. This naturally draws me towards imitation learning. It has its flaws, but it certainly seems like we could optimise much harder on an imitation function than with attempting to train wisdom directly.\n\nNow, imitation learning is often thought of as weak and there's certainly some truth in this when we're just talking about an initial imitation model. However, this isn't a cap on the power of imitation learning, only a floor. There's nothing stopping us from training a bunch of such models and using amplification techniques such as debate, trees of agents or even [iterated distillation and amplification](https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616). I expect there to be many other such techniques for amplifying your initial imitation models.\n\nSee  [`An Overview of \"Obvious\" Approaches to Training Wise AI Advisors`](https://aiimpacts.org/an-overview-of-obvious-approaches-to-training-wise-ai-advisors/) for more information. This post was the first half of my entry into the AI Impacts Essay Competition on the Automation of Wisdom and Philosophy which [placed third](https://aiimpacts.org/an-overview-of-obvious-approaches-to-training-wise-ai-advisors/).\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Why mightn't I want to work on this?**\n\nI think it's important to consider whether you might not be the right person to make progress on this.\n\nI mean — wisdom? Who the hell knows what that is?\n\nI expect most people who try to gain traction on this to just end up confusing themselves and others. So, you probably shouldn't work on this unless you're a particularly good fit.\n\nOn the other hand, there are very strong selection effects where those who are fools think they are wise and those who are wise doubt their own wisdom.\n\nI wish I had a good answer here. All I can say is to avoid both arrogance and performative modesty when reflecting on this question.\n\n\n\n\n++++++ **Many of the methods you've proposed are non-embodied. Doesn't wisdom require embodiment? 🤔❌🤷**\n\nThere's a very simplistic version argument for this that [proves too much](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/G5eMM3Wp3hbCuKKPE/proving-too-much): people have used this claim to argue that LLMs were never going to be able to learn to reason, whilst o3 seems to have [conclusively disproven this](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough). So I don't think that the standard version of this argument works.  \n  \nIt's also worth noting that in robotics, there are examples of [zero-shot transfer to the real world](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kim2ec/jim_fan_says_nvidia_trained_humanoid_robots_to/). Even if wisdom isn't directly analogous, this suggests that large amounts of real-world experience might be less crucial than it appears at first glance.\n\nAll this said, I find it plausible that a more sophisticated version of this argument might post a greater challenge. Even if this were the case, I see no reason why we couldn't combine both embodied and non-embodied methods. So even if there was a more sophisticated version that ultimately turned out to be true, this still wouldn't demonstrated that research into non-embodied methods was pointless.\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/284f638b19003945147effcd861ebeb2b3207bc7612029bb.png)\n\n### **✍️ Conclusion:**\n\n**Coming soon 😉.**\n\n+++ **☞ Okay, you've convinced me now.

I don't think the argument in our paper is against it -it all depends on how humans will use the technology (and there are several papers on the role of metacognition for discerning when to rely on decision-aids/AI advisors, too).\"\n\n**AI Impacts Automation of Wisdom and Philosophy Competition **\n\n**Organised by:** Owen Cotton-Barrett  \n**Judges:** Andreas Stuhlmüller, Linh Chi Nguyen, Bradford Saad and David Manley[^bn3g0btbhcu]\n\n[` competition announcement `](https://blog.aiimpacts.org/p/essay-competition-on-the-automation)  [`Wise AI Wednesdays post`](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WBMcKgrTpmniTK8HG/untitled-draft-bgxq)  [`winners and judge's comments`](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hiuTzNBqG2EYg6qM5/winners-of-the-essay-competition-on-the-automation-of-wisdom)[^zjoz3gawj2p]\n\n> AI is likely to automate more and more categories of thinking with time.\n> \n> By default, the direction the world goes in will be a result of the choices people make, and these choices will be informed by the best thinking available to them. People systematically make better, wiser choices when they understand more about issues, and when they are advised by deep and wise thinking.\n> \n> Advanced AI will reshape the world, and create many new situations with potentially high-stakes decisions for people to make. To what degree people will understand these situations well enough to make wise choices remains to be seen. To some extent this will depend on how much good human thinking is devoted to these questions; but at some point it will probably depend crucially on how advanced, reliable, and widespread the automation of high-quality thinking about novel situations is[^orupv2e418s]\n\n**Beyond Artificial Intelligence (AI): Exploring Artificial Wisdom (AW)**  \n**Authors:** Dilip V Jest, Sarah A Graham, Tanya T Nguyen, Colin A Depp, Ellen E Lee, Ho-Cheol Kim\n\n[` paper `](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32583762/)\n\n> The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of technology that is best able to serve humanity and this will require advancements that go beyond the basic components of general intelligence. The term “intelligence” does not best represent the technological needs of advancing society, because intelligence alone does not guarantee well-being either for individuals or societies. It is not intelligence, but wisdom, that is associated with greater well-being, happiness, health, and perhaps even longevity of the individual and the society.

To be honest, that idea feels rather strange to me 🙃. I think it's important to primarily write for the benefit of your target audience and I don't think that the readers I care about most are just going to absorb the text wholesale, without applying any further skepticism or cognitive processing 🤔.

But that doesn't contradict my key point, that certain strategies may become viable if we \"go hard on\" producing wise AI advisors 🗺️🔓🌄. \n\n[^t1hzunqf8pq]: \"But \"reckless and unwise\" and \"responsible & wise\" aren't the only possible combinations!\" - True 👍, but they co-occur sufficiently often that I think this is okay for a high-level analysis 🤔🤞🙏. \n\n[^o18fnks9cyd]: They could also speed up the ability of malicious and \"reckless & unwise\" actors to engage in destructive actions, however I still think such advisors would most likely to improve the comparative situation since many defences and precautions can be put in place before they are needed 🤔🤞💪. \n\n[^s8y91xgk2j]: This argument is developed further in Some Preliminary Notes on the Promise of a Wisdom Explosion 🦉🎆📄. \n\n[^5g9p7o2gllf]: I agree it's highly unlikely that we could convince all the major labs to pursue a wisdom explosion instead of an intelligence explosion 🙇. Nonetheless, I don't think this renders the question irrelevant ☝️. Let's suppose (😴💭) it really were the case that the transition to AGI was would most likely go well if society had decided to pursue a wisdom explosion rather than an intelligence explosion ‼️. I don't know, but that seems like it'd be the kind of thing that would be pretty darn useful to know 🤷‍♂️. My experience with a lot of things is that it's a lot easier to find additional solutions than it is to find the first. In other words, solutions aren't just valuable for their potential to be implemented, but because of what they tell us about the shape of the problem 🗝️🚪🌎. \n\n[^jp6d03wlda]: How can we tell which framings are likely to be fruitful and ones are likely to be not 👩‍🦰🍎🐍🌳? This isn't an easy question, but my intuition is that a framing more likely to be worth pursuing if they lead to questions that feel like they should (❓) be being asked, but have been neglected due to unconscious framing effects 🙈🖼️. In contrast, a framing is less likely to be fruitful if it asks questions that seem interesting prima facie, but for which the best researchers within the existing paradigm have good answers for, even if most researchers do not 🏜️✨. \n\n[^kar5n6c7ooo]: I acknowledge that \"intelligence\" is only rather loosely connect with the capabilities AI systems have in practise. Factors like prestige, economic demand and tractability play a larger role in terms of what capabilities are developed than the name used to describe the area of research. Nonethless, I think it'd be hard to argue that the framing effect hasn't exterted any influence. So I think it is worthwhile understanding how this may have shaped the field and whether this influence has been for the best 🕵️🤔.  \n\n[^zf8veqike3c]: A common way that an incorrect paradigm can persist is if existing researchers don't have good answers to particular questions, but see them as unimportant 🙄👉. \n\n[^3ykcny8ifoz]: I have an intuition that it's much more valuable for the AI safety and governance community to be generating talent with a distinct skillset/strengths than to just be recruiting more folk like those we already have 🧩. As we attract more people with the same skillset we likely experience decreasing marginal returns due to the highest impact roles already being filled 🙅‍♂️📉. \n\n[^b39jysqn1r4]: That said, given how fast AI development is going, I'm hoping the process of concretisation can be significantly sped up. Fortunately, I think it'll be easier to do it this time as I've already seen what the process looked like for alignment 🔭🚀🤞.  \n\n[^juibjpdlbp]: First author 🥇. \n\n[^bn3g0btbhcu]: Wei Dai who was originally announced as a judge withdrew 🕳️. \n\n[^zjoz3gawj2p]: Including me 🏆🍀😊. \n\n[^orupv2e418s]: They write: \"The precise opinions expressed in this post should not be taken as institutional views of AI Impacts, but as approximate views of the competition organizers\" ☝️👌. \n\n[^6kkzb5xhbu]: Linking to this article does not constitute an endorsement of Sofiechan or any other views shared there. Unfortunately, I am not aware of other discussions of this concept 😭🤷, so I will keep this link in this post temporarily 🙏🔜.  \n\n[^aiqi80ztv7r]: You could even say: with the right person, and to the right degree, and at the right time, and for the right purpose, and in the right way ❤️🦉.",

It'll be posted as a full, proper Less Wrong/EA Forum/Alignment forum post, as opposed to just a short-form, when it's ready 🌱🌿🌳.\n\n ✉️ PM via LW profile   \n\n📲 QR Code\n\n\nThis post is a collaboration between Chris Leong (primary author) and Christopher Clay (editor), written in the voice of Chris Leong.\n\nWe have worked very hard on this[3] and we hope you find it to be of some use. Despite this work, it will most likely contain enough flaws that we will be at least somewhat embarrassed at having written at least parts of it and yet at some point a post has to go out into world to fend for itself.\n\nThere's no guarantee that this post will have the kind of impact that we deeply wish for, or even any achieve anything at all... And yet - regardless[4] - it is an honour to serve[5] especially at this dark hour when AGI looms on the horizon and doubt has begun to creep into the hearts of men[6] 🫡. The sheer scale of the problem feels overwhelming at times, and yet... we do what we can[7].\n\nThis post[8] doubles[9] as both as serious attempt to produce an original \"alignment proposal\"[10] and a passion project[11]. The AI safety community has spend nearly two and a half decades trying to convince people to take AI risks seriously. Whilst there have been significant successes, these have also fallen short[12]. Undoubtedly this is incredibly naive[13], but perhaps passion and authenticity[14] can succeed where arguments and logic have failed ✨🌠. \n\n\nAcknowledgements:\nThe initial draft of this post was produced during the 10th edition of AI Safety Camp.

Fueled by technological progress, our power has grown so great that for the first time in humanity’s long history, we have the capacity to destroy ourselves—severing our entire future and everything we could become.\n\nYet humanity’s wisdom has grown only falteringly, if at all, and lags dangerously behind. Humanity lacks the maturity, coordination and foresight necessary to avoid making mistakes from which we could never recover. As the gap between our power and our wisdom grows, our future is subject to an ever-increasing level of risk. This situation is unsustainable.

Sutskever felt that Altman was dishonest and causing chaos, which would be a problem for any CEO, but especially for one in charge of such potentially civilization-altering technology.”\n\n[**The Optimist, Keach Hagey**](https://www.openaifiles.org/the-optimist)\n\n> Ilya Sutskever, once widely regarded as perhaps the most brilliant mind at OpenAI, voted in his capacity as a board member last November to remove Sam Altman as CEO. The move was unsuccessful, in part because Sutskever reportedly bowed to pressure from his colleagues and reversed his vote. After those fateful events, Sutskever disappeared from OpenAI’s offices so noticeably that memes began circulating online asking what had happened to him. Finally, in May, Sutskever announced he had stepped down from the company.\n\n[**Time 100 AI 2024**](https://time.com/7012869/ilya-sutskever-2/)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/bf08a729b3a4d140beadde6ef54e1c79bea2df9cab291998.png)\n\n[**Twitter**](https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322)\n\n> We approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs.
