If the pause is government-mandated and happens late, I would prefer a 1-year pause with say Buck Shlegeris in charge over a 3-year pause with the average AI lab lead in charge.\n\nThe reason is that most of the safety research during the pause will be done by AIs. In a pause scenario where >50% of resources are temporarily dedicated to safety and >10x uplift is technically plausible, the speed of research is mainly limited by the level of AI we trust and our ability to understand the AI's findings. The world probably can't pause indefinitely, and it may not be desirable to do so. So what is the basic strategy for a finite AI pause?\n\n*   **Use superhuman AIs as that are smart as possible to do safety research, but not so capable that they're misaligned.** This may require avoiding use of latest gen models, or advancing capabilities and using the next gen only for safety.\n*   **Use an elaborate monitoring framework and incrementally apply the safety research generated** to increase the maximum capability level we can run at without being sabotaged when models are misaligned.\n*   **Prevent capability advances from being stolen**, so no rogue actor can break out and threaten DSA, forcing the pause to end.\n\nThe variance in AI speed will be huge as models get smarter and more efficient. Conditional on us needing a pause, I imagine that the situation will look something like: Agent-2 speeds up work by 10x and incurs 0.2%/year x-risk, Agent-3 has 20x speed and 1.0%/year x-risk, Agent-4 has 40x speed and 5.0%/year x-risk, and so on. This means there is huge value in **advancing capabilities in ways that that don’t reduce safety**. For example, maybe alignment-specific training data doubles speed while preserving alignment, or a new architecture gets most of the benefits of “neuralese” without compromising monitorability.\n\nI expect that in a pause, good vs bad management could make a >10x difference in rate of safety research progress, with some of this coming from targeting the appropriate risk level, some from better handling ambiguous evidence about safety of current models, and some from differentially advancing safe capabilities. In comparison, the amount of political will and diplomacy that will be required to make a pause 10x longer is immense.\n\nPause length is still valuable inasmuch as it gives more time for management to understand the situation, but is not the most important factor in whether the pause actually succeeds at solving alignment.",

But the crucial one is it's much more exciting to make something molecularly sharp.\n\nThe cost seems acceptable because it's still lower than most hobbies. I'm mostly concerned that the required PPE will ruin the experience as quite a lot is recommended: gloves, mask, eye protection, good ventilation, a tarp to catch stray obsidian shards.

      "markdown": "Will nuclear ICBMs in their current form be obsolete soon? Here's the argument:\n\n*   ICBMs' military utility is to make the cost of intercepting them totally impractical for three reasons:\n    *   Intercepting a reentry vehicle requires another missile with higher performance-- the rule of thumb is an interceptor needs 3x larger acceleration than the incoming missile. This means interceptors cost something like $5-70 million each depending on range\n    *   An ICBM has enough range to target basically anywhere, either counterforce (enemy missile silos) or countervalue (cities) targets, so to have the entire country be protected from nuclear attack the US would need to have millions of interceptors compared to the current ~50.\n    *   One missile can split into up to 5-15 MIRV (multiple independent reentry vehicles) which carry their own warheads, thereby making the cost to the defender 5-15x larger. There can also be up to ~100 decoys, but these mostly fall away during reentry.\n*   RVs are extremely fast (~7 km/s of which ~3 km/s is downward velocity) but their path is totally predictable once they enter the boost phase, so the problem of intercepting them basically reduces to predicting exactly where they'll be, then putting *something* ~100 g or larger in their path. The RV's own kinetic energy will completely destroy it.\n*   My understanding is that sensing had historically worked like this. The launch is first detected by primitive satellites, but there are too many decoys to tell which are the warheads and the resolution is poor. Interceptors thus require extremely high performance, meaning expensive systems like thrusters for moving sideways at tens of g at the last minute, radar, and cooling systems for IR cameras; including all the fuel the interceptor masses thousands of times what it needs to.\n*   Sensing is quickly being solved. One new generation of satellites (HBTSS) can track warheads after their booster burns out (at which point they become much dimmer), and advertises [\"weapons quality track for fire control\"](https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/missile-defense/hypersonic-and-ballistic-tracking-space-sensor-satellites) even for hypersonic glide vehicles, which are much harder to track than ICBMs. The first two were just launched last year, but it would not surprise me if hundreds will be operational soon: US has well over 1000 Starshield satellites in orbit, many equipped with radar and infrared cameras. Through SpaceX, they have the ability to launch tens of satellites per month if they needed to. China doesn't have the boost capacity of SpaceX but they would still be able to launch 1000 sensing satellites.\n*   The ultimate cost floor for intercepting ICBMs in the limit of perfect sensing is interceptor drones. Ukraine and Russia are in the middle of a war where most casualties are caused by drones, providing extremely high incentives to develop [interceptor drones](https://thedefender.media/uk/2025/07/tekhnari-developed-mungoose-interceptor/), which already have a top speed of 300 km/h, max altitude of 5 km, and basic infrared cameras at a unit cost of $1k-10k. The idea is the space-based sensors know the missile's velocity well enough to locate the target within 100 meters with 15 minutes of warning, the drones launch to a position 3 km in front of the target and are guided into exact position by radar and their own sensors as the RVs reenter, with sufficiently low error that they never need to go above their top speed or accelerate more than 1 gee.\n*   The other thing keeping ballistic missile defense from being practical during the Cold War was treaties like the ABM treaty, but today there are basically no active nuclear treaties between Russia, the US, and China.\n*   The internet seems to think it's still really hard to do missile defense against ICBMs. It seems like this was true in the Cold War but we can no longer be confident it's true today after 40 years of peace, with Boeing and American drone manufacturers vastly less competent than SpaceX and Ukraine's/Russia's. My guess at why the meme has persisted is that it is highly threatening and destabilizing to advertise one's ICBM defense capabilities. But many officials are talking openly about the predictability of ballistic missiles, and there is an arms race for other hypersonics for a reason.\n\nMy current guess is that the [SM-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIM-174_Standard_ERAM) and [PAC-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot#PAC-3_MSE) missiles either are already reliable or would be if the US had more practice, and if sufficient incentive exists, the cost of terminal ballistic missile defense will gradually decline as sensing improves, from the SM-6's $5M unit cost to lower and lower cost missiles like $400k AIM-9X until one could defend every city and silo in the US or China with a fleet of 100,000 interceptor drones. This would last until there are enough hypersonic glide vehicles and cruise missiles to reestablish deterrence (because they can outmaneuver cheap interceptors). But MIRVs would never return to their previous state of heavily cost advantaging the attacker, because Russia's [state of the art ICBMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-28_Sarmat) only claim to be able to carry 3 HGVs, vs 15 purely ballistic MIRVs. Also HGVs and HCMs are vulnerable in other ways.\n\nEdit: Another option pointed out by commenters is that ICBMs are retrofitted to carry reentry vehicles with limited maneuvering ability, which could happen faster.\n\nCurious to hear if I'm missing something major, as I'm by no means an expert here.",

Overall it looks like you've demonstrated this:\n\n*   They didn't commit obvious fraud (last digit test)\n*   If you remove all 14 of their control variables, this removes much of their statistical power, so the results are only marginally significant (p = 0.026981 overall, compare p < 0.01 in many independent categories in the original)\n*   If you remove all 14 of their control variables AND change from Poisson to negative binomial, the results are no longer significant. (However, if you include the control variables and use negative binomial the results are still significant: Web Table 12 in appendix)\n\nFurthermore you only examine all cause mortality, whereas the study examines deaths from specific diseases. Your replication will be less powered because even in non-high-income countries [most people die from things like heart disease and stroke](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death), reducing your power to detect even large changes in malaria or HIV deaths caused by USAID. Removing all 14 controls will kill your statistical power further, because the presence of things like \"adequate sanitation\" and \"health expenditure\" will definitely affect the mortality rate.\n\nFinally, in your conclusion, it makes no sense to say \"some of the choices they make to strengthen the result end up being counterproductive\"--this is weak evidence *against* p-hacking that to my mind cancels the weak evidence you found *for* p-hacking! This is super unvirtuous, don't just assume they were p-hacking and say your belief is confirmed when you found some weak evidence for and some weak evidence against.\n\nOff the top of my head, here are the results I'd want to see from someone skeptical of this study, in increasing order of effort. I agree these would be much easier if they shared their full data.\n\n*   Think about whether the causal story makes sense (is variance in USAID funding exogenous and random-ish?)\n*   Add year-based fixed effects\n*   Some kind of exploratory analysis to decide whether the negative binomial model is appropriate. I have never fit a negative binomial model but [here's what o3 suggests](https://chatgpt.com/share/68808bae-f73c-800a-8bbd-fe9f6ed02650)\n*   Use a Poisson model with robust standard errors\n*   Multiverse analysis where you pick 20 plausible control variables, control for 10 of them, and see how many are significant\n\n* * *\n\nNow some comments in no particular order:\n\nFirst thanks for including the equations, it makes the post a lot easier to understand.\n\n> when the world’s foremost medical journal publishes work indicating that a policy’s results will be comparable in death count to history’s [engineered mass-starvations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) by year’s end, I’m going to be skeptical.\n\nI'm as skeptical of this as any other study, but we should beware the absurdity heuristic and instead think about the actual claimed mechanism. There are LOTS more people in LMICs in the world today than in 1932 Ukraine and we *know* that millions die from preventable diseases per year; we also know that one of the main goals of USAID is to reduce deaths from preventable diseases, and that spending enough resources on preventable diseases can basically eliminate them.\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/b0fb5902d366c0f061e9c363e2151215d1b4d975c8bbbafa.png)\n\n> I’m going to be triply skeptical when similar Monte Carlo modeling has led to [inflated and incorrect death count prognostications in the past](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/05/08/so-the-real-scandal-is-why-did-anyone-ever-listen-to-this-guy/).\n\nThere are at least two reasons I don't think these cases are similar. \n\n*   The link you shared is about inherently harder modeling than this Lancet study. Ferguson's model models the exponential spread of transmissible diseases, which inherently has orders of magnitude wide confidence intervals in the final number of deaths, especially for median vs worst case scenarios. The only thing these studies share is they're using the extremely common technique of Monte Carlo modeling, and they're about disease.\n*   The prediction that 500k people would die without a lockdown in the UK, and 2M in the US, isn't too far off, given that even with partial lockdowns + vaccination 232k died in the UK and 1.19M in the US, plus there was limited information at the time\n\n> It’s way too much work for me to go find and recreate all of the 18(!) control variables they use.\n\nThey have 14 control variables not 18: 4 time based controls and 10 other controls.\n\n> The per year binning also torpedoes their results. \n\nThis is interesting, I'd like to see it with the full methodology\n\n> It looks a slightly better fit from a BIC perspective. The second quartile drops from significance and the third quartile is barely significant. Overall, this is still a much weaker result than what they report, but the binning itself doesn’t change a lot about the regression.\n\nNote their `**` means p < 0.05 and their `***` means p < 0.01, which is different from your annotations\n\n> The weird thing about this paper is its relation to Regression 1. In my reproduction that doesn’t have a gazillion controls, there is a significant relationship between per capita USAID spend and overall mortality. For whatever reason this wasn’t enough and some of the choices they make to strengthen the result end up being counterproductive. In both the categorical binning issue and the choice to use Poisson, the alternative choices make the results null, which I consider to be fairly strong evidence of p-hacking.\n\nMy understanding is that when you replaced their experiment with a simpler, much less powerful experiment, then did a cursory sensitivity analysis, the results were sometimes significant and sometimes not significant. This is totally expected. Also it makes no sense to say \"some of the choices they make to strengthen the result end up being counterproductive\"--this is weak evidence *against* p-hacking that to my mind cancels the weak evidence you found *for* p-hacking! This is super unvirtuous, don't just assume they were p-hacking and say your belief is confirmed when you found some weak evidence for and some weak evidence against.\n\nAlso, the results are significant in so many categories that I disagree with p-hacking being likely here. If you aggregated the results in some principled way, you would get some crazy low value like 10^-50, so it can't be a multiple comparisons issue. As for the controls, they seem plausible on priors (I'm not familiar enough to know if they're standard), and seem to improve the predictive power of the model.",
      "plaintextDescription": "I don't think the evidence provided substantiates the conclusions in this post. Overall it looks like you've demonstrated this:\n\n * They didn't commit obvious fraud (last digit test)\n * If you remove all 14 of their control variables, this removes much of their statistical power, so the results are only marginally significant (p = 0.026981 overall, compare p < 0.01 in many independent categories in the original)\n * If you remove all 14 of their control variables AND change from Poisson to negative binomial, the results are no longer significant. (However, if you include the control variables and use negative binomial the results are still significant: Web Table 12 in appendix)\n\nFurthermore you only examine all cause mortality, whereas the study examines deaths from specific diseases. Your replication will be less powered because even in non-high-income countries most people die from things like heart disease and stroke, reducing your power to detect even large changes in malaria or HIV deaths caused by USAID. Removing all 14 controls will kill your statistical power further, because the presence of things like \"adequate sanitation\" and \"health expenditure\" will definitely affect the mortality rate.\n\nFinally, in your conclusion, it makes no sense to say \"some of the choices they make to strengthen the result end up being counterproductive\"--this is weak evidence against p-hacking that to my mind cancels the weak evidence you found for p-hacking! This is super unvirtuous, don't just assume they were p-hacking and say your belief is confirmed when you found some weak evidence for and some weak evidence against.\n\nOff the top of my head, here are the results I'd want to see from someone skeptical of this study, in increasing order of effort. I agree these would be much easier if they shared their full data.\n\n * Think about whether the causal story makes sense (is variance in USAID funding exogenous and random-ish?)\n * Add year-based fixed effects\n * Some kind of explorat"

      "markdown": "Author here. When constructing this paper, we needed an interpretable metric (time horizon), but this is not very data-efficient. We basically made the fewest tasks we could to get acceptable error bars, because high-quality task creation from scratch is very expensive. (We already spent over $150k baselining tasks, and more on the bounty and baselining infra.) Therefore we should expect that restricting to only 32 of the 170 tasks in the paper makes the error bars much wider; it roughly increases the error bars by a factor of sqrt(170/32) = 2.3.\n\nNow if these tasks were log-uniformly distributed from 1 second to 16 hours, we would still be able to compare these results to the rest of our dataset, but it's worse than that: all fully_private tasks are too difficult for models before GPT-4, so removing SWAA requires restricting the x axis to the 2 years since GPT-4. This is 1/3 of our x axis range, so it makes error bars on the trendline slope 3 times larger. Combined with the previous effect the error bars become 6.9 times larger than the main paper! So the analysis in this post, although it uses higher-quality data, basically throws away all the statistical power of the paper. I wish I had 170 high-quality private tasks but there was simply not enough time to construct them.

      "plaintextDescription": "Author here. When constructing this paper, we needed an interpretable metric (time horizon), but this is not very data-efficient. We basically made the fewest tasks we could to get acceptable error bars, because high-quality task creation from scratch is very expensive. (We already spent over $150k baselining tasks, and more on the bounty and baselining infra.) Therefore we should expect that restricting to only 32 of the 170 tasks in the paper makes the error bars much wider; it roughly increases the error bars by a factor of sqrt(170/32) = 2.3.\n\nNow if these tasks were log-uniformly distributed from 1 second to 16 hours, we would still be able to compare these results to the rest of our dataset, but it's worse than that: all fully_private tasks are too difficult for models before GPT-4, so removing SWAA requires restricting the x axis to the 2 years since GPT-4. This is 1/3 of our x axis range, so it makes error bars on the trendline slope 3 times larger. Combined with the previous effect the error bars become 6.9 times larger than the main paper! So the analysis in this post, although it uses higher-quality data, basically throws away all the statistical power of the paper. I wish I had 170 high-quality private tasks but there was simply not enough time to construct them. Likewise, I wish we had baselines for all tasks, but sadly we will probably move to a different safety case framework before we get them.\n\nThough SWAA tasks have their own problems (eg many of them were written by Claude), they were developed in-house and are private, and it's unlikely that GPT-2 and GPT-3 would have a horizon like 10x different on a different benchmark.

We rectify this by constructing a suite of 193 realistic, diverse countries with territory sizes from 0.44 to 17 million km^2. Taking over most countries requires acting over a long time horizon, with the exception of France. Over the last 6 years, the land area that AI can successfully take over with 50% success rate has increased from 0 to 0 km^2, at the rate of 0 km^2 per year (95% CI 0.0-0.0 km^2/year); extrapolation suggests that AI world takeover is unlikely to occur in the near future. To address concerns about the narrowness of our distribution, we also study AI ability to take over small planets and asteroids, and find similar trends.\n\n**Measuring AI Ability to Worry About AI**\n\nAbstract: Since 2019, the amount of time LW has spent worrying about AI has doubled every seven months, and now constitutes the primary bottleneck to AI safety research. Automation of worrying would be transformative to the research landscape, but worrying includes several complex behaviors, ranging from simple fretting to concern, anxiety, perseveration, and existential dread, and so is difficult to measure. We benchmark the ability of frontier AIs to worry about common topics like disease, romantic rejection, and job security, and find that current frontier models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet already outperform top humans, especially in existential dread. If these results generalize to worrying about AI risk, AI systems will be capable of autonomously worrying about their own capabilities by the end of this year, allowing us to outsource all our AI concerns to the systems themselves.\n\n**Estimating Time Since The Singularity**\n\nEarly work on the time horizon paper used a hyperbolic fit, which predicted that AGI (AI with an infinite time horizon) was reached last Thursday. \\[1\\] We were skeptical at first because the R^2 was extremely low, but [recent analysis by Epoch](https://x.com/tamaybes/status/1902537990062342547) suggested that AI already outperformed humans at a 100-year time horizon by about 2016. We have no choice but to infer that the Singularity has already happened, and therefore the world around us is a simulation. We construct a Monte Carlo estimate over dates since the Singularity and simulator intentions, and find that the simulation will likely be turned off in the next three to six months.\n\n\\[1\\]: This is true",
