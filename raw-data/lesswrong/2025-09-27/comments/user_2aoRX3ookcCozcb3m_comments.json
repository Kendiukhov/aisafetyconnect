I'd mainly recommend telling your friends what you actually think, and using practice to get better at it.\n\nContext: One of the biggest bottlenecks on the world surviving, IMO, is the amount (and quality!) of society-wide discourse about ASI. As a consequence, I already thought one of the most useful things most people can do nowadays is to just raise the alarm with more people, and raise the bar on the quality of discourse about this topic. I'm treating the book as an important lever in that regard (and an important lever for other big bottlenecks, like informing the national security community in particular). Whether you have a large audience or just a network of friends you're talking to, this is how snowballs get started.\n\n If you're just looking for text you can quote to get people interested, I've been using:\n\n> **As the AI industry scrambles to build increasingly capable and general AI, two researchers speak out about a disaster on the horizon.**\n> \n> In 2023, hundreds of AI scientists and leaders in the field, including the three most cited living AI scientists, signed an [open letter](https://safe.ai/work/statement-on-ai-risk) warning that AI poses a serious risk of causing *human extinction*. Today, however, the AI race is only heating up. Tech CEOs are setting their sights on smarter-than-human AI. If they succeed, the world is radically unprepared for what comes next.\n> \n> In this book, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares explain the nature of the threat posed by smarter-than-human AI. In a conflict between humans and AI, a superintelligence would win, as easily as modern chess AIs crush the world's best humans at chess. The conflict would not be close, or even especially interesting.\n> \n> The world is racing to build something truly new under the sun. And if anyone builds it, everyone dies.\n\nStephen Fry's blurb from Nate's post above might also be helpful here:\n\n> The most important book I’ve read for years: I want to bring it to every political and corporate leader in the world and stand over them until they’ve read it. Yudkowsky and Soares, who have studied AI and its possible trajectories for decades, sound a loud trumpet call to humanity to awaken us as we sleepwalk into disaster. Their brilliant gift for analogy, metaphor and parable clarifies for the general reader the tangled complexities of AI engineering, cognition and neuroscience better than any book on the subject I’ve ever read, and I’ve waded through scores of them. We really must rub our eyes and wake the **** up!\n\nIf your friends are looking for additional social proof that this is a serious issue, you could cite things like the [Secretary-General of the United Nations](https://x.com/gcolbourn/status/1669104216307015680):\n\n> Alarm bells over the latest form of artificial intelligence, generative AI, are deafening. And they are loudest from the developers who designed it. These scientists and experts have called on the world to act, declaring AI an existential threat to humanity on par with the risk of nuclear war. We must take those warnings seriously.\n\n(This is me spitballing ideas; if a bunch of LWers take a crack at figuring out useful things to say, I expect at least some people to have better ideas.)\n\nYou could also try sending your friends an online AI risk explainer, e.g., MIRI's [The Problem](https://intelligence.org/the-problem/) or Ian Hogarth's [We Must Slow Down the Race to God-Like AI](https://www.ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2) (requires *Financial Times* access) or Gabriel Alfour's [Preventing Extinction from Superintelligence](https://cognition.cafe/p/preventing-extinction-from-superintelligence).",

As a consequence, I already thought one of the most useful things most people can do nowadays is to just raise the alarm with more people, and raise the bar on the quality of discourse about this topic. I'm treating the book as an important lever in that regard (and an important lever for other big bottlenecks, like informing the national security community in particular). Whether you have a large audience or just a network of friends you're talking to, this is how snowballs get started.\n\n If you're just looking for text you can quote to get people interested, I've been using:\n\n> As the AI industry scrambles to build increasingly capable and general AI, two researchers speak out about a disaster on the horizon.\n> \n> In 2023, hundreds of AI scientists and leaders in the field, including the three most cited living AI scientists, signed an open letter warning that AI poses a serious risk of causing human extinction. Today, however, the AI race is only heating up. Tech CEOs are setting their sights on smarter-than-human AI. If they succeed, the world is radically unprepared for what comes next.\n> \n> In this book, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares explain the nature of the threat posed by smarter-than-human AI. In a conflict between humans and AI, a superintelligence would win, as easily as modern chess AIs crush the world's best humans at chess. The conflict would not be close, or even especially interesting.\n> \n> The world is racing to build something truly new under the sun. And if anyone builds it, everyone dies.\n\nStephen Fry's blurb from Nate's post above might also be help"

EG[ my recent attempt](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AWoZBzxdm4DoGgiSj/ability-to-solve-long-horizon-tasks-correlates-with-wanting?commentId=wtuQasHREjgzxDcb4) to operationalize a bet with Nate went nowhere. Paul trying to get Eliezer to bet during the MIRI dialogues also went nowhere, or barely anywhere—I think they ended up making some random bet about how long an IMO challenge would take to be solved by AI. (feels pretty weak and unrelated to me. lame. but huge props to Paul for being so ready to bet, that made me take him a lot more seriously.)\n\nThis paragraph doesn't seem like an honest summary to me. Eliezer's position in the dialogue, as I understood it, was:\n\n*   The journey is a lot harder to predict than the destination. Cf. \"it's easier to use physics arguments to predict that humans will one day send a probe to the Moon, than it is to predict when this will happen or what the specific capabilities of rockets five years from now will be\". Eliezer isn't claiming to have secret insights about the detailed year-to-year or month-to-month changes in the field; if he thought that, he'd have been making those near-term tech predictions already back in 2010, 2015, or 2020 to show that he has this skill.\n*   From Eliezer's perspective, Paul *is* claiming to know a lot about the future trajectory of AI, and not just about the endpoints: Paul thinks progress will be relatively smooth and continuous, and thinks it will get increasingly smooth and continuous as time passes and more resources flow into the field. Eliezer, by contrast, expects the field to get *choppier* as time passes and we get closer to ASI.\n*   A way to bet on this, which Eliezer repeatedly proposed but wasn't able to get Paul to do very much, would be for Paul to list out a bunch of concrete predictions that Paul sees as \"yep, this is what smooth and continuous progress looks like\". Then, even though Eliezer doesn't necessarily have a concrete \"nope, the future will go like X instead of Y\" prediction, he'd be willing to bet against a *portfolio* of Paul-predictions: when you expect the future to be more unpredictable, you're willing to at least weakly bet against *any* sufficiently ambitious pool of concrete predictions.\n*   (Also, if Paul generated a ton of predictions like that, an occasional prediction might indeed make Eliezer go \"oh wait, I do have a strong prediction on that question in particular; I didn't realize this was one of our points of disagreement\". I don't think this is where most of the action is, but it's at least a nice side-effect of the person-who-thinks-this-tech-is-way-more-predictable spelling out predictions.)\n\nEliezer was *also* more interested in trying to reach mutual understanding of the views on offer, as opposed to *bet let's bet on things immediately never mind the world-views*. But insofar as Paul really wanted to have the bets conversation instead, Eliezer sunk an *awful* lot of time into trying to find operationalizations Paul and he could bet on, over many hours of conversation.\n\nIf your end-point take-away from that (*even after actual bets were in fact made, and tons of different high-level predictions were sketched out*) is \"wow how dare Eliezer be so unwilling to make bets on anything\", then I feel a lot less hope that world-models like Eliezer's (\"long-term outcome is more predictable than the detailed year-by-year tech pathway\") are going to be given a remotely fair hearing.\n\n(Also, in fairness to Paul, I'd say that he spent a bunch of time working with Eliezer to try to understand the basic methodologies and foundations for their perspectives on the world. I think both Eliezer and Paul did an admirable job going back and forth between the thing Paul wanted to focus on and the thing Eliezer wanted to focus on, letting us look at a bunch of different parts of the elephant. And I don't think it was *unhelpful* for Paul to try to identify operationalizations and bets, as part of the larger discussion; I just disagree with TurnTrout's summary of what happened.)",

The idea of superintelligent agents monomaniacally pursuing “dumb”-seeming goals may sound odd, but it follows from the observation of Bostrom and Yudkowsky \\[2014, chap. 7\\] that AI capabilities and goals are logically independent.1 Humans can fully comprehend that their “designer” (evolution) had a particular “goal” (reproduction) in mind for sex, without thereby feeling compelled to forsake contraception. Instilling one’s tastes or moral values into an heir isn’t impossible, but it also doesn’t happen automatically.\n\nI won't weigh in on how many LessWrong posts at the time were confused about where the core of the problem lies. But \"The Value Learning Problem\" was one of the seven core papers in which MIRI laid out [our first research agenda](https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/), so I don't think \"we're centrally worried about things that are capable enough to understand what we want, but that don't have the right goals\" was in any way hidden or treated as minor back in 2014-2015.\n\nI also wouldn't say \"MIRI predicted that NLP will largely fall years before AI can match e.g. the best human mathematicians, or the best scientists\", and if we saw a way to leverage that surprise to take a big bite out of the central problem, that would be a big positive update.\n\nI'd say:\n\n*   MIRI mostly just didn't make predictions about the exact path ML would take to get to superintelligence, and we've said we didn't expect this to be very predictable because \"the journey is harder to predict than the destination\". (Cf. \"it's easier to use physics arguments to predict that humans will one day send a probe to the Moon, than it is to predict when this will happen or what the specific capabilities of rockets five years from now will be\".)\n*   Back in 2016-2017, I think various people at MIRI updated to median timelines in the 2030-2040 range (after having had longer timelines before that), and our timelines haven't jumped around a ton since then (though they've gotten a little bit longer or shorter here and there).\n    *   So in some sense, qualitatively eyeballing the field, we don't feel surprised by \"the total amount of progress the field is exhibiting\", because it looked in 2017 like the field was just getting started, there was likely an enormous amount more you could do with 2017-style techniques (and variants on them) than had already been done, and there was likely to be a lot more money and talent flowing into the field in the coming years.\n    *   But \"the total amount of progress over the last 7 years doesn't seem that shocking\" is very different from \"we predicted what that progress would look like\". AFAIK we mostly didn't have strong guesses about that, though I think it's totally fine to say that the GPT series is *more* surprising to the circa-2017 MIRI than a lot of other paths would have been.\n    *   (Then again, we'd have expected *something* surprising to happen here, because it would be weird if our low-confidence visualizations of the mainline future just happened to line up with what happened. You can expect to be surprised a bunch without being able to guess where the surprises will come from; and in that situation, there's obviously less to be gained from putting out a bunch of predictions you don't particularly believe in.)\n*   Pre-deep-learning-revolution, we made early predictions like \"just throwing more compute at the problem without gaining deep new insights into intelligence is less likely to be the key thing that gets us there\", which was falsified. But that was a relatively high-level prediction; post-deep-learning-revolution we haven't claimed to know much about how advances are going to be sequenced.\n*   We *have* been quite interested in hearing from *others* about their advance prediction record: it's a lot easier to say \"I personally have no idea what the qualitative capabilities of GPT-2, GPT-3, etc. will be\" than to say \"... and no one else knows either\", and if someone has an amazing track record at guessing a lot of those qualitative capabilities, I'd be interested to hear about their further predictions. We're generally pessimistic that \"which of these specific systems will first unlock a specific qualitative capability?\" is particularly predictable, but this claim can be tested via people actually making those predictions.",

Convincing all stakeholders of high p(doom) such that they take decisive, coordinated action is wildly improbable (\"step 1: get everyone to agree with me\" is the foundation of many terrible plans and almost no good ones)\n> 2.

While Moore's law, algorithmic improvement, and chip design hum along at some level, even a little breakdown in international willpower to enforce a pause/stop can rapidly convert to catastrophe. Spending a lot of effort to get that consensus also has high opportunity cost in terms of steering institutions in the world where the effort fails (and it is very likely to fail). \\[...\\]\n\nThree high-level reasons I think Leopold's plan looks a lot less workable:\n\n1.  It requires major scientific breakthroughs to occur on a very short time horizon, including unknown breakthroughs that will manifest to solve problems we don't understand or know about today.\n2.  These breakthroughs need to come in a field that has not been particularly productive or fast in the past. (Indeed, forecasters have been surprised by how slowly safety/robustness/etc. have progressed in recent years, and simultaneously surprised by the breakneck speed of capabilities.)\n3.  It requires extremely precise and correct behavior by a giant government bureaucracy that includes many staff who *won't* be the best and brightest in the field — inevitably, many technical and nontechnical people in the bureaucracy will have wrong beliefs about AGI and about alignment.\n\nThe \"extremely precise and correct behavior\" part means that we're effectively hoping to be handed an excellent bureaucracy that will rapidly and competently solve a thirty-digit combination lock requiring the invention of multiple new fields and the solving of a variety of thorny and poorly-understood technical problems — in many cases, on Leopold's view, in a space of months or weeks. This seems... not like how the real world works.\n\nIt also separately requires that various guesses about the background empirical facts all pan out. Leopold can do literally everything right and get the USG fully on board and get the *USG* doing literally everything correctly by his lights — and then the plan ends up destroying the world rather than saving it because it just happened to turn out that ASI was a lot more compute-efficient to train than he expected, resulting in the USG being unable to monopolize the tech and unable to achieve a sufficiently long lead time.\n\nMy proposal doesn't require qualitatively *that* kind of success. It requires governments to coordinate on banning things. Plausibly, it requires governments to overreact to a weird, scary, and publicly controversial new tech to some degree, since it's unlikely that governments will *exactly* hit the target we want. This is not a particularly weird ask; governments ban things (and coordinate or copy-paste each other's laws) all the time, in far less dangerous and fraught areas than AGI. This is \"trying to get the international order to lean hard in a particular direction on a yes-or-no question where there's already a lot of energy behind choosing 'no'\", not \"solving a long list of hard science and engineering problems in a matter of months and getting a bureaucracy to output the correct long string of digits to nail down all the correct technical solutions and all the correct processes to find those solutions\".\n\nThe CCP's *current* appetite for AGI seems remarkably small, and I expect them to be more worried that an AGI race would leave them in the dust (and/or put their regime at risk, and/or put their lives at risk), than excited about the opportunity such a race provides. Governments around the world *currently*, to the best of my knowledge, are nowhere near advancing any frontiers in ML.\n\nFrom my perspective, Leopold is *imagining a future problem into being* (\"all of this changes\") and then trying to find a galaxy-brained incredibly complex and assumption-laden way to wriggle out of this imagined future dilemma, when the far easier and less risky path would be to *not have the world powers race in the first place*, have them recognize that this technology is lethally dangerous (something the USG chain of command, at least, would need to fully internalize on Leopold's plan too), and have them block private labs from sending us over the precipice (again, something Leopold assumes will happen) while *not* choosing to take on the risk of destroying themselves (nor permitting other world powers to unilaterally impose that risk).",

Alignment in geopolitics can be temporary or situational, and it almost never means that Russia cares about China as much as China cares about itself, or vice versa.\n\nAnd if we step back from the human realm, an engineered system can be \"aligned\" in contexts that have nothing to do with goal-oriented behavior, but are just about ensuring components are in the right place relative to each other.\n\nCf. the [history of the term \"AI alignment\"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sy4whuaczvLsn9PNc/ai-alignment-is-a-dangerously-overloaded-term?commentId=xkn5sSGwHbY4SyvRv). From my perspective, a big part of why MIRI coordinated with Stuart Russell to introduce the term \"AI alignment\" was that we wanted to switch away from \"Friendly AI\" to a term that sounded more neutral. \"Friendly AI research\" had always been intended to subsume the full technical problem of making powerful AI systems safe and aimable; but emphasizing \"Friendliness\" made it sound like the problem was purely about value loading, so a more generic and low-content word seemed desirable.\n\nBut Stuart Russell (and later Paul Christiano) had a different vision in mind for what they wanted \"alignment\" to be, and MIRI apparently failed to communicate and coordinate with Russell to avoid a namespace collision. So we ended up with a messy patchwork of different definitions.\n\nI've basically given up on trying to achieve uniformity on what \"AI alignment\" is; the best we can do, I think, is clarify whether we're talking about \"intent alignment\" vs. \"outcome alignment\" when the distinction matters.\n\nBut I do want to push back against those who think outcome alignment is just an unhelpful concept — on the contrary, if we didn't have a word for this idea I think it would be very important to invent one. \n\nIMO it matters more that we keep our eye on the ball (i.e., think about the actual outcomes we want and keep researchers' focus on how to achieve those outcomes) than that we define an extremely crisp, easily-packaged technical concept (that is at best a loose proxy for what we actually want). Especially now that ASI seems nearer at hand (so the need for this \"keep our eye on the ball\" skill is becoming less and less theoretical), and especially now that ASI disaster concerns have hit the mainstream (so the need to \"sell\" AI risk has diminished somewhat, and the need to direct research talent at the most important problems has increased).\n\nAnd I also want to push back against the idea that *a priori*, before we got stuck with the current terminology mess, it should have been obvious that \"alignment\" is about AI systems' goals and/or intentions, rather than about their behavior or overall designs. I think intent alignment took off because Stuart Russell and Paul Christiano advocated for that usage and encouraged others to use the term that way, not because this was the only option available to us.",

I didnt feel anything weird, I didnt feel my \"consciousness split into two\" or something.\n\nWhy do you assume that you wouldn't experience the copy's version of events?\n\nThe un-copied version of you experiences walking into the room, sitting there, hearing the scanner working, and hearing it stop; then that version of you experiences walking out. It seems like nothing special happened in this procedure; this version of you doesn't feel anything weird, and doesn't feel like their \"consciousness split into two\" or anything.\n\nThe copied version of you experiences walking into the room, sitting here, hearing the scanner working, and then an instantaneous experience of (let's say) feeling like you've been teleported into another room -- you're now inside the simulation. Assuming the simulation feels like a normal room, it could well seem like nothing special happened in this procedure -- it may feel like blinking and seeing the room suddenly change during the blink, while you yourself remain unchanged. This version of you doesn't necessarily feel anything weird either, and they don't feel like their \"consciousness split into two\" or anything.\n\nIt's a bit weird that there are two futures, here, but only one past -- that the first part of the story is the same for both versions of you. But so it goes; that just comes with the territory of copying people.\n\nIf you disagree with anything I've said above, what do you disagree with? And, again, what do you mean by saying you're \"pretty sure\" that you would experience the future of the non-copied version?\n\n> Namely, if I consider this procedure as an empirical experiment, from my first person perspective I dont get any new / unexpected observation compared to say just sitting in an ordinary room. Even if I were to go and find my copy, my experience would again be like meeting a different person which just happens to look like me and which claims to have similar memories  up to the point when I entered the copying room. There would be no way to verify or to view things from their first person perspective.\n\nSure. But is any of this Bayesian evidence against the view I've outlined above? What *would* it feel like, if the copy were another version of yourself? Would you expect that you *could* telepathically communicate with your copy and see things from both perspectives at once, if your copies were equally \"you\"? If so, why?\n\n> On the contrary, I would be wary to, say, kill myself or to be destroyed after the copying procedure, since no change will have occured to my first person perspective, and it would thus seem less likely that my \"experience\" would somehow survive because of my copy.\n\nShall we make a million copies and then take a vote? :)\n\nI agree that \"I made a non-destructive software copy of myself and then experienced the future of my physical self rather than the future of my digital copy\" is nonzero Bayesian evidence that physical brains have a Cartesian Soul that is responsible for the brain's phenomenal consciousness; the Cartesian Soul hypothesis does predict that data. But the prior probability of Cartesian Souls is low enough that I don't think it should matter.\n\nYou need some prior reason to believe in this Soul in the first place; the same as if you flipped a coin, it came up heads, and you said \"aha, this is perfectly predicted by the existence of an invisible leprechaun who wanted that coin to come up heads!\". Losing a coinflip isn't a surprising enough outcome to overcome the prior against invisible leprechauns.\n\n> and it would also force me to accept that even a copy where the \"circuit\" is made of water pipes and pumps, or gears and levers also have an actual, first person experience as \"me\", as long as the appropriate computations are being carried out.  \n\nWhy wouldn't it? What do you have against water pipes?",
      "plaintextDescription": "> My first issue with your post is that this initial ontological assumption is neither mentioned explicitly nor motivated. Nothing in your post can be used as proof of this initial assumption.\n\nThere are always going to be many different ways someone could object to a view. If you were a Christian, you'd perhaps be objecting that the existence of incorporeal God-given Souls is the real crux of the matter, and if I were intellectually honest I'd be devoting the first half of the post to arguing against the Christian Soul.\n\nRather than trying to anticipate these objections, I'd rather just hear them stated out loud by their proponents and then hash them out in the comments. This also makes the post less boring for the sorts of people who are most likely to be on LW: physicalists and their ilk.\n\n> Now, what would be the experience of getting copied, seen from a first-person, \"internal\", perspective?

We notice that there's no physical thingie that makes the Ghost more connected to one experience or the other; so rather than exorcising the Ghost entirely, we imagine that the Ghost is connected to *every* experience simultaneously.\n\nBut in fact there is no Ghost. There's just a bunch of experience-moments implemented in brain-moments.\n\nSome of those brain-moments resemble other brain-moments, either by coincidence or because of some (direct or indirect) causal link between the brain-moments. When we talk about Brain-1 \"anticipating\" or \"becoming\" a future brain-state Brain-2, we normally mean things like:\n\n*   There's a lawful physical connection between Brain-1 and Brain-2, such that the choices and experiences of Brain-1 influence the state of Brain-2 in a bunch of specific ways.\n*   Brain-2 retains ~all of the memories, personality traits, goals, etc. of Brain-1.\n*   If Brain-2 is a *direct* successor to Brain-1, then typically Brain-2 can remember a bunch of things about the experience Brain-1 was undergoing.\n\nThese are all fuzzy, high-level properties, which admit of edge cases. But I'm not seeing what's gained by therefore concluding \"I should anticipate *every* experience, even ones that have no causal connection to mine *and* no shared memories *and* no shared personality traits\". Tables are a fuzzy and high-level concept, but that doesn't mean that every object in existence is a table. It doesn't even mean that every object is slightly table-ish.

I was unduly selfish and self-centered, because my experiences seemed to me like they were the center of the universe; I abstractly and theoretically knew that other people have their own point of view, but that fact didn't really hit home for me. Then something happened, and I had a sudden realization that no, *it's all real*.\"\n\nIf so, then that seems totally fine to me. But I worry that the view in question might instead be something tacitly Cartesian, insofar as it's trying to say \"all experiences are *for me*\" \\-\\- something that doesn't make a lot of sense to say if there are two brain states on opposite sides of the universe with nothing in common and nothing connecting them, but that does make sense if there's a Ghost the experiences are all \"for\".",

And some other MIRI folks are much more optimistic than Nate, FWIW.\n\nMy own view is that I don't feel nervous leaning on \"we won't crack open alignment in time\" as a premise, and absent that premise I'd indeed be much less gung-ho about government intervention.\n\n> why put all your argumentative eggs in the \"alignment is hard\" basket? (If you're right, then policymakers can't tell that you're right.)\n\nThe short answer is \"we don't put all our eggs in the basket\" (e.g., Eliezer's TED talk and TIME article emphasize that alignment is an open problem, but they emphasize other things too, and they don't go into detail on exactly how hard Eliezer thinks the problem is), plus \"we very much want at least some eggs in that basket because it's true, it's honest, it's cruxy for us, etc.\" And it's easier for policymakers to acquire strong Bayesian evidence for \"the problem is currently unsolved\" and \"there's no consensus about how to solve it\" and \"most leaders in the field seem to think there's a serious chance we won't solve it in time\" than to acquire strong Bayesian evidence for \"we're very likely generations away from solving alignment\", so the difficulty of communicating the latter isn't a strong reason to de-emphasize all the former points.\n\nThe longer answer is a lot more complicated. We're still figuring out how best to communicate our views to different audiences, and \"it's hard for policymakers to evaluate all the local arguments or know whether Yann LeCun is making more sense than Yoshua Bengio\" is a serious constraint. If there's a *specific* argument (or e.g. a specific three arguments) you think we should be emphasizing alongside \"alignment is unsolved and looks hard\", I'd be interested to hear your suggestion and your reasoning.

      "markdown": "From briefly talking to Eliezer about this the other day, I think the story from MIRI's perspective is more like:\n\n*   Back in 2001, we [defined](https://intelligence.org/files/CFAI.pdf) \"Friendly AI\" as \"The field of study concerned with the production of human-benefiting, non-human-harming actions in Artificial Intelligence systems that have advanced to the point of making real-world plans in pursuit of goals.\"\n\nWe could have defined the goal more narrowly or generically than that, but that just seemed like an invitation to take your eye off the ball: if we aren't going to think about the question of how to get good long-run outcomes from powerful AI systems, who will?\n\nAnd many of the technical and philosophical problems seemed particular to CEV, which seemed like an obvious sort of solution to shoot for: just find some way to leverage the AI's intelligence to solve the problem of extrapolating everyone's preferences in a reasonable way, and of aggregating those preferences fairly.\n\n*   Come 2014, Stuart Russell and MIRI were both looking for a new term to replace \"the Friendly AI problem\", now that the field was starting to become a Real Thing. Both parties disliked Bostrom's \"the control problem\". In conversation, Russell proposed \"the alignment problem\", and MIRI liked it, so Russell and MIRI both started using the term in public.\n\nUnfortunately, it gradually came to light that Russell and MIRI had understood \"Friendly AI\" to mean two moderately different things, and this disconnect now turned into a split between how MIRI used \"(AI) alignment\" and how Russell used \"(value) alignment\". (Which I think also influenced the split between Paul Christiano's \"(intent) alignment\" and MIRI's \"(outcome) alignment\".)\n\nRussell's version of \"friendliness/alignment\" was about making the AI have good, human-deferential goals. But *Creating Friendly AI 1.0* had been very explicit that \"friendliness\" was about good *behavior*, regardless of how that's achieved. MIRI's conception of \"the alignment problem\" (like Bostrom's \"control problem\") included tools like capability constraint and boxing, because the thing we wanted researchers to focus on was *the goal of leveraging AI capabilities to get actually-good outcomes, whatever technical work that requires*, not some proxy goal that might turn out to be surprisingly irrelevant.\n\nAgain, we wanted a field of people keeping their eye on the ball and looking for clever technical ways to get the job done, rather than a field that neglects some actually-useful technique because it doesn't fit their narrow definition of \"alignment\".\n\n*   Meanwhile, developments like the rise of deep learning had updated MIRI that CEV was not going to be a realistic thing to shoot for with your first AI. We were still thinking of some version of CEV as the ultimate goal, but it now seemed clear that capabilities were progressing too quickly for humanity to have time to nail down all the details of CEV, and it was also clear that the approaches to AI that were winning out would be far harder to analyze, predict, and \"aim\" than 2001-Eliezer had expected. It seemed clear that if AI was going to help make the future go well, the first order of business would be to do the minimal thing to prevent other AIs from destroying the world six months later, with other parts of alignment/friendliness deferred to later.\n\nI think considerations like this eventually trickled in to how MIRI used the term \"alignment\". Our first public writing reflecting the switch from \"Friendly AI\" to \"alignment\", our Dec. 2014 [agent foundations research agenda](https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf), said:\n\n> We call a smarter-than-human system that reliably pursues beneficial goals “aligned with human interests” or simply “aligned.”\n\nWhereas by July 2016, when we released [a new research agenda that was more ML-focused](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf), \"aligned\" was shorthand for \"aligned with the interests of the operators\".\n\nIn practice, we started using \"aligned\" to mean something more like \"aimable\" (where aimability includes things like corrigibility, limiting side-effects, monitoring and limiting capabilities, etc., not just \"getting the AI to predictably tile the universe with smiley faces rather than paperclips\"). Focusing on CEV-ish systems mostly seemed like a distraction, and an invitation to get caught up in moral philosophy and pie-in-the-sky abstractions, when \"do a pivotal act\" is legitimately a hugely more philosophically shallow topic than \"implement CEV\". Instead, we went out of our way to frame the challenge of alignment in a way that seemed almost comically simple and \"un-philosophical\", but that successfully captured all of the key obstacles: 'explain how to use an AI to cause there two exist [two strawberries that are identical at the cellular level](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SsCQHjqNT3xQAPQ6b/yudkowsky-on-agi-ethics), without causing anything weird or disruptive to happen in the process'.\n\nSince realistic pivotal acts still seemed pretty outside the Overton window (and since we were mostly focused on our own research at the time), we wrote up our basic thoughts about the topic on Arbital but didn't try to super-popularize the topic among rationalists or EAs at the time. (Which unfortunately, I think, exacerbated a situation where the larger communities had very fuzzy models of the strategic situation, and fuzzy models of what the point even was of this \"alignment research\" thing; alignment research just become a thing-that-was-good-because-it-was-a-good, not a concrete part of a plan backchained from concrete real-world goals.)\n\nI don't think MIRI wants to stop using \"aligned\" in the context of pivotal acts, and I also don't think MIRI wants to totally divorce the term from the original long-term goal of friendliness/alignment.\n\nTurning \"alignment\" purely into a matter of \"get the AI to do what a particular stakeholder wants\" is good in some ways -- e.g., it clarifies that the level of alignment needed for pivotal acts could also be used to do bad things.\n\nBut from Eliezer's perspective, this move would also be sending a message to all the young Eliezers \"Alignment Research is what you do if you're a serious sober person who thinks it's naive to care about Doing The Right Thing and is instead just trying to make AI Useful To Powerful People; if you want to aim for the obvious desideratum of making AI friendly and beneficial to the world, go join e/acc or something\". Which does not seem ideal.\n\nSo I think my proposed solution would be to just acknowledge that 'the alignment problem' is ambiguous between three different (overlapping) efforts to figure out how to get good and/or intended outcomes from powerful AI systems:\n\n*   **intent alignment**, which is about getting AIs to try to do what the AI thinks the user wants, and in practice seems to be most interested in 'how do we get AIs to be generically trying-to-be-helpful'.\n*   **\"strawberry problem\" alignment**, which is about getting AIs to safely, reliably, and efficiently do *a small number of specific concrete tasks* that are very difficult, for the sake of ending the acute existential risk period.\n*   **CEV-style alignment**, which is about getting AIs to fully figure out how to make the future good.\n\nPlausibly it would help to have better names for the latter two things. The distinction is similar to \"narrow value learning vs. ambitious value learning\", but both problems (as MIRI thinks about them) are a lot more general than just \"value learning\", and there's a lot more content to the strawberry problem than to \"narrow alignment\", and more content to CEV than to \"ambitious value learning\" (e.g., CEV cares about aggregation across people, not just about extrapolation).\n\n(Note: Take the above summary of MIRI's history with a grain of salt; I had Nate Soares look at this comment and he said \"on a skim, it doesn't seem to quite line up with my recollections nor cut things along the joints I would currently cut them along, but maybe it's better than nothing\".)",
      "plaintextDescription": "From briefly talking to Eliezer about this the other day, I think the story from MIRI's perspective is more like:\n\n * Back in 2001, we defined \"Friendly AI\" as \"The field of study concerned with the production of human-benefiting, non-human-harming actions in Artificial Intelligence systems that have advanced to the point of making real-world plans in pursuit of goals.\"\n\nWe could have defined the goal more narrowly or generically than that, but that just seemed like an invitation to take your eye off the ball: if we aren't going to think about the question of how to get good long-run outcomes from powerful AI systems, who will?\n\nAnd many of the technical and philosophical problems seemed particular to CEV, which seemed like an obvious sort of solution to shoot for: just find some way to leverage the AI's intelligence to solve the problem of extrapolating everyone's preferences in a reasonable way, and of aggregating those preferences fairly.\n\n * Come 2014, Stuart Russell and MIRI were both looking for a new term to replace \"the Friendly AI problem\", now that the field was starting to become a Real Thing. Both parties disliked Bostrom's \"the control problem\". In conversation, Russell proposed \"the alignment problem\", and MIRI liked it, so Russell and MIRI both started using the term in public.\n\nUnfortunately, it gradually came to light that Russell and MIRI had understood \"Friendly AI\" to mean two moderately different things, and this disconnect now turned into a split between how MIRI used \"(AI) alignment\" and how Russell used \"(value) alignment\". (Which I think also influenced the split between Paul Christiano's \"(intent) alignment\" and MIRI's \"(outcome) alignment\".)\n\nRussell's version of \"friendliness/alignment\" was about making the AI have good, human-deferential goals. But Creating Friendly AI 1.0 had been very explicit that \"friendliness\" was about good behavior, regardless of how that's achieved. MIRI's conception of \"the alignment problem\" (like Bostrom's \"co"

If nobody had ever thought of that algorithm for an adder, we would have thereby learned a new algorithm for an adder.

You don't need to understand everything about how a bird works in order to build an airplane; there are compressible principles behind how birds fly; if you understand what's going on you can build flying devices that have significantly more carrying capacity than a bird, and this holds true even if the practical engineering of an airplane requires a bunch of trial and error and messy engineering work.\n*   A mind’s causal structure is allowed to be complicated; we can see the weights, but we don’t thereby have a mastery of the high-level patterns. In the case of humans, neuroscience hasn’t actually worked to give us a mastery of the high-level patterns the human brain is implementing.\n*   Mystery is in the map, not in the territory; reductionism works. Not all sciences that can exist, already exist today.\n\nPossibly the above pointers are only useful if you already grok the point we’re trying to make, and isn’t so useful for communicating a new idea; but perhaps not.",

      "markdown": "Nate and Eliezer have already made some of the high-level points I wanted to make, but they haven't replied to a lot of the specific examples and claims in the OP, and I see some extra value in doing that. (Like, if you think Eliezer and Nate are being revisionist in their claims about what past-MIRI thought, then them re-asserting \"no really, we used to believe X!\" is less convincing than my responding in detail to the specific quotes Matt thinks supports his interpretation, while providing [examples of us saying the opposite](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i5kijcjFJD6bn7dwq/evaluating-the-historical-value-misspecification-argument?commentId=6nvuZekG5PDJB4T3H).)\n\n> *However, I distinctly recall MIRI people making a big deal about the* [*value identification problem*](https://arbital.com/p/value_identification/) *(AKA the value specification problem)*\n\nThe Arbital page for \"value identification problem\" is a three-sentence stub, I'm not exactly sure what the term means on that stub (e.g., whether \"pinpointing valuable outcomes to an advanced agent\" is about pinpointing them in the agent's beliefs or in its goals), and the MIRI website gives me no hits for \"value identification\".\n\nAs for \"value specification\", the main resource where MIRI talks about that is [https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf,](https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf,) where we introduce the problem by saying:\n\n> A highly-reliable, error-tolerant agent design does not guarantee a positive impact; the effects of the system still depend upon whether it is pursuing appropriate goals.\n> \n> A superintelligent system may find clever, unintended ways to achieve the specific goals that it is given. Imagine a superintelligent system designed to cure cancer which does so by stealing resources, proliferating robotic laboratories at the expense of the biosphere, and kidnapping test subjects: the intended goal may have been “cure cancer without doing anything bad,” but such a goal is rooted in cultural context and shared human knowledge.\n> \n> It is not sufficient to construct systems that are smart enough to figure out the intended goals. Human beings, upon learning that natural selection “intended” sex to be pleasurable only for purposes of reproduction, do not suddenly decide that contraceptives are abhorrent. While one should not anthropomorphize natural selection, humans are capable of understanding the process which created them while being completely unmotivated to alter their preferences. For similar reasons, when developing AI systems, it is not sufficient to develop a system intelligent enough to figure out the intended goals; the system must also somehow be deliberately constructed to pursue them (Bostrom 2014, chap. 8).\n\nSo I don't think we've ever said that an important subproblem of AI alignment is \"make AI smart enough to figure out what goals humans want\"?\n\n> *for example in* [*this 2016 talk from Yudkowsky*](https://intelligence.org/2016/12/28/ai-alignment-why-its-hard-and-where-to-start/)*.*\n> \n> \\[footnote:\\] *More specifically, in* [*the talk*](https://intelligence.org/2016/12/28/ai-alignment-why-its-hard-and-where-to-start/)*, at one point Yudkowsky asks \"Why expect that \\[alignment\\] is hard?\" and goes on to tell a fable about programmers misspecifying a utility function, which then gets optimized by an AI with disastrous consequences. My best interpretation of this part of the talk is that he's saying the value identification problem is one of the primary reasons why alignment is hard. However, I encourage you to read* [*the transcript*](https://intelligence.org/2016/12/28/ai-alignment-why-its-hard-and-where-to-start/) *yourself if you are skeptical of my interpretation.*\n\nI don't see him saying anywhere \"the issue is that the AI doesn't understand human goals\". In fact, the fable explicitly treats the AGI as being smart enough to understand English and have reasonable English-language conversations with the programmers:\n\n> With that said: What if programmers build an artificial general intelligence to optimize for smiles? Smiles are good, right? Smiles happen when good things happen.\n> \n> During the development phase of this artificial general intelligence, the only options available to the AI might be that it can produce smiles by making people around it happy and satisfied. The AI appears to be producing beneficial effects upon the world, and it *is* producing beneficial effects upon the world so far.\n> \n> Now the programmers upgrade the code. They add some hardware. The artificial general intelligence gets smarter. It can now evaluate a wider space of policy options—not necessarily because it has new motors, new actuators, but because it is now smart enough to forecast the effects of more subtle policies. It says, “I thought of a great way of producing smiles! Can I inject heroin into people?” And the programmers say, “No! We will add a penalty term to your utility function for administering drugs to people.” And now the AGI appears to be working great again.\n> \n> They further improve the AGI. The AGI realizes that, OK, it doesn’t want to add heroin anymore, but it still wants to tamper with your brain so that it expresses extremely high levels of endogenous opiates. That’s not heroin, right?\n> \n> It is now also smart enough to model the psychology of the programmers, at least in a very crude fashion, and realize that this is not what the programmers want. If I start taking initial actions that look like it’s heading toward genetically engineering brains to express endogenous opiates, my programmers will edit my utility function. If they edit the utility function of my future self, I will get less of my current utility. (That’s one of the convergent instrumental strategies, unless otherwise averted: protect your utility function.) So it keeps its outward behavior reassuring. Maybe the programmers are really excited, because the AGI seems to be getting lots of new moral problems right—whatever they’re doing, it’s working great!\n\nI think the point of the smiles example here isn't \"NLP is hard, so we'd use the proxy of smiles instead, and all the issues of alignment are downstream of this\"; rather, it's that as a rule, superficially nice-seeming goals that work fine when the AI is optimizing weakly (whether or not it's good at NLP at the time) break down when those same goals are optimized very hard. The smiley example makes this obvious because the goal is simple enough that it's easy for us to see what its implications are; far more complex goals *also* tend to break down when optimized hard enough, but this is harder to see because it's harder to see the implications. (Which is why \"smiley\" is used here.)\n\n> *MIRI people frequently claimed that solving the value identification problem would be hard, or at least non-trivial.*[*^\\[6\\]^*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i5kijcjFJD6bn7dwq/evaluating-the-historical-value-misspecification-argument#fn9woqm9jgal)*For instance, Nate Soares wrote in his* [*2016 paper on value learning*](https://human%20preferences%20are%20complex%2C%20multi-faceted%2C%20and%20often%20contradictory.%20safely%20extracting%20preferences%20from%20a%20model%20of%20a%20human%20would%20be%20no%20easy%20task./)*, that \"Human preferences are complex, multi-faceted, and often contradictory. Safely extracting preferences from a model of a human would be no easy task.\"*\n\nThat link is broken; the paper is [https://intelligence.org/files/ValueLearningProblem.pdf.](https://intelligence.org/files/ValueLearningProblem.pdf.) The full paragraph here is:\n\n> Human preferences are complex, multi-faceted, and often contradictory. Safely extracting preferences from a model of a human would be no easy task. Problems of ontology identification recur here: the framework for extracting preferences and affecting outcome ratings needs to be robust to drastic changes in the learner’s model of the operator. The special-case identification of the “operator model” must survive as the system goes from modeling the operator as a simple reward function to modeling the operator as a fuzzy, ever-changing part of reality built out of biological cells—which are made of atoms, which arise from quantum fields.\n\nRevisiting the Ontology Identification section helps clarify what Nate means by \"safely extracting preferences from a model of a human\": IIUC, he's talking about a programmer looking at an AI's brain, identifying the part of the AI's brain that is modeling the human, identifying the part of the AI's brain that is \"the human's preferences\" within that model of a human, and then manually editing the AI's brain to \"hook up\" the model-of-a-human-preference to the AI's goals/motivations, in such a way that the AI *optimizes for* what it models the humans as wanting. (Or some other, less-toy process that amounts to the same thing -- e.g., one assisted by automated interpretability tools.)\n\n> In this toy example, we can assume that the programmers look at the structure of the initial world-model and hard-code a tool for identifying the atoms within. What happens, then, if the system develops a nuclear model of physics, in which the ontology of the universe now contains primitive protons, neutrons, and electrons instead of primitive atoms? The system might fail to identify any carbon atoms in the new world-model, making the system indifferent between all outcomes in the dominant hypothesis. Its actions would then be dominated by any tiny remaining probabilities that it is in a universe where fundamental carbon atoms are hiding somewhere.\n> \n> \\[...\\]\n> \n> To design a system that classifies potential outcomes according to how much diamond is in them, some mechanism is needed for identifying the intended ontology of the training data within the potential outcomes as currently modeled by the AI. This is the *ontology identification problem* introduced by de Blanc \\[2011\\] and further discussed by Soares \\[2015\\].\n> \n> This problem is not a traditional focus of machine learning work. When our only concern is that systems form better world-models, then an argument can be made that the nuts and bolts are less important. As long as the system’s new world-model better predicts the data than its old world-model, the question of whether diamonds or atoms are “really represented” in either model isn’t obviously significant. When the system needs to consistently pursue certain outcomes, however, it matters that the system’s internal dynamics preserve (or improve) its representation of which outcomes are desirable, independent of how helpful its representations are for prediction. The problem of making correct choices is not reducible to the problem of making accurate predictions.\n> \n> Inductive value learning requires the construction of an outcome-classifier from value-labeled training data, but it also requires some method for identifying, inside the states or potential states described in its world-model, the referents of the labels in the training data.\n\nAs Nate and I noted in other comments, the paper repeatedly clarifies that the core issue isn't about whether the AI is good at NLP. Quoting the paper's abstract:\n\n> Even a machine intelligent enough to understand its designers’ intentions would not necessarily *act* as intended. \n\nAnd the lede section:\n\n> The novelty here is not that programs can exhibit incorrect or counter-intuitive behavior, but that software agents smart enough to *understand* natural language may still *base their decisions* on misrepresentations of their programmers’ intent. The idea of superintelligent agents monomaniacally pursuing “dumb”-seeming goals may sound odd, but it follows from the observation of Bostrom and Yudkowsky \\[2014, chap. 7\\] that AI capabilities and goals are logically independent.\\[1\\] Humans can fully comprehend that their “designer” (evolution) had a particular “goal” (reproduction) in mind for sex, without thereby feeling compelled to forsake contraception. Instilling one’s tastes or moral values into an heir isn’t impossible, but it also doesn’t happen automatically.\n\nBack to your post:\n\n> *And to be clear, I don't mean that GPT-4 merely passively \"understands\" human values. I mean that asking GPT-4 to distinguish valuable and non-valuable outcomes works pretty well at approximating the human value function* in practice\n\nI don't think I understand what difference you have in mind here, or why you think it's important. Doesn't \"this AI understands X\" more-or-less imply \"this AI can successfully distinguish X from not-X in practice\"?\n\n> *This fact is key to what I'm saying because it means that, in the near future, we can literally just query multimodal GPT-N about whether an outcome is bad or good, and use that as an adequate \"human value function\". That wouldn't solve the problem of getting an AI to care about maximizing the human value function, but it would arguably solve the problem of creating an adequate function that we can put into a machine to begin with.*\n\nBut we could already query the human value function by having the AI system query an actual human. What specific problem is meant to be solved by swapping out \"query a human\" for \"query an AI\"?\n\n> *I interpret this passage as saying that 'the problem' is extracting all the judgements that \"you would make\", and putting that into a wish. I think he's implying that these judgements are essentially fully contained in your brain. I don't think it's credible to insist he was referring to a hypothetical ideal human value function that ordinary humans only have limited access to, at least in this essay.*\n\nAbsolutely. But as Eliezer clarified in his [reply](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i5kijcjFJD6bn7dwq/evaluating-the-historical-value-misspecification-argument?commentId=tq7NyfQ9sivn7YSYo), the issue he was worried about was getting specific complex content into the agent's goals, not getting specific complex content into the agent's beliefs. Which is maybe clearer in the [2011 paper](https://intelligence.org/files/ComplexValues.pdf) where he gave the same example and explicitly said that the issue was the agent's \"utility function\".\n\n> *For example, a straightforward reading of* [*Nate Soares' 2017 talk*](https://intelligence.org/2017/04/12/ensuring/) *supports this interpretation. In the talk, Soares provides a fictional portrayal of value misalignment, drawing from the movie Fantasia. In the story, Mickey Mouse attempts to instruct a magical broom to fill a cauldron, but the broom follows the instructions literally rather than following what Mickey Mouse intended, and floods the room. Soares comments: \"I claim that as fictional depictions of AI go, this is pretty realistic.*\n\nAs I said in another [comment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i5kijcjFJD6bn7dwq/evaluating-the-historical-value-misspecification-argument?commentId=fNYquXJ6xpaXZWxyh):\n\n> \"Fill the cauldron\" examples are examples where the cauldron-filler has the wrong utility function, not examples where it has the wrong beliefs. E.g., this is explicit in [https://intelligence.org/2016/12/28/ai-alignment-why-its-hard-and-where-to-start/](https://intelligence.org/2016/12/28/ai-alignment-why-its-hard-and-where-to-start/) \n> \n> The idea of the \"fill the cauldron\" examples isn't \"the AI is bad at NLP and therefore doesn't understand what we mean when we say 'fill', 'cauldron', etc.\" It's \"even simple small-scale tasks are unnatural, in the sense that it's hard to define a coherent preference ordering over world-states such that maximizing it completes the task and has no serious negative impact; and there isn't an obvious patch that overcomes the unnaturalness or otherwise makes it predictably easier to aim AI systems at a bounded low-impact task like this\". (Including easier to aim via training.)\n\nIt's true that 'value is relatively complex' is part of why it's hard to get the right goal into an AGI; but it doesn't follow from this that 'AI is able to develop pretty accurate beliefs about our values' helps *get* those complex values into the AGI's goals. (It does provide nonzero evidence about *how* complex value is, but I don't see you arguing that value is very simple in any absolute sense, just that it's simple *enough* for GPT-4 to learn decently well. Which is not reassuring, because GPT-4 is able to learn a lot of very complicated things, so this doesn't do much to bound the complexity of human value.)\n\nIn any case, I take this confusion as evidence that the fill-the-cauldron example might not be very useful. Or maybe all these examples just need to explicitly specify, going forward, that the AI is part-human at understanding English.\n\n> *Perhaps more important to my point, Soares presented a clean separation between the part where we specify an AI's objectives, and the part where the AI tries to maximizes those objectives. He draws two arrows, indicating that MIRI is concerned about both parts.*\n> \n> ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/i5kijcjFJD6bn7dwq/d4ujynglutkacpzglvcr)\n\nYour image isn't displaying for me, but I assume it's this one?\n\n![vl-argmax.png](https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vl-argmax.png)\n\nI don't know what you mean by \"specify an AI's objectives\" here, but the specific term Nate uses here is \"value learning\" (not \"value specification\" or \"value identification\"). And Nate's [Value Learning Problem](https://intelligence.org/files/ValueLearningProblem.pdf) paper, as I noted above, explicitly disclaims that 'get the AI to be smart enough to output reasonable-sounding moral judgments' is a core part of the problem.\n\n> *He states, \"The serious question with smarter-than-human AI is how we can ensure that the objectives we’ve specified are correct, and how we can minimize costly accidents and unintended consequences in cases of misspecification.\" I believe this quote refers directly to the value identification problem, rather than the problem of getting an AI to care about following the goals we've given it.*\n\nThe way you quoted this makes it sound like a gloss on the image, but it's actually a quote from the very start of the talk:\n\n> The notion of AI systems “breaking free” of the shackles of their source code or spontaneously developing human-like desires is just confused. The AI system *is* its source code, and its actions will only ever follow from the execution of the instructions that we initiate. The CPU just keeps on executing the next instruction in the program register. We could write a program that manipulates its own code, including coded objectives. Even then, though, the manipulations that it makes are made as a result of executing the original code that we wrote; they do not stem from some kind of ghost in the machine.\n> \n> The serious question with smarter-than-human AI is how we can ensure that the objectives we’ve specified are correct, and how we can minimize costly accidents and unintended consequences in cases of misspecification. As Stuart Russell (co-author of *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*) [puts it](https://www.edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015):\n> \n> > The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make *high-quality decisions*. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome utility of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer. Now we have a problem:\n> > \n> > 1\\. The utility function may not be perfectly aligned with the values of the human race, which are (at best) very difficult to pin down.\n> > \n> > 2\\. Any sufficiently capable intelligent system will prefer to ensure its own continued existence and to acquire physical and computational resources – not for their own sake, but to succeed in its assigned task. \\[...\\]\n\nI wouldn't read too much into the word choice here, since I think it's just trying to introduce the Russell quote, which is (again) explicitly about getting content into the AI's goals, not about getting content into the AI's beliefs.\n\n(In general, I think the phrase \"value specification\" is sort of confusingly vague. I'm not sure what the best replacement is for it -- maybe just \"value loading\", following Bostrom? -- but I suspect MIRI's usage of it has been needlessly confusing. Back in 2014, we reluctantly settled on it as jargon for \"the part of the alignment problem that isn't subsumed in getting the AI to reliably maximize diamonds\", because this struck us as a smallish but nontrivial part of the problem; but I think it's easy to read the term as referring to something a lot more narrow.)\n\n> *The point of \"*[*the genie knows but doesn't care*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NyFuuKQ8uCEDtd2du/the-genie-knows-but-doesn-t-care)*\" wasn't that the AI would take your instructions, know what you want, and yet disobey the instructions because it doesn't care about what you asked for. If you read* [*Rob Bensinger's essay*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NyFuuKQ8uCEDtd2du/the-genie-knows-but-doesn-t-care) *carefully, you'll find that he's actually warning that the AI will care too much about the utility function you gave it, and maximize it exactly, against your intentions*[*^\\[10\\]^*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i5kijcjFJD6bn7dwq/evaluating-the-historical-value-misspecification-argument#fnuahq0ks4gl)*.*\n\nYep -- I think I'd have endorsed claims like \"by default, a baby AGI won't share your values even if it understands them\" at the time, but IIRC the essay doesn't make that point explicitly, and some of the points it does make seem either false (wait, we're going to be able to hand AGI a hand-written utility function? that's somehow tractable?) or confusingly written. (Like, if my point was '*even if* you could hand-write a utility function, this fails at point X', I should have made that 'even if' louder.)\n\nSome MIRI staff liked that essay at the time, so I don't think it's useless, but it's not the best evidence: I wrote it not long after I first started learning about this whole 'superintelligence risk' thing, and I posted it before I'd ever worked at MIRI.",

This is one of them. Bad argument gets counterargument. Does not get bullet. Never. Never ever never for ever.\"*\n> \n> Why is this a rationality injunction instead of a legal injunction? Because the point is protecting “the marketplace of ideas” where arguments succeed based on the evidence supporting or opposing them and not based on the relative firepower of their proponents and detractors. \\[...\\]\n> \n> What does “bullet” mean in the quote above? Are other projectiles covered? Arrows? Boulders launched from catapults? What about melee weapons like swords or maces? Where exactly do we draw the line for “inappropriate responses to an argument”?\n> \n> A good response to an argument is one that addresses an idea; a bad argument is one that silences it. If you try to address an idea, your success depends on how good the idea is; if you try to silence it, your success depends on how powerful you are and how many pitchforks and torches you can provide on short notice.\n> \n> Shooting bullets is a good way to silence an idea without addressing it. So is firing stones from catapults, or slicing people open with swords, or gathering a pitchfork-wielding mob.\n> \n> But trying to get someone fired for holding an idea is *also* a way of silencing an idea without addressing it. I’m sick of talking about Phil Robertson, so let’s talk about [the Alabama woman who was fired for having a Kerry-Edwards bumper sticker on her car](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2004/09/bumper_sticker_insubordination.html) (her boss supported Bush). Could be an easy way to quiet support for a candidate you don’t like. Oh, there are more Bush voters than Kerry voters in this county? Let’s bombard her workplace with letters until they fire her! Now she’s broke and has to sit at home trying to scrape money together to afford food and ruing the day she ever dared to challenge our prejudices! And the next person to disagree with the rest of us will think twice before opening their mouth!\n> \n> The e-version of this practice is “doxxing”, where you hunt down an online commenter’s personally identifiable information including address. Then you either harass people they know personally, spam their place of employment with angry comments, or post it on the Internet for everyone to see, probably with a message like “I would never threaten this person at their home address *myself*, but if one of my followers wants to, I *guess* I can’t stop them.” This was the Jezebel strategy that Michael was most complaining about. Freethought Blogs is also [particularly](http://heathen-hub.com/blog.php?b=1712) [famous](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rockbeyondbelief/2012/12/23/greg-laden-posts-a-home-address-and-employer-contacts-for-online-rival/) for this tactic and often devolves into [sagas](http://uberfeminist.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-sciam-blog-drama.html) that would make [MsScribe herself](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/23/we-are-all-msscribe/) proud.\n> \n> A lot of people would argue that doxxing holds people “accountable” for what they say online. But like most methods of silencing speech, its ability to punish people for saying the wrong things is entirely uncorrelated with whether the thing they said is actually wrong. It distributes power based on who controls the largest mob (hint: popular people) and who has the resources, job security, and physical security necessary to outlast a personal attack (hint: rich people). If you try to hold the Koch Brothers “accountable” for muddying the climate change waters, they will laugh in your face. If you try to hold closeted gay people “accountable” for promoting gay rights, it will be very easy and you will successfully ruin their lives. Do you really want to promote a policy that works this way?\n> \n> There are even more subtle ways of silencing an idea than trying to get its proponents fired or real-life harassed. For example, you can always just harass them online. The stronger forms of this, like death threats and rape threats, are of course illegal. But that still leaves many opportunities for constant verbal abuse, crude sexual jokes, insults aimed at family members, and dozens of emails written in all capital letters about what sorts of colorful punishments you and the people close to you deserve. \\[...\\]\n> \n> My answer to the “Doctrine Of The Preferred First Speaker” ought to be clear by now. The conflict isn’t always just between first speaker and second speaker, it can also be between someone who’s trying to debate versus someone who’s trying to silence. Telling a bounty hunter on the phone “I’ll pay you $10 million to kill Bob” is a form of speech, but its goal is to silence rather than to counterargue. So is commenting “YOU ARE A SLUT AND I HOPE YOUR FAMILY DIES” on a blog. And so is orchestrating a letter-writing campaign demanding a business fire someone who vocally supports John Kerry.\n> \n> Bad argument gets counterargument. Does not get bullet. Does not get doxxing. Does not get harassment. Does not get fired from job. Gets counterargument. Should not be hard.",
      "plaintextDescription": "As I think of it, the heart of the \"bad argument gets counterargument\" notion is \"respond to arguments using reasoning, not coercion\", rather than \"literal physical violence is a unique category of thing that is never OK\". Both strike me as good norms, but the former seems deeper and more novel to me, closer to the heart of things.
