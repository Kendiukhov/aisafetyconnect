My best guess is that the reason you don't see it is that you don't see the phenomena that are failing to be modelled by conventional methods (or at least don't understand how those phenomena related to the birds-eye perspective), so you don't realize what new thing is missing. And I can't easily cure this kind of cluelessness with examples, because my theories aren't necessary if you just consider a single very narrow and homogenous phenomenon as then you can just make a special-built theory for that.",

It seems to me that Cremieux tends to do so, and so he is not a racist bigot.\n\nI think part of what can get him persecuted for being a racist bigot is that a lot of rationalists follow him and more-or-less endorse (or at least defend) racist stuff without being willing to present cruxes, i.e. his fans are racist bigots. It's hard for people to distinguish a writer from their fans, and I suspect this might be best addressed by writers being more internally oriented towards their fans rather than outwards oriented.",
