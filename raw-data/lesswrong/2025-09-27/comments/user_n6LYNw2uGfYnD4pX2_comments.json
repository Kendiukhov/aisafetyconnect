E.g., will a truly enlightened person never suffer again?\n\nDaniel Ingram reports once temporarily losing his insights and ending up back in a state of suffering during a bout of severe sickness.\n\nAs for \"never\" suffering again, it is important to understand that awakening drops suffing by perhaps an order of magnitude, but not to zero. There are many different kinds of suffering. Each awakening cures one or more kinds of suffering (usually the most salient ones), but not all of them. It's like cleaning a room. After you throw away the junk, there's still dusting to do.\n\n> 1.2 Or is it a weaker claim of the form \"once one learns the motion of enlightenment, it can be repeated to eliminate suffering at will\"? Or something else entirely?\n\nThis is a tricky quesion, so I'm going to give a simplified answer.\n\nIn the case of stream entry via Zen, first you learn to eliminate suffering at will. Then, after you put in the work, that temporary altered state eventually becomes a permament altered trait.\n\n> 2.  I've read Shinzen Young's \"The Science of Enlightenment\". He describes how in some intermediate stage, he started hallucinating giant insects in his daily life. Have you made similar experiences? How do you interpret them? Do you consider such experiences dangerous? Are such experiences distinct from schizophrenia in a relevant way?\n\nI have had two psychotic episodes. Both of them were dangerous, temporary, and precipitated by a combination of insight cycle + sleep deprivation + [psychomagic](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Your-Life-Into-Art/dp/1734965924). In this sense, they are not something that occur in my daily life. In both experiences, I experienced schizophrenia-like delusions, but not schizophrenia-like hallucinations[^1]. The most important difference (to me) is that these experiences were temporary, unlike schizophrenia.\n\n[^1]: I have heard that visual meditation ([kasina](https://www.reddit.com/r/kasina/comments/rues02/how_to_practice_kasina_meditation_a_guide_for/)) is more likely to produce visual hallucinations. I have done only a little kasina.\n\nBoth of these experiences accelerated my progress of insight, but it wasn't worth the damage they did to my daily life. If I had had similar experiences under controlled circumstances, perhaps they would have been a net good, instead.\n\n> 3.1 As far as I understand, enlightened people don't cling to a specific reality anymore, but they may still have strong desires. Is this your typical experience? How do you relate to your desires?\n\nI'm going to nitpick some terminology here. Enlightenment cures desire. What it leaves are motivations. This can be confusing to unenlightened people because to unenlightened people, desire and motivation are difficult to untangle from one another.\n\nAs an example of what motivation without desire can feel like, consider a doctor who has treated countless cancer patients. Some live; others die. The doctor works hard to help them all, but she's long past suffering when one of them dies.\n\nWhen I hit stream entry, my desire was (mostly?) annihilated. For the next several months, my desire-motivated habits slowly ran out of inertia. Since then, I my brain has been integrating non-desire-based motivational systems.\n\n> 3.2 Is it compatible to be (a) enlightened, (b) have a desire that leads to amoral actions when acted upon them, and (c) acting on those desires?\n\nTechnically-speaking, it is impossible to be enlightened and have desire. However, in the Zen tradition, enlightenment is sort of a like a limit point (in the [mathematical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics))) or absolute zero temperature. It's more of an abstract concept you're calibrating toward rather than a place you can really get to. Awakening is, in this sense, imperfect. It's possible to have traces of desire after awakening—just at trace levels much lower than un-enlightened people.\n\nAs for amoral actions, awakened people absolutely can commit them! They're just not desire-motivated. An awakened person could crash a car and kill pedestrians, for example. It's easy for me to imagine an awakened cult leader who brainwashes people.\n\n> 4.1 Is any amount of pain/anxiety/sadness/anger/etc. compatible with being in a state of [approximately] zero suffering?\n\nI'm going to erata your question from \"zero suffering\" to \"approximately zero suffering\". The word \"zero\" can easily cause confusion because mystics use a absolute zero-based scale for suffering whereas people who haven't done insight practice percieve what feels like an absolut-zero-based scale but is actually a non-absolute-zero-based scale. In physics, things get [weird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate) when you approach absolute zero. The same is true of insight into consciousness.\n\n- Pain: Sensory inputs that, in un-enlightened people, coalesce into pain is compatible with zero suffering. In enlightened people the coalescing doesn't happen and you feel the raw sensory inputs directly. It feels like vibrations.\n- Anxiety: Anxiety is incompatible with non-suffering. Cure suffering and you cure anxiety.\n- Sadnesss: Perfectly compatible with zero suffering. I've written about the experience [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/1b1whpo/a_moment_of_sadness/).\n- Anger: With rare exceptions (truly righteous anger), anger is incompatible with non-suffering.\n\n> 4.2  Is zero suffering in practice harder to maintain for higher levels of these displeasures, or will a once-enlightened person not find any of these experiences difficult to combine with a state of non-suffering?\n\nThis confuses altered states with altered traits. Altered states of consciousness, like jhanas, are temporary states you put effort into maintaining. Altered traits like awakening don't require any effort whatsoever to maintain. They're like your belief in gravity. You don't have put practice into maintaining your belief in gravity. No matter how much someone waterboards you, it's not going to change your belief that water is wet.\n\n> 5 Are there degrees of enlightenment, or is it more of a discrete change?\n\nThere are degrees to it. They can be continuous, but in my experience they are more often discrete. Each insight cycle roughly correlates with one awakening.\n\nThat said, your first awakening is so important it has a special name: \"stream entry\".\n\n> 6. How much control can an enlightened person have over their experience? 6.1 Is it possible to decide to not hear/see/smell/feel/taste something?\n\nI haven't done this, but people on the jhana side of things do. All you have to do is concentrate on something else. Think about when you're so engaged in reading a book that you don't notice the sounds coming through your window. It's the same thing.\n\n> 6.2 Is it possible to stop thinking at will?\n\nYou mean discursive thinking like that voice in your head? Yeah, we do that in shikantaza. After you turn it off what's left is the sensation of the breath, the sound of wind chimes outside and, if your eyes are open, the image of the wall in front of you. It takes me about 30 minutes of deliberate intention in a peaceful room to get into this state.\n\n> 6.3 Is it possible to feel pleasure or bliss at will?\n\nYes. There are even different kinds of bliss. The jhana practitioners say that first jhana is like this. The easiest way to turn on the happiness hose is probably through metta meditation.\n\n> 6.4 Is it possible to change ones experience at will / to hallucinate arbitrary experiences at will?\n\nTruly arbitrary experiences? No. But you can get a lot of control over things. But you can get controlled staticish visual hallucinations, MDMA-like experiences on demand and, of course, dismantle the machinery of suffering.\n",

I sit in my best approximation of full lotus position (moving my legs if I was worried about joint damage) and gently bring my attention to my breath at the base of my nostrils. When my attention drifts, I bring it back. I get my best results in Zendo and in a quiet park on a nice day, but can do whenever just to get the hours in. Meditating on the lightrail (when I was going somewhere anywhere) has been helpful too, even though it is difficult to achieve access concentration on it.\n\nIt also helps to do few days of meditation in a row. If I did 45 minutes of meditation every day, then access concentration might show up around the 30 minute mark of the third day.\n\nIf you're having trouble with access concentration, then I recommend doing your meditation with eyes open. Pick a point to look at and don't divert your eyes from there.\n\nFinally, a warning: This meditation stuff can make sensory overload worse [for months] before it makes it better.\n",

In the long run, learning written Chinese will eventually be necessary to building a large vocabulary. But until you feel that holding you back, there's nothing wrong with focusing on the spoken language.\n\nDifferentiating accents is not important. You are correct to deprioritize it.\n\nFor more video immersion resources, I recommend Douyin. Getting it onto your phone can be tricky, but once you do it's a great source of video immersion.\n\n> Is there any particular Anki deck you'd recommend (with pinyin and audio)? Should I just use the probability table and generate it myself?\n\nIt has been many years since I have used Anki for Chinese, so I don't know which deck is currently the best. There aren't a huge number of Chinese decks on ankiweb, so you can just try out the top rated ones and pick whichever one you like. (Or generate it yourself. The last time I checked on ankiweb, the decks there were from created before computer voice got good.)\n\n> Is there any particular video or podcast channel you'd recommend at a beginner level (100-500 words vocabulary)?\n\nThis is probably too hard for your right now, but my favorite beginner-level podcast is [慢速中文 - Slow Chinese](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/hd5ct-1b062c/Slow-Chinese-Podcast---%E6%85%A2%E9%80%9F%E6%B1%89%E8%AF%AD-Learn-Chinese-%E5%AD%A6%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87).\n\n> Would you recommend I try generating my own video?\n\nNo. The video part is basically a waste of compute. What matters is the audio. Generating audio and text can be useful.\n\nIn particular, I've been experimenting with ChatGPT's advanced voice mode and it's fantastic for language immersion. I give it the following instructions: \"Always speak to me in Japanese [or, in your case, Chinese], unless I ask you 'How do you say ___ in Japanese' or 'What does ___ mean in English'?\" Actually getting it to follow those instructions is finicky, but when I get it to work, the result is basically an on-demand personal immersion tutor that never gets bored.",

      "markdown": "This is indeed a hard problem, hence why this stuff is so illegible. First I'll define how I use these terms.\n\n- **Meditation** is sitting quietly and stabilizing your mind. (Technically-speaking, some people consider zazen meditation-adjacent and therefore technically not meditation. This distinction is not relevant to this post.)\n- **Jhanas** are altered states of consciousness characterized by stability of attention. There are other altered states of consciousness relevant to Awakening, such as mushin.\n- **Stream Entry** (aka **Awakening**) is the first big checkpoint on the meditative path. It's when a large chunk of your suffering drops away permanently because of a fundamental shifting in how your consciousness works. Under Zen dogma this happens suddenly, but I believe it can happen gradually.\n- **Arahant** has a traditional Therevada definition that I don't use. In this post, I use Daniel Ingram's [Revised Fourth Path mode](https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-v-awakening/37-models-of-the-stages-of-awakening/a-revised-four-path-model/). I feel the term is unwieldy due to the conflicting definitions. I used it for ease of readability, so that I didn't have to write \"person with the fruit of the meditative path\" over and over again.\n- **Enlightenment** refers to someone who is perfectly realized. It doesn't really exist in our physical universe, but it's useful to aspire to, the way a Carnot Engine or \"a perfectly beautiful painting\" points in a useful direction. (Note: I do sometimes use \"enlightenment\" in other ways—just not in this post.)\n- I don't know what you mean by QRI. I don't think you're referring to the [Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/).\n\nThe first thing to understand is that altered states of consciousness like jhanas are instrumental. I mean, they're useful and pleasant, but they're somewhat orthogonal to [altered traits](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tvuLWPJXjvoQfpbSG/book-review-altered-traits-1). The Powers don't count as insight either. They're just a side-effect.\n\nWhat matters are stages of insight. Whether these are discrete \"stages\" or a continuous process is not important. Sometimes these things happen suddenly, which makes them obvious to you; other times they sneak up on you gradually, over a period of time. That's why Awakened people sometimes don't even know they're Awakened. (And that's not even counting the rare people getting Awakened just randomly outside of a mystic context.)\n\nStatistically-speaking, if you haven't done 100+[^1] hours of meditation and/or had an obvious transformative experience that permanently altered your conscious perception of reality, then you're probably neurotypical, in this respect.\n\n[^1]: I often encounter claims that it can thousands of hours of meditation to hit Stream Entry. For me, it took me significantly less than one thousand hours.\n\nIt's much easier to discern your own state of meditative insight than someone else's. Here are a few examples of signs you can use. All of them are difficult to communicate, since they're so non-normative. Do not take this list as authoritative.\n- 85% or more of your suffering falls away suddenly. It's been a year since then and it still hasn't come back. (This can happen more than once, with compounding effects.)\n- You no longer feel that your \"self\" is in a privileged position against the other stuff in your consciousness.\n- You accidentally touch a hot stove and don't feel any pain. It's been months since your sensory inputs have congealed into pain.\n- Your conscious perception of time and space break down such that they are directly perceived as mental constructs rather than immutable aspects of external reality.\n\nExcept now we have a problem, because the moment I list things like this, people who read the list will (mis?)report these experiences, even if they haven't had them. This happened to one of my teachers. Kriyas somehow entered the pop culture and then his students began reporting them. Which is stupid because kriyas are useful only as a metric of concentrative progress, and this wrecked the utility of kriyas as a metric of concentrative progress.\n\n> How would I discern someone else's state of enlightenment?\n\nThis is even harder than discerning your own level of insight. The most important thing is alignment of incentives—namely, to be in a community where nobody is incentivized to misreport. At my zendo, nobody ever talks about their own level of attainment except in one-on-one private *dokusan* with the head teacher. (You can talk about your own hinderances.) This isn't because there's a hard rule against it; it's just counterproductive, like eating junk food at Fat Camp.\n\nBut just because it's counterproductive to state your own level of attainment doesn't mean it's not useful to get a rough idea other peoples' level of attainment. I consider Zuiko an arahant because of how she talks about (or, more accurately, doesn't talk about) her health problems. Zuiko's hands are failing due to arthritis, but it doesn't seem to bother her. She pays more attention to my new scooter helmet.\n\n> …no intimations of being in the presence of someone who had something real to teach.\n\nThere's a autobiography *Reports from the Zen Wars: The Impossible Rigor of a Questioning Life* by Steve Antinoff. The author notices that a specific Zen Master is highly awakened and wants to become a disciple so he can be the same way. The book is a tragedy, because the author looks externally (to the Zen Master) for teaching, instead of to his own conscious experience.",

If the first thing you write is \"go read this other doc\", then you have failed to establish the prerequisite trust."
