Bowman",2023,"We present GPQA, a challenging dataset of 448 multiple-choice questions written by domain experts in biology, physics, and chemistry. We ensure that the questions are high-quality and extremely difficult: experts who have or are pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 65% accuracy (74% when discounting clear mistakes the experts identified in retrospect), while highly skilled non-expert validators only reach 34% accuracy, despite spending on average over 30 minutes with unrestricted access to the web (i.e., the questions are""Google-proof""). The questions are also difficult for state-of-the-art AI systems, with our strongest GPT-4 based baseline achieving 39% accuracy. If we are to use future AI systems to help us answer very hard questions, for example, when developing new scientific knowledge, we need to develop scalable oversight methods that enable humans to supervise their outputs, which may be difficult even if the supervisors are themselves skilled and knowledgeable. The difficulty of GPQA both for skilled non-experts and frontier AI systems should enable realistic scalable oversight experiments, which we hope can help devise ways for human experts to reliably get truthful information from AI systems that surpass human capabilities.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/210b0a3d76e93079cc51b03c4115fde545eea966,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12022.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/210b0a3d76e93079cc51b03c4115fde545eea966,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Biology, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry",1065,d2390e0e97b7199093a42b27a5cf32bc,,2311.12022,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Chemistry'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Steinhardt",2022,"Research in mechanistic interpretability seeks to explain behaviors of machine learning models in terms of their internal components. However, most previous work either focuses on simple behaviors in small models, or describes complicated behaviors in larger models with broad strokes.

Topol",2023,"The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy.

Steinhardt",2023,"Neural networks often exhibit emergent behavior, where qualitatively new capabilities arise from scaling up the amount of parameters, training data, or training steps. One approach to understanding emergence is to find continuous \textit{progress measures} that underlie the seemingly discontinuous qualitative changes. We argue that progress measures can be found via mechanistic interpretability: reverse-engineering learned behaviors into their individual components. As a case study, we investigate the recently-discovered phenomenon of ``grokking'' exhibited by small transformers trained on modular addition tasks. We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these networks, which uses discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle. We confirm the algorithm by analyzing the activations and weights and by performing ablations in Fourier space. Based on this understanding, we define progress measures that allow us to study the dynamics of training and split training into three continuous phases: memorization, circuit formation, and cleanup. Our results show that grokking, rather than being a sudden shift, arises from the gradual amplification of structured mechanisms encoded in the weights, followed by the later removal of memorizing components.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f680d47a51a0e470fcb228bf0110c026535ead1b,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05217,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f680d47a51a0e470fcb228bf0110c026535ead1b,International Conference on Learning Representations,"Computer Science, Computer Science",517,953089e9556a8e0b37293683f8ff8807,10.48550/arXiv.2301.05217,2301.05217,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:13.784216+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:43.521903+00:00

Mavor-Parker, Aengus Lynch, Stefan Heimersheim, Adrià Garriga-Alonso",2023,"Through considerable effort and intuition, several recent works have reverse-engineered nontrivial behaviors of transformer models. This paper systematizes the mechanistic interpretability process they followed. First, researchers choose a metric and dataset that elicit the desired model behavior.

By varying the dataset, metric, and units under investigation, researchers can understand the functionality of each component. We automate one of the process' steps: to identify the circuit that implements the specified behavior in the model's computational graph. We propose several algorithms and reproduce previous interpretability results to validate them.

Gangadharan, Natalie Heike, Abdelrahman Khalifa, Alessandro Motta, Niansheng Ju, Meike Sievers, J. Gempt, H. S. Meyer, M. Helmstaedter",2022,"The human cerebral cortex houses 1000 times more neurons than that of the cerebral cortex of a mouse, but the possible differences in synaptic circuits between these species are still poorly understood. We used three-dimensional electron microscopy of mouse, macaque, and human cortical samples to study their cell type composition and synaptic circuit architecture. The 2.5-fold increase in interneurons in humans compared with mice was compensated by a change in axonal connection probabilities and therefore did not yield a commensurate increase in inhibitory-versus-excitatory synaptic input balance on human pyramidal cells. Rather, increased inhibition created an expanded interneuron-to-interneuron network, driven by an expansion of interneuron-targeting interneuron types and an increase in their synaptic selectivity for interneuron innervation. These constitute key neuronal network alterations in the human cortex. Description The difference between human and mouse Over the past few decades, the mouse has become a model organism for brain research. Because of the close evolutionary similarity of ion channels, synaptic receptors, and other key molecular constituents of the brain to that of humans, corresponding similarity has been assumed for cortical neuronal circuits. However, comparative synaptic-resolution connectomic studies are required to determine the degree to which circuit structure has evolved between species. Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, Loomba et al. compared mouse and human/macaque cortex synaptic connectivity. Although human cells are much larger compared with mouse neurons and are more numerous, on average, they do not receive more synapses. And, even though there are three times more interneurons in the human cortex than in the mouse, the excitation-to-inhibition ratio is similar between the species. —PRS Three-dimensional electron microscopy of mouse, macaque, and human brain samples elucidates cell type composition and synaptic circuit architecture. INTRODUCTION The analysis of the human brain is a central goal of neuroscience, but for methodological reasons, research has focused on model organisms, the mouse in particular. Because substantial homology was found at the level of ion channels, transcriptional programs, and basic neuronal types, a strong similarity of neuronal circuits across species has also been assumed. However, a rigorous test of the configuration of local neuronal circuitry in mouse versus human—in particular, in the gray matter of the cerebral cortex—is missing. The about 1000-fold increase in number of neurons is the most obvious evolutionary change of neuronal network properties from mouse to human. Whether the structure of the local cortical circuitry has changed as well is, however, unclear. Recent data from transcriptomic analyses has indicated an increase in the proportion of inhibitory interneurons from mouse to human. But what the effect of such a change is on the circuit configurations found in the human cerebral cortex is not known. This is, however, of particular interest also to the study of neuropsychiatric disorders because in these, the alteration of inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic balance has been identified as one possible mechanistic underpinning. RATIONALE We used recent methodological improvements in connectomics to acquire data from one macaque and two human individuals, using biopsies of the temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex. Human tissue was obtained from neurosurgical interventions related to tumor removal, in which access path tissue was harvested that was not primarily affected by the underlying disease. A key concern in the analysis of human patient tissue has been the relation to epilepsy surgery, when the underlying disease has required often year-long treatment with pharmaceuticals, plausibly altering synaptic connectivity. Therefore, the analysis of nonepileptic surgery tissue seemed of particular importance. We also included data from one macaque individual, who was not known to have any brain-related pathology. RESULTS We acquired three-dimensional electron microscopy data from temporal and frontal cortex of human and temporal and parietal cortex of macaque. From these, we obtained connectomic reconstructions and compared these with five connectomes from mouse cortex. On the basis of these data, we were able to determine the effect of the about 2.5-fold expansion of the interneuron pool in macaque and human cortex compared with that of mouse. Contrary to expectation, the inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic balance on pyramidal neurons in macaque and human cortex was not substantially altered. Rather, the interneuron pool was selectively expanded for bipolar-type interneurons, which prefer the innervation of other interneurons, and which further increased their preference for interneuron innervation from mouse to human. These changes were each multifold, yielding in effect an about 10-fold expanded interneuron-to-interneuron network in the human cortex that is only sparsely present in mouse. The total amount of synaptic input to pyramidal neurons, however, did not change according to the threefold thickening of the cortex; rather, a modest increase from about 12,000 synaptic inputs in mouse to about 15,000 in human was found. CONCLUSION The principal cells of the cerebral cortex, pyramidal neurons, maintain almost constant inhibitory-to-excitatory input balance and total synaptic input across 100 million years of evolutionary divergence, which is particularly noteworthy with the concomitant 1000-fold expansion of the neuronal network size and the 2.5-fold increase of inhibitory interneurons from mouse to human. Rather, the key network change from mouse to human is an expansion of almost an order of magnitude of an interneuron-to-interneuron network that is virtually absent in mouse but constitutes a substantial part of the human cortical network. Whether this new network is primarily created through the expansion of existing neuronal types, or is related to the creation of new interneuron subtypes, requires further study. The discovery of this network component in human cortex encourages detailed analysis of its function in health and disease.

Smith, P. Scott",2020,"Here, a novel energy trading system is proposed for demand-side management of a neighborhood area network (NAN) consisting of a shared energy storage (SES) provider, users with non-dispatchable energy generation, and an electricity retailer. In a leader–follower Stackelberg game, the SES provider first maximizes their revenue by setting a price signal and trading energy with the grid. Then, by following the SES provider's actions, the retailer minimizes social cost for the users, i.e., the sum of the total users’ cost when they interact with the SES and the total cost for supplying grid energy to the users. A pricing strategy, which incorporates mechanism design, is proposed to make the system incentive-compatible by rewarding users who disclose true energy usage information.

In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini.

Perez",2022,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) reflects impairments in brain networks leading to distressing motor, sensory, and/or cognitive symptoms that demonstrate positive clinical signs on examination incongruent with other conditions. A central issue in historical and contemporary formulations of FND has been the mechanistic and etiological role of emotions. However, the debate has mostly omitted fundamental questions about the nature of emotions in the first place. In this perspective article, we first outline a set of relevant working principles of the brain (e.g., allostasis, predictive processing, interoception, and affect), followed by a focused review of the theory of constructed emotion to introduce a new understanding of what emotions are. Building on this theoretical framework, we formulate how altered emotion category construction can be an integral component of the pathophysiology of FND and related functional somatic symptoms. In doing so, we address several themes for the FND field including: 1) how energy regulation and the process of emotion category construction relate to symptom generation, including revisiting alexithymia, ""panic attack without panic"", dissociation, insecure attachment, and the influential role of life experiences; 2) re-interpret select neurobiological research findings in FND cohorts through the lens of the theory of constructed emotion to illustrate its potential mechanistic relevance; and 3) discuss therapeutic implications. While we continue to support that FND is mechanistically and etiologically heterogenous, consideration of how the theory of constructed emotion relates to the generation and maintenance of functional neurological and functional somatic symptoms offers an integrated viewpoint that cuts across neurology, psychiatry, psychology, and cognitive-affective neuroscience.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41d9b3eb97695ef2b4218573bddb66e0f27877f4,https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-pdf/145/8/2648/49120115/awac204.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41d9b3eb97695ef2b4218573bddb66e0f27877f4,Brain : a journal of neurology,"Medicine, Psychology",101,a22d0fe84e5c1374d4c95b8a6396a8d9,10.1093/brain/awac204,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

However, limited computation power of MR headset-mounted devices (HMDs) hinders the deployment of such services. Therefore, we propose an efficient information-sharing scheme based on full-duplex device-to-device (D2D) semantic communications to address this issue. Our approach enables users to avoid heavy and repetitive computational tasks, such as artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) in the view images of all MR users. Specifically, a user can transmit the generated content and semantic information extracted from their view image to nearby users, who can then use this information to obtain the spatial matching of computation results under their view images. We analyze the performance of full-duplex D2D communications, including the achievable rate and bit error probability, by using generalized small-scale fading models. To facilitate semantic information sharing among users, we design a contract theoretic AI-generated incentive mechanism. The proposed diffusion model generates the optimal contract design, outperforming two deep reinforcement learning algorithms, i.e., proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic algorithms.

We consider two natural notions of incentive compatibility in this setting: maximal incentive compatibility requires that no strategy has larger expected utility than reporting truthfully for all beliefs, while optimal incentive compatibility requires that reporting truthfully has larger expected utility than all other strategies for all beliefs. In a model with a continuum of types, we show that optimal incentive compatibility is equivalent to ex-post incentive compatibility under fairly general conditions on beliefs.

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used to analyze high-dimensional count data because, in contrast to real-valued alternatives such as factor analysis, it produces an interpretable parts-based representation. However, in applications such as spatial transcriptomics, NMF fails to incorporate known structure between observations. Here, we present nonnegative spatial factorization (NSF), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity and scales to tens of thousands of observations. NSF recovers ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued alternatives such as MEFISTO in simulations, and has lower out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic NMF on three spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver. Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of NSF that combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling quantification of spatial importance for both observations and features.

There are currently two main approaches to characterizing functional integration. The first is a mechanistic modeling of connectomics in terms of directed effective connectivity that mediates neuronal message passing and dynamics on neuronal circuits. The second phenomenological approach usually characterizes undirected functional connectivity (i.e., measurable correlations), in terms of intrinsic brain networks, self-organized criticality, dynamical instability, and so on. This paper describes a treatment of effective connectivity that speaks to the emergence of intrinsic brain networks and critical dynamics. It is predicated on the notion of Markov blankets that play a fundamental role in the self-organization of far from equilibrium systems.

Captured by different sensors, the images from different modalities often contain many distinct features, which makes it challenging to find their accurate correspondences. With the success of deep learning, many deep networks have been proposed to align multi-modal images, however, they are mostly lack of interpretability. In this paper, we first model the multi-modal image registration problem as a disentangled convolutional sparse coding (DCSC) model. In this model, the multi-modal features that are responsible for alignment (RA features) are well separated from the features that are not responsible for alignment (nRA features). By only allowing the RA features to participate in the deformation field prediction, we can eliminate the interference of the nRA features to improve the registration accuracy and efficiency. The optimization process of the DCSC model to separate the RA and nRA features is then turned into a deep network, namely Interpretable Multi-modal Image Registration Network (InMIR-Net). To ensure the accurate separation of RA and nRA features, we further design an accompanying guidance network (AG-Net) to supervise the extraction of RA features in InMIR-Net. The advantage of InMIR-Net is that it provides a universal framework to tackle both rigid and non-rigid multi-modal image registration tasks. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method on both rigid and non-rigid registrations on various multi-modal image datasets, including RGB/depth images, RGB/near-infrared (NIR) images, RGB/multi-spectral images, T1/T2 weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and computed tomography (CT)/MR images.

Sughrue",2021,"The surgical management of brain tumors is based on the principle that the extent of resection improves patient outcomes. Traditionally, neurosurgeons have considered that lesions in “non-eloquent” cerebrum can be more aggressively surgically managed compared to lesions in “eloquent” regions with more known functional relevance. Furthermore, advancements in multimodal imaging technologies have improved our ability to extend the rate of resection while minimizing the risk of inducing new neurologic deficits, together referred to as the “onco-functional balance.” However, despite the common utilization of invasive techniques such as cortical mapping to identify eloquent tissue responsible for language and motor functions, glioma patients continue to present post-operatively with poor cognitive morbidity in higher-order functions. Such observations are likely related to the difficulty in interpreting the highly-dimensional information these technologies present to us regarding cognition in addition to our classically poor understanding of the functional and structural neuroanatomy underlying complex higher-order cognitive functions. Furthermore, reduction of the brain into isolated cortical regions without consideration of the complex, interacting brain networks which these regions function within to subserve higher-order cognition inherently prevents our successful navigation of true eloquent and non-eloquent cerebrum. Fortunately, recent large-scale movements in the neuroscience community, such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), have provided updated neural data detailing the many intricate macroscopic connections between cortical regions which integrate and process the information underlying complex human behavior within a brain “connectome.” Connectomic data can provide us better maps on how to understand convoluted cortical and subcortical relationships between tumor and human cerebrum such that neurosurgeons can begin to make more informed decisions during surgery to maximize the onco-functional balance. However, connectome-based neurosurgery and related applications for neurorehabilitation are relatively nascent and require further work moving forward to optimize our ability to add highly valuable connectomic data to our surgical armamentarium. In this manuscript, we review four concepts with detailed examples which will help us better understand post-operative cognitive outcomes and provide a guide for how to utilize connectomics to reduce cognitive morbidity following cerebral surgery.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79aa20aa8cf9546b87e694078581e02d6637f86a,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.711646/pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79aa20aa8cf9546b87e694078581e02d6637f86a,Frontiers in Neurology,"Medicine, Medicine, Psychology",61,e26c187369f3f43944783d2070633188,10.3389/fneur.2021.711646,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Sarnthein",2020,"Deciphering the mechanisms of human memory is a central goal of neuroscience, both from the point of view of the fundamental biology of memory and for its translational relevance. Here, we review some contributions that recordings from neurons in humans implanted with electrodes for clinical purposes have made toward this goal. Recordings from the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, reveal the existence of two classes of cells: those encoding highly selective and invariant representations of abstract concepts, and memory-selective cells whose activity is related to familiarity and episodic retrieval. Insights derived from observing these cells in behaving humans include that semantic representations are activated before episodic representations, that memory content and memory strength are segregated, and that the activity of both types of cells is related to subjective awareness as expected from a substrate for declarative memory. Visually selective cells can remain persistently active for several seconds, thereby revealing a cellular substrate for working memory in humans. An overarching insight is that the neural code of human memory is interpretable at the single-neuron level. Jointly, intracranial recording studies are starting to reveal aspects of the building blocks of human memory at the single-cell level. This work establishes a bridge to cellular-level work in animals on the one hand, and the extensive literature on noninvasive imaging in humans on the other hand. More broadly, this work is a step toward a detailed mechanistic understanding of human memory that is needed to develop therapies for human memory disorders.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9854f38388b01991f461a25fefd1f67fecb9731f,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/41/5/883.full.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9854f38388b01991f461a25fefd1f67fecb9731f,Journal of Neuroscience,"Medicine, Biology",57,ffce458267bc401455e35aa57197a0e9,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1648-20.2020,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Connolly",2022,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are recognised both as damaging molecules and intracellular signalling entities. In addition to its role in ATP generation, the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) constitutes a relevant source of mitochondrial ROS, in particular during pathological conditions. Mitochondrial ROS homeostasis depends on species- and site-dependent ROS production, their bioreactivity, diffusion, and scavenging. However, our quantitative understanding of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis has thus far been hampered by technical limitations, including lack of truly site- and/or ROS-specific reporter molecules. In this context, the use of computational models is of great value to complement and interpret empirical data, as well as to predict variables that are difficult to assess experimentally. During the last decades, various mechanistic models of ETC-mediated ROS production have been developed. Although these often-complex models have generated novel insights, their parameterisation, analysis, and integration with other computational models is not straightforward. In contrast, phenomenological (sometimes termed ""minimal"") models use a relatively small set of equations to describe empirical relationship(s) between ROS-related and other parameters, and generally aim to explore system behaviour and generate hypotheses for experimental validation. In this review, we first discuss ETC-linked ROS homeostasis and introduce various detailed mechanistic models. Next, we present how bioenergetic parameters (e.g. NADH/NAD+ ratio, mitochondrial membrane potential) relate to site-specific ROS production within the ETC and how these relationships can be used to design minimal models of ROS homeostasis. Finally, we illustrate how minimal models have been applied to explore pathophysiological aspects of ROS.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85245be0c3b0ad078a440ab40da82f1f5edbdca5,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Mechanisms_and_mathematical_modeling_of_ROS_production_by_the_mitochondrial_electron_transport_chain/20308254/1/files/36272712.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85245be0c3b0ad078a440ab40da82f1f5edbdca5,American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology,"Medicine, Mathematics, Medicine",56,1a1ddb8e840f90dc765583768b6ce610,10.1152/ajpcell.00455.2021,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

7748391c938dc6f6a5bae6ac56f33faf37686714,The rotational and divergent components of atmospheric circulation on tidally locked planets,"M. Hammond, N. Lewis",2021,"Significance Tidally locked exoplanets have a permanent day side and night side. Understanding the atmospheric circulation on these planets is crucial for interpreting telescope observations and assessing their habitability. We show that the main components of the circulation—a jet going around the planet, stationary atmospheric waves, and direct flow from the day side to the night side—can be separated using a simple mathematical decomposition. This decomposition will significantly aid future study of tidally locked atmospheres. As an illustration, we use it to quantify heat transport due to different components of the circulation. This analysis reveals that the direct day–night component can dominate heat transport from the day side to the night side, even when the jet is strong. Tidally locked exoplanets likely host global atmospheric circulations with a superrotating equatorial jet, planetary-scale stationary waves, and thermally driven overturning circulation. In this work, we show that each of these features can be separated from the total circulation by using a Helmholtz decomposition, which splits the circulation into rotational (divergence-free) and divergent (vorticity-free) components. This technique is applied to the simulated circulation of a terrestrial planet and a gaseous hot Jupiter. For both planets, the rotational component comprises the equatorial jet and stationary waves, and the divergent component contains the overturning circulation. Separating out each component allows us to evaluate their spatial structure and relative contribution to the total flow. In contrast with previous work, we show that divergent velocities are not negligible when compared with rotational velocities and that divergent, overturning circulation takes the form of a single, roughly isotropic cell that ascends on the day side and descends on the night side. These conclusions are drawn for both the terrestrial case and the hot Jupiter. To illustrate the utility of the Helmholtz decomposition for studying atmospheric processes, we compute the contribution of each of the circulation components to heat transport from day side to night side. Surprisingly, we find that the divergent circulation dominates day–night heat transport in the terrestrial case and accounts for around half of the heat transport for the hot Jupiter. The relative contributions of the rotational and divergent components to day–night heat transport are likely sensitive to multiple planetary parameters and atmospheric processes and merit further study.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7748391c938dc6f6a5bae6ac56f33faf37686714,https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2022705118,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7748391c938dc6f6a5bae6ac56f33faf37686714,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Medicine, Physics, Physics, Environmental Science",48,abff31af6dcd5fe122dec99d8ade4088,10.1073/pnas.2022705118,2102.11760,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Taylor, Nicholas Goldowsky-Dill, Lee Sharkey",2024,"Identifying the features learned by neural networks is a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse, overcomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations, have been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about the structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network. There is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in these dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose end-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that ensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a Pareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total features, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all with no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative differences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary learning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior concisely and accurately.

Previous work assigned debaters/consultants an answer to argue for.

Steinbach",2021,"Developing a signal compression technique that is able to achieve a low bit rate while maintaining high perceptual signal quality is a classical signal processing problem vigorously studied for audio, speech, image, and video type of signals. Yet, until recently, there has been limited effort directed toward the compression of vibrotactile signals, which represent a crucial element of rich touch (haptic) information. A vibrotactile signal; produced when stroking a textured surface with a tool-tip or bare-finger; like other signals contains a great deal of redundant and imperceptible information that can be exploited for efficient compression. This paper presents PVC-SLP, a vibrotactile perceptual coding approach. PVC-SLP employs a model of tactile sensitivity; called ASF (Acceleration Sensitivity Function); for perceptual coding. The ASF is inspired by the four channels model that mediate the perception of vibrotactile stimuli in the glabrous skin. The compression algorithm introduces sparsity constraints in a linear prediction scheme both on the residual and the predictor coefficients. The perceptual quantization of the residual is developed through the use of ASF. The quantization parameters of the residual and the predictor coefficients were jointly optimized; by means of both squared error and perceptual quality measures; to find the sweet spot of the rate-distortion curve. PVC-SLP coding performance is evaluated using two publicly available databases that collectively comprise 1281 vibrotactile signals covering 193 material classes. Furthermore, we compare PVC-SLP with a recent vibrotactile compression method and show that PVC-SLP perceptually outperforms existing method by a sizable margin.

Saagi, Matthew John Wade, Jun‐Jie Zhu, E. Torfs",2022,"Mathematical modelling is an indispensable tool to support water resource recovery facility (WRRF) operators and engineers with the ambition of creating a truly circular economy and assuring a sustainable future. Despite the successful application of mechanistic models in the water sector, they show some important limitations and do not fully profit from the increasing digitalisation of systems and processes. Recent advances in data-driven methods have provided options for harnessing the power of Industry 4.0, but they are often limited by the lack of interpretability and extrapolation capabilities. Hybrid modelling (HM) combines these two modelling paradigms and aims to leverage both the rapidly increasing volumes of data collected, as well as the continued pursuit of greater process understanding. Despite the potential of HM in a sector that is undergoing a significant digital and cultural transformation, the application of hybrid models remains vague.

Singh, Ted Moskovitz, Felix Hill, S. C. Chan, Andrew M. Saxe",2024,"In-context learning is a powerful emergent ability in transformer models. Prior work in mechanistic interpretability has identified a circuit element that may be critical for in-context learning -- the induction head (IH), which performs a match-and-copy operation. During training of large transformers on natural language data, IHs emerge around the same time as a notable phase change in the loss. Despite the robust evidence for IHs and this interesting coincidence with the phase change, relatively little is known about the diversity and emergence dynamics of IHs. Why is there more than one IH, and how are they dependent on each other? Why do IHs appear all of a sudden, and what are the subcircuits that enable them to emerge? We answer these questions by studying IH emergence dynamics in a controlled setting by training on synthetic data. In doing so, we develop and share a novel optogenetics-inspired causal framework for modifying activations throughout training. Using this framework, we delineate the diverse and additive nature of IHs. By clamping subsets of activations throughout training, we then identify three underlying subcircuits that interact to drive IH formation, yielding the phase change. Furthermore, these subcircuits shed light on data-dependent properties of formation, such as phase change timing, already showing the promise of this more in-depth understanding of subcircuits that need to""go right""for an induction head.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63a87feede94433b44b2c2b194e5902c3c5158f2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07129.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63a87feede94433b44b2c2b194e5902c3c5158f2,International Conference on Machine Learning,Computer Science,41,160d0353f52a1dccf893bdae96e30380,10.48550/arXiv.2404.07129,2404.07129,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:28.524693+00:00,2025-09-29 20:02:01.691828+00:00

This question has been termed the scalable oversight problem and has drawn increasing attention as language models have continually improved. In this paper, we present the surprising conclusion that current pretrained language models often generalize relatively well from easy to hard data, even performing as well as oracle models finetuned on hard data. We demonstrate this kind of easy-to-hard generalization using simple finetuning methods like in-context learning, linear classifier heads, and QLoRA for seven different measures of datapoint hardness, including six empirically diverse human hardness measures (like grade level) and one model-based measure (loss-based). Furthermore, we show that even if one cares most about model performance on hard data, it can be better to collect easy data rather than hard data for finetuning, since hard data is generally noisier and costlier to collect. Our experiments use open models up to 70b in size and four publicly available question-answering datasets with questions ranging in difficulty from 3rd grade science questions to college level STEM questions and general-knowledge trivia. We conclude that easy-to-hard generalization in LMs is surprisingly strong for the tasks studied.

Dragotti",2022,"Convolutional dictionary learning has become increasingly popular in signal and image processing for its ability to overcome the limitations of traditional patch-based dictionary learning. Although most studies on convolutional dictionary learning mainly focus on the unimodal case, real-world image processing tasks usually involve images from multiple modalities, e.g., visible and near-infrared (NIR) images. Thus, it is necessary to explore convolutional dictionary learning across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal convolutional dictionary learning algorithm, which efficiently correlates different image modalities and fully considers neighborhood information at the image level. In this model, each modality is represented by two convolutional dictionaries, in which one dictionary is for common feature representation and the other is for unique feature representation. The model is constrained by the requirement that the convolutional sparse representations (CSRs) for the common features should be the same across different modalities, considering that these images are captured from the same scene. We propose a new training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to alternatively learn the common and unique dictionaries in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain. We show that our model converges in less than 20 iterations between the convolutional dictionary updating and the CSRs calculation. The effectiveness of the proposed dictionary learning algorithm is demonstrated on various multimodal image processing tasks, achieves better performance than both dictionary learning methods and deep learning based methods with limited training data.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d460fc6b6999a27d1f1d779195e9bfa47abe2960,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d460fc6b6999a27d1f1d779195e9bfa47abe2960,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,"Computer Science, Medicine, Computer Science, Environmental Science",39,e087496c780892e3207eb83d96645f87,10.1109/TIP.2022.3141251,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Välimäki, Timo Gerkmann",2024,"With the development of audio playback devices and fast data transmission, the demand for high sound quality is rising for both entertainment and communications. In this quest for better sound quality, challenges emerge from distortions and interferences originating at the recording side or caused by an imperfect transmission pipeline. To address this problem, audio restoration methods aim to recover clean sound signals from the corrupted input data. We present here audio restoration algorithms based on diffusion models, with a focus on speech enhancement and music restoration tasks. Traditional approaches, often grounded in handcrafted rules and statistical heuristics, have shaped our understanding of audio signals. In the past decades, there has been a notable shift toward data-driven methods that exploit the modeling capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs). Deep generative models, and among them diffusion models, have emerged as powerful techniques for learning complex data distributions. However, relying solely on DNN-based learning approaches carries the risk of reducing interpretability, particularly when employing end-to-end models. Nonetheless, data-driven approaches allow more flexibility in comparison to statistical model-based frameworks, whose performance depends on distributional and statistical assumptions that can be difficult to guarantee. Here, we aim to show that diffusion models can combine the best of both worlds and offer the opportunity to design audio restoration algorithms with a good degree of interpretability and a remarkable performance in terms of sound quality. In this article, we review the use of diffusion models for audio restoration. We explain the diffusion formalism and its application to the conditional generation of clean audio signals. We believe that diffusion models open an exciting field of research with the potential to spawn new audio restoration algorithms that are natural-sounding and remain robust in difficult acoustic situations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2befe6e08c33c72a62d779759076d2c7ab9f410a,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09821.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2befe6e08c33c72a62d779759076d2c7ab9f410a,IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,"Computer Science, Engineering, Computer Science, Engineering",37,e188cd7a5af5364280ca4c2fd54355b5,10.1109/MSP.2024.3445871,2402.09821,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Despite the unprecedented ability of these artificial neural networks (ANNs) to capture responses in biological neural networks (brains), and our full access to all internal model components (unlike the brain), ANNs are often referred to as black-boxes with limited interpretability. Interpretability, however, is a multi-faceted construct that is used differently across fields. In particular, interpretability, or explainability, efforts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) focus on understanding how different model components contribute to its output (i.e., decision making). In contrast, the neuroscientific interpretability of ANNs requires explicit alignment between model components and neuroscientific constructs (e.g., different brain areas or phenomena, like recurrence or top-down feedback). Given the widespread calls to improve the interpretability of AI systems, we here highlight these different notions of interpretability and argue that the neuroscientific interpretability of ANNs can be pursued in parallel with, but independently from, the ongoing efforts in AI. Certain ML techniques (e.g., deep dream) can be leveraged in both fields, to ask what stimulus optimally activates the specific model features (feature visualization by optimization), or how different features contribute to the model's output (feature attribution). However, without appropriate brain alignment, certain features will remain uninterpretable to neuroscientists.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d47b8a502d8bd776fc52a2b9785c03fa1c8f080,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03951,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d47b8a502d8bd776fc52a2b9785c03fa1c8f080,Nat.

Kozachkov, I. Fiete",2023,"How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

We formulate this question as a Bayesian-optimal mechanism design problem, in which an individual can share her (verifiable) data in exchange for a monetary reward or services, but at the same time has a (private) heterogeneous privacy cost which we quantify using differential privacy. We consider two popular differential privacy settings for providing privacy guarantees for the users: central and local. In both settings, we establish minimax lower bounds for the estimation error and derive (near) optimal estimators for given heterogeneous privacy loss levels for users. Building on this characterization, we pose the mechanism design problem as the optimal selection of an estimator and payments that will elicit truthful reporting of users' privacy sensitivities. Under a regularity condition on the distribution of privacy sensitivities we develop efficient algorithmic mechanisms to solve this problem in both privacy settings. Our mechanism in the central setting can be implemented in time O (n log n) where n is the number of users and our mechanism in the local setting admits a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS).

We introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models on their verification abilities.

Current detection methods often focus on one of these mechanisms or without decoupling their intertwined effects, making accurate detection difficult. In this paper, we investigate the internal mechanisms behind hallucinations in RAG scenarios. We discover hallucinations occur when the Knowledge FFNs in LLMs overemphasize parametric knowledge in the residual stream, while Copying Heads fail to effectively retain or integrate external knowledge from retrieved content. Based on these findings, we propose ReDeEP, a novel method that detects hallucinations by decoupling LLM's utilization of external context and parametric knowledge.

Brüningk",2023,"Mechanistic learning refers to the synergistic combination of mechanistic mathematical modeling and data-driven machine or deep learning. This emerging field finds increasing applications in (mathematical) oncology. This review aims to capture the current state of the field and provides a perspective on how mechanistic learning may progress in the oncology domain. We highlight the synergistic potential of mechanistic learning and point out similarities and differences between purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches concerning model complexity, data requirements, outputs generated, and interpretability of the algorithms and their results. Four categories of mechanistic learning (sequential, parallel, extrinsic, intrinsic) of mechanistic learning are presented with specific examples. We discuss a range of techniques including physics-informed neural networks, surrogate model learning, and digital twins. Example applications address complex problems predominantly from the domain of oncology research such as longitudinal tumor response predictions or time-to-event modeling. As the field of mechanistic learning advances, we aim for this review and proposed categorization framework to foster additional collaboration between the data- and knowledge-driven modeling fields.

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for decomposing the internal activations of trained transformers into sparse, interpretable features, and have been applied to MLP layers and the residual stream. In this work we train SAEs on attention layer outputs and show that also here SAEs find a sparse, interpretable decomposition. We demonstrate this on transformers from several model families and up to 2B parameters. We perform a qualitative study of the features computed by attention layers, and find multiple families: long-range context, short-range context and induction features. We qualitatively study the role of every head in GPT-2 Small, and estimate that at least 90% of the heads are polysemantic, i.e. have multiple unrelated roles. Further, we show that Sparse Autoencoders are a useful tool that enable researchers to explain model behavior in greater detail than prior work. For example, we explore the mystery of why models have so many seemingly redundant induction heads, use SAEs to motivate the hypothesis that some are long-prefix whereas others are short-prefix, and confirm this with more rigorous analysis. We use our SAEs to analyze the computation performed by the Indirect Object Identification circuit (Wang et al.), validating that the SAEs find causally meaningful intermediate variables, and deepening our understanding of the semantics of the circuit.

Yeh, S. Chiu",2020,"Background Advances in voice technology have raised new possibilities for apps related to daily health maintenance. However, the usability of such technologies for older users remains unclear and requires further investigation. Objective We designed and evaluated two innovative mobile voice-added apps for food intake reporting, namely voice-only reporting (VOR) and voice-button reporting (VBR). Each app features a unique interactive procedure for reporting food intake. With VOR, users verbally report the main contents of each dish, while VBR provides both voice and existing touch screen inputs for food intake reporting. The relative usability of the two apps was assessed through the metrics of accuracy, efficiency, and user perception. Methods The two mobile apps were compared in a head-to-head parallel randomized trial evaluation. A group of 57 adults aged 60-90 years (12 male and 45 female participants) was recruited from a retirement community and randomized into two experimental groups, that is, VOR (n=30) and VBR (n=27) groups. Both groups were tested using the same set of 17 food items including dishes and beverages selected and allocated to present distinct breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals. All participants used a 7-inch tablet computer for the test. The resulting data were analyzed to evaluate reporting accuracy and time efficiency, and the system usability scale (SUS) was used to measure user perception. Results For eight error types identified in the experiment, the VBR group participants were significantly (P<.001) more error prone owing to the required use of button-tapping actions. The highest error rates in the VOR group were related to incomprehensible reporting speech (28/420, 6.7%), while the highest error rates in the VBR group were related to failure to make required button taps (39/378, 10.3%). The VOR group required significantly (P<.001) less time to complete food reporting. The overall subjective reactions of the two groups based on the SUS surpassed the benchmark and were not significantly different (P=.20). Conclusions Experimental results showed that VOR outperformed VBR, suggesting that voice-only food input reporting is preferable for elderly users. Voice-added apps offer a potential mechanism for the self-management of dietary intake by elderly users. Our study contributes an evidence-based evaluation of prototype design and selection under a user-centered design model. The results provide a useful reference for selecting optimal user interaction design.

Veneris",2021,"Blockchain systems rely on oracles to bridge external information to the decentralized applications residing in the systems. Astraea protocols are decentralized oracle designs utilizing majority‐voting mechanism to determine the oracle outcomes and/or rewards to voters. However, the voters are indifferent between voting through a single or multiple identities, as the potential rewards by the decentralized oracles grow linearly with the voters stakes. Additionally, the majority‐voting mechanism may facilitate herd behaviors among the voters, as the voters are rewarded only if they are in agreement with the majority outcomes. In this paper, a novel oracle protocol is introduced by proposing a peer prediction‐based scoring scheme along with non‐linear staking rules, aiming at extracting subjective data truthfully. Specifically, an incentive compatible scoring scheme is designed so that voters uniquely maximize their expected score by honest reporting. The voters are rewarded when their report achieves a relatively high score compared to the rest of the voters, as opposed to the existing schemes, where a reward is only given when they agree to the majority. Furthermore, a non‐linear stake scaling rule is proposed to discourage Sybil attacks. Detailed simulation results are presented to show the operation of the proposed oracle protocol and its improvement compared to indicative mechanisms proposed in the existing literature.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46a9b9f04d1b8a9b8f973d65a4be80cef563ce7f,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46a9b9f04d1b8a9b8f973d65a4be80cef563ce7f,International Journal of Network Management,"Computer Science, Computer Science",29,2d3762f9bdb38b75033844c0d57d0043,10.1002/nem.2179,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Quality-aware crowdsourcing is beneficial as it makes use of workers’ data quality to perform task allocation and data aggregation. However, a worker’s quality and data can be her private information that she may have incentive to misreport to the crowdsourcing requester. Moreover, a worker’s quality and data can depend on her sensitive information (e.g., location), which can be inferred from the outcomes of task allocation and data aggregation by an adversary. In this paper, we devise Privacy-preserving crowdsourcing mechanisms for truthful Data Quality Elicitation (PDQE). In these mechanisms, we design differentially private task allocation and data aggregation algorithms to prevent the inference of a worker’s quality and data from the outcomes of these algorithms. In the meantime, the mechanisms also incentivize workers to truthfully report their quality and data and make desired efforts. We first focus on the mechanisms for a single task (S-PDQE) and then extend it to the case of multiple tasks (M-PDQE). We further show that both the mechanisms achieve a bounded performance gap compared to the optimal strategy. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms using simulations based on real-world data, which corroborate their highly-desired properties on truthful data quality elicitation, data accuracy and privacy protection.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/401547863bb0e25abc81f635c9e9320dd809a5a3,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmc.2020.3040138,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/401547863bb0e25abc81f635c9e9320dd809a5a3,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"Computer Science, Computer Science",29,3a3cc5a5569f2727fe51e49ecd0f0bfd,10.1109/tmc.2020.3040138,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Miao",2021,"Federated learning (FL) serves as a data privacy-preserved machine learning paradigm, and realizes the collaborative model trained by distributed clients. To accomplish an FL task, the task publisher needs to pay financial incentives to the FL server and FL server offloads the task to the contributing FL clients. It is challenging to design proper incentives for the FL clients due to the fact that the task is privately trained by the clients. This paper aims to propose a contract theory based FL task training model towards minimizing incentive budget subject to clients being individually rational (IR) and incentive compatible (IC) in each FL training round. We design a two-dimensional contract model by formally defining two private types of clients, namely data quality and computation effort. To effectively aggregate the trained models, a contract-based aggregator is proposed. We analyze the feasible and optimal contract solutions to the proposed contract model. %Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework and contract model can effective improve the generation accuracy of FL tasks.

To overcome the problem, a new strong-noise elimination method called IncepTCN-SISC is proposed based on deep learning and dictionary learning. First, a novel deep neural network (DNN) model called IncepTCN is created based on the Inception block and temporal convolutional network (TCN). Then, we employ IncepTCN to recognize the strong-noise segments from the observed signal, which will be discarded later. Finally, a dictionary learning method based on shift-invariant convolutional coding is used to denoise the remaining weak-noise segments. Through a series of simulated and field data experiments, we find that the new proposed IncepTCN network has obvious advantages over the comparison methods in accuracy and efficiency. The average recognition accuracy of IncepTCN is 96.5%, which is 25.5%, 3.2%, 1.1%, and 2.0% higher than that of the fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM), convolutional neural network (CNN), residual network (ResNet), and the non-improved TCN, respectively. In addition, the test results of unfamiliar data show that the generalization ability of IncepTCN is significantly better than the CNN, ResNet, and non-improved TCN. The proposed IncepTCN-SISC method can improve the SNR of CSEM data from -5.0 dB to 3.1 dB or from 5.0 dB to 31.9 dB and solve the denoising problem of noisy data below 0 dB to a certain extent. After IncepTCN-SISC processing, the initially distorted apparent resistivity curves become smooth, and the result is better than dictionary learning.

61393e6ad8262f2fbf1ef980608c3deae5fb1afd,Is This the Subspace You Are Looking for? An Interpretability Illusion for Subspace Activation Patching,"Aleksandar Makelov, Georg Lange, Neel Nanda",2023,"Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand model behaviors in terms of specific, interpretable features, often hypothesized to manifest as low-dimensional subspaces of activations. Specifically, recent studies have explored subspace interventions (such as activation patching) as a way to simultaneously manipulate model behavior and attribute the features behind it to given subspaces. In this work, we demonstrate that these two aims diverge, potentially leading to an illusory sense of interpretability. Counterintuitively, even if a subspace intervention makes the model's output behave as if the value of a feature was changed, this effect may be achieved by activating a dormant parallel pathway leveraging another subspace that is causally disconnected from model outputs. We demonstrate this phenomenon in a distilled mathematical example, in two real-world domains (the indirect object identification task and factual recall), and present evidence for its prevalence in practice. In the context of factual recall, we further show a link to rank-1 fact editing, providing a mechanistic explanation for previous work observing an inconsistency between fact editing performance and fact localization. However, this does not imply that activation patching of subspaces is intrinsically unfit for interpretability. To contextualize our findings, we also show what a success case looks like in a task (indirect object identification) where prior manual circuit analysis informs an understanding of the location of a feature. We explore the additional evidence needed to argue that a patched subspace is faithful.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61393e6ad8262f2fbf1ef980608c3deae5fb1afd,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17030.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61393e6ad8262f2fbf1ef980608c3deae5fb1afd,International Conference on Learning Representations,"Computer Science, Computer Science",28,029b8855b7abb4e8428dae1b3c5fd935,10.48550/arXiv.2311.17030,2311.17030,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:30.572060+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:30.572060+00:00

Tsang",2020,"This paper concerns the mechanism design for online resource allocation in a strategic setting. In this setting, a single supplier allocates capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request. The supplier charges payment from agents whose requests are satisfied, but incurs a load-dependent supply cost. The goal is to design an incentive compatible online mechanism, which determines not only the resource allocation of each request, but also the payment of each agent, so as to (approximately) maximize the social welfare (i.e., aggregate valuations minus supply cost). We study this problem under the framework of competitive analysis. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a unified approach that achieves the best-possible competitive ratios for setups with different supply costs. Specifically, we show that when there is no supply cost or the supply cost function is linear, our model is essentially a standard 0-1 knapsack problem, for which our approach achieves logarithmic competitive ratios that match the state-of-the-art (which is optimal). For the more challenging setup when the supply cost is strictly-convex, we provide online mechanisms, for the first time, that lead to the optimal competitive ratios as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that unifies the characterization of optimal competitive ratios in online resource allocation for different setups including zero, linear and strictly-convex supply costs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6de99d573117e61a417add707b9fe2ccc2964160,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09640.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6de99d573117e61a417add707b9fe2ccc2964160,Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems,"Computer Science, Economics, Computer Science",27,5847f994a3914cdc4a6a416ed881788e,10.1145/3393691.3394201,2004.09640,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of research on EEG signal processing techniques since 2021, with a focus on preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification methods. We analyzed 61 research articles retrieved from academic search engines, including CNKI, PubMed, Nature, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct. For preprocessing, we focus on innovatively proposed preprocessing methods, channel selection, and data augmentation. Data augmentation is classified into conventional methods (sliding windows, segmentation and recombination, and noise injection) and deep learning methods [Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variation AutoEncoder (VAE)]. We also pay attention to the application of deep learning, and multi-method fusion approaches, including both conventional algorithm fusion and fusion between conventional algorithms and deep learning. Our analysis identifies 35 (57.4%), 18 (29.5%), and 37 (60.7%) studies in the directions of preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, respectively. We find that preprocessing methods have become widely used in EEG classification (96.7% of reviewed papers) and comparative experiments have been conducted in some studies to validate preprocessing. We also discussed the adoption of channel selection and data augmentation and concluded several mentionable matters about data augmentation. Furthermore, deep learning methods have shown great promise in EEG classification, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) being the main structure of deep neural networks (92.3% of deep learning papers). We summarize and analyze several innovative neural networks, including CNNs and multi-structure fusion. However, we also identified several problems and limitations of current deep learning techniques in EEG classification, including inappropriate input, low cross-subject accuracy, unbalanced between parameters and time costs, and a lack of interpretability.

Melodies were composed of ∼60 and ∼80 Hz tones embedded in a 2.5 Hz stream. Using intracranial and surface recordings in male and female humans, we reveal persistent oscillatory activity in the high-γ band in response to the tones throughout the cortex, well beyond auditory regions. By contrast, in response to the 2.5 Hz stream, no persistent activity in any frequency band was observed. We further show that our data are well captured by a model of damped harmonic oscillator and can be classified into three classes of neural dynamics, with distinct damping properties and eigenfrequencies. This model provides a mechanistic and quantitative explanation of the frequency selectivity of auditory neural entrainment in the human cortex. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT It has been proposed that the functional role of cortical oscillations is subtended by a mechanism of entrainment, the synchronization in phase or amplitude of neural oscillations to a periodic stimulation. One of the properties of neural entrainment that is often taken for granted is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. Using intracranial and surface recordings of humans passively listening to rhythmic auditory stimuli, we reveal consistent oscillatory responses throughout the cortex, with persistent activity of high-γ oscillations. On the contrary, neural oscillations do not outlast low-frequency acoustic dynamics. We interpret our results as reflecting harmonic oscillator properties, a model ubiquitous in physics but rarely used in neuroscience.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00927fa79a3e957c85110eed10dd4d3b5f64ef2a,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/41/38/7991.full.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00927fa79a3e957c85110eed10dd4d3b5f64ef2a,Journal of Neuroscience,"Medicine, Physics, Biology",26,0fde8d7a6931c98d4f06693f99cb7807,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0213-21.2021,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Instead, we use a smart contract written on blockchains as a commitment device. We design the digital court, a smart contract that identifies and punishes agents who reneged on the agreement. The digital court substitutes the role of legal enforcement in the traditional mechanism design paradigm. We show that, any agreement that is implementable with legal enforcement can also be implemented with enforcement by the digital court. To pursue a desirable design of the digital court, we study a way to leverage truthful reports made by a small fraction of behavioral agents. Our digital court has a unique equilibrium as long as there is a positive fraction of behavioral agents, and it gives correct judgment in the equilibrium if honest agents are more likely to exist than dishonest agents. The platform for smart contracts is already ready in 2020; thus, self-enforcing mechanisms proposed in this paper can be used practically, even now. As our digital court can be used for implementing general agreements, it does not leak the detailed information about the agreement even if it is deployed on a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) as a smart contract.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/602efd5876e780395d9f65a902d5caeea80e266f,http://www.cirje.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/research/dp/2020/2020cf1145.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/602efd5876e780395d9f65a902d5caeea80e266f,Social Science Research Network,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Law",25,dc9fc234b6e4984ce8598043ae5ce580,10.2139/ssrn.3554512,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Law'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Lui, Zongpeng Li",2021,"Federated Learning (FL) is a new distributed machine learning (ML) approach which enables thousands of mobile devices to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models using local data without compromising user privacy. Although FL represents a promising computing paradigm, such training process can not be fully realized without an appropriate economic mechanism that incentivizes the participation of heterogeneous clients. This work targets social cost minimization, and studies the incentive mechanism design in FL through a procurement auction. Different from existing literature, we consider a practical scenario of FL where clients are selected and scheduled at different global iterations to guarantee the completion of the FL job, and capture the distinct feature of FL that the number of global iterations is determined by the local accuracy of all participants to balance between computation and communication. Our auction framework $A_{FL}$ first decomposes the social cost minimization problem into a series of winner determination problems (WDPs) based on the number of global iterations. Then to solve each WDP, $A_{FL}$ invokes a greedy algorithm to determine the winners, and a payment algorithm for computing remuneration to winners. Finally, $A_{FL}$ returns the best solution among all WDPs. Theoretical analysis proves that $A_{FL}$ is truthful, individual rational, computationally efficient, and achieves a near-optimal social cost. We further conduct large-scale simulation studies based on the real-world data. Simulation results show that $A_{FL}$ can reduce the social cost by up to 75% compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f62e2383fbb1283125f35837f9b4b757db810bc,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f62e2383fbb1283125f35837f9b4b757db810bc,IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",25,98a742cc54058abd4be35c425663e0c3,10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00026,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Hussein, Sameh E. Ahmed, A. Arafa, A. Elshekhipy",2023,"Mathematical simulation of biological fluids is of upmost significance due to its numerous medical uses. Interpreting various biological flows necessitates a thorough knowledge of the peristaltic mechanism. This paper presents a computational study for the peristaltic pumping within vertical asymmetric channels filled with BN‐EG nanofluid under the influence of temperature‐dependent electrical conductivity and thermal radiation. Experimental study showed that the nanofluid created by suspending Boron Nitride particles in a combination of Ethylene Glycol exhibited non‐Newtonian characteristics. Further, the Carreau's fluid model provides accurate predictions about the rheological properties of BN‐EG nanofluid. Various configurations of the outer boundaries are considered, namely, square wave, multi‐sinusoidal wave, trapezoidal wave, and triangular wave. A uniform magnetic field together with nanoparticles and mass concentrations, joule heating, first‐order chemical reaction as well as viscous dissipation are considered. Influences of the Dufour and Soret numbers are examined, and the cases of biological scientific assumptions which is known as low Reynolds number and long wavelength are applied. All the computations are obtained numerically using Mathematica symbolical software (ND‐Solve), and the obtained results are presented in terms of the axial velocity u, heat transfer rate Z, concentration profile Ω, temperature profile θ, extra stress tensor Sxy${S}_{xy}$ , pressure gradient dpdx$\frac{{dp}}{{dx}}$ , pressure rise Δpλ${\mathrm{\Delta p}}_{{\lambda}}$ and stream function ψ.

Therefore, a novel interpretable deep denoising framework based on sparse representation is proposed in this study, and the half quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm is applied to decompose the denoising method into sparse representations as an iterative solution process. In addition, a new weight distribution (WD) module is designed to extract adaptive hyperparameters based on ECG correlation instead of empirical values and greatly improves the efficiency of hyperparameter selection.

First, we introduce the Age of Information (AoI) metric to measure the freshness of data. Then, we model the incentive mechanism design with AoI guarantees as a novel incomplete information two-stage Stackelberg game with multiple constraints. Next, we derive the optimal strategies of this game so as to determine the optimal reward paid by the platform and the optimal data update frequency for each worker. Moreover, we prove that these optimal strategies form a unique Stackelberg equilibrium. Based on the optimal strategies, we propose an AoI-Aware Incentive (AIAI) mechanism for the MCS system, whereby the platform and all workers can maximize their utilities simultaneously.

Using the Woodbury formula for NSRA can avoid the time‐consuming recalculation and factorization of the large‐dimensional global stiffness matrix of a structure by only solving a small‐dimensional Schur complement system representing local nonlinearity per iteration. Because the dimension of the Schur complement matrix is determined by the inelastic degree of freedom (IDOF) number, which represents the scale of local nonlinear regions, a small IDOF number is helpful for achieving the high‐efficiency advantage of the Woodbury formula. However, when performing NSRA for large‐scale structures, the IDOF number is usually relatively large, which contradicts the efficiency requirement of the Woodbury formula. To solve this problem and extend the advantage of the Woodbury formula to the NSRA of large‐scale structures, this paper first proposes a two‐stage IDOF number reduction method by eliminating the IDOFs that have insignificant effects on the results, and consequently, a variant Woodbury formula is derived. Because only the principal component in the Schur complement matrix is retained, the dimension of this matrix and the cost for factorizing it can be reduced significantly without losing accuracy, thus greatly improving the efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, to reduce the additional computational time introduced by the IDOF number reduction procedure and to further improve the computational performance of the proposed method, an OpenMP parallel computational strategy is incorporated. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by implementing incremental dynamic analysis for a large‐scale reinforced concrete structure.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/565a3dfb366b4304403fb86e5488f1c5f131d7df,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/565a3dfb366b4304403fb86e5488f1c5f131d7df,Earthquake Engineering &amp; Structural Dynamics,Engineering,24,5e0ab72cb73524ff5339d3fa4e663fc5,10.1002/eqe.4018,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

Dispersive and multimodal characteristics lead to complicated Lamb wave signals that are challenging to be analyzed. Deep learning architectures could identify damage-related features effectively. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a promising architecture that has been widely applied in recent years. However, this data-driven approach still lacks a certain degree of physical interpretability and requires a large number of parameters. In this article, an interpretable Lamb wave convolutional sparse coding (LW-CSC) method is proposed for structural damage identification and localization. First, toneburst signals at different center frequencies are considered in the first convolutional layer. The network convolves the waveforms with a set of parametrized functions that implement band-pass filters, which performs more physical interpretability compared to conventional CNN model. Subsequently, the damage features are extracted according to the multi-layer iterative soft thresholding algorithm for multi-layer CSC model, which could realize a deeper network without adding parameters unlike CNN. Finally, Lamb wave-based damage localization is visualized using an imaging algorithm.

A (direct-revelation) mechanism takes agents' reported valuations as input, and outputs an allocation that satisfies a given fairness requirement. A natural and fundamental open problem, first raised by Chen, Lai, Parkes, and Procaccia [22] and subsequently raised in reference [9 , 11 , 12 , 19, 33, 35], etc., is whether there exists a deterministic, truthful and envy-free (or even proportional) cake cutting mechanism. In this paper, we resolve this open problem by proving that there does not exist a deterministic, truthful and proportional cake cutting mechanism, even in the special case where all of the following hold: there are only two agents; each agent's valuation is a piecewise-constant function; each agent is hungry: each agent has a strictly positive value on any part of the cake. The impossibility result extends to the case where the mechanism is allowed to leave some part of the cake unallocated. To circumvent this impossibility result, we aim to design mechanisms that possess a certain degree of truthfulness. Motivated by the kind of truthfulness possessed by the classical I-cut-you-choose protocol, we propose a weaker notion of truthfulness, the proportional risk-averse truthfulness. We show that the well-known moving-knife (Dubins-Spanier) procedure and Even-Paz algorithm do not have this truthful property. We propose a mechanism that is proportionally risk-averse truthful and envy-free, and a mechanism that is proportionally risk-averse truthful that always outputs allocations with connected pieces.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c7663b65c8d56426085e6122260592df8fe4ceb,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07387.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c7663b65c8d56426085e6122260592df8fe4ceb,ACM Conference on Economics and Computation,"Computer Science, Economics",23,e8edc27680549aa1fe2ba8ecd4fd6db2,10.1145/3490486.3538321 10.1016/j.artint.2023.103904,2104.07387,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

To date, most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models, narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling all human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate descriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned models in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate and compare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (Function INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building blocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions that resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions of the kind we seek to generate. The functions span textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world complexities. We evaluate methods that use pretrained language models (LMs) to produce descriptions of function behavior in natural language and code. Additionally, we introduce a new interactive method in which an Automated Interpretability Agent (AIA) generates function descriptions. We find that an AIA, built from an LM with black-box access to functions, can infer function structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses, proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data. However, AIA descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss local details. These results suggest that FIND will be useful for evaluating more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are applied to real-world models.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47fff0f40e52d7ad55bdfcae690bef3f889453d6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03886.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47fff0f40e52d7ad55bdfcae690bef3f889453d6,Neural Information Processing Systems,"Computer Science, Computer Science",23,144e0f7270117451dcf96b84dfa77a8a,,2309.03886,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00

Ding, Zhisheng Gao, Chunzhi Xie",2023,"Infrared small target detection is widely used for early warning, aircraft monitoring, ship monitoring, and so on, which requires the small target and its background to be represented and modeled effectively to achieve their complete separation. Low-rank sparse decomposition based on the structural features of infrared images has attracted much attention among many algorithms because of its good interpretability. Based on our study, we found some shortcomings in existing baseline methods, such as redundancy of constructing tensors and fixed compromising factors. A self-adaptive low-rank sparse tensor decomposition model for infrared dim small target detection is proposed in this paper. In this model, the entropy of image block is used for fast matching of non-local similar blocks to construct a better sparse tensor for small targets. An adaptive strategy of low-rank sparse tensor decomposition is proposed for different background environments, which adaptively determines the weight coefficient to achieve effective separation of background and small targets in different background environments. Tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) was applied to achieve low-rank sparse tensor decomposition to reconstruct small targets and their backgrounds separately.

Schlagenhauf",2022,"To understand the dysfunctional mechanisms underlying maladaptive reasoning of psychosis, computational models of decision making have widely been applied over the past decade. Thereby, a particular focus has been on the degree to which beliefs are updated based on new evidence, expressed by the learning rate in computational models. Higher order beliefs about the stability of the environment can determine the attribution of meaningfulness to events that deviate from existing beliefs by interpreting these either as noise or as true systematic changes (volatility). Both, the inappropriate downplaying of important changes as noise (belief update too low) as well as the overly flexible adaptation to random events (belief update too high) were theoretically and empirically linked to symptoms of psychosis. Whereas models with fixed learning rates fail to adjust learning in reaction to dynamic changes, increasingly complex learning models have been adopted in samples with clinical and subclinical psychosis lately. These ranged from advanced reinforcement learning models, over fully Bayesian belief updating models to approximations of fully Bayesian models with hierarchical learning or change point detection algorithms. It remains difficult to draw comparisons across findings of learning alterations in psychosis modeled by different approaches e.g., the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter and change point detection. Therefore, this review aims to summarize and compare computational definitions and findings of dynamic belief updating without perceptual ambiguity in (sub)clinical psychosis across these different mathematical approaches. There was strong heterogeneity in tasks and samples. Overall, individuals with schizophrenia and delusion-proneness showed lower behavioral performance linked to failed differentiation between uninformative noise and environmental change. This was indicated by increased belief updating and an overestimation of volatility, which was associated with cognitive deficits. Correlational evidence for computational mechanisms and positive symptoms is still sparse and might diverge from the group finding of instable beliefs. Based on the reviewed studies, we highlight some aspects to be considered to advance the field with regard to task design, modeling approach, and inclusion of participants across the psychosis spectrum. Taken together, our review shows that computational psychiatry offers powerful tools to advance our mechanistic insights into the cognitive anatomy of psychotic experiences.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd1f0a74a79bbf46f8bbeaa6e21a35b9290f23a1,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.814111/pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd1f0a74a79bbf46f8bbeaa6e21a35b9290f23a1,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Medicine, Psychology",22,f8f4858aa2aab99e8f8c7f5c335244f1,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.814111,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Experimental results show that the proposed MCSCNet significantly advances the denoising performance, with an average PSNR improvement of 0.32 dB over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSC based method.

The connection patterns of neural circuits form a complex network. How signaling in these circuits manifests as complex cognition and adaptive behaviour remains the central question in neuroscience. Concomitant advances in connectomics and artificial intelligence open fundamentally new opportunities to understand how connection patterns shape computational capacity in biological brain networks. Reservoir computing is a versatile paradigm that uses high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical systems to perform computations and approximate cognitive functions.

A donor can donate either his smaller left lobe or the larger right lobe, although the former option is safer. Despite its elevated risk, right-lobe transplantation is often utilized due to size-compatibility requirement with the patient. We model liver exchange as a market-design problem, focusing on logistically simpler two-way exchanges. First, with two patient-donor sizes, we introduce an algorithm when only the safer left-lobe transplantation is feasible. We then introduce an individually rational, Pareto-efficient, and incentive-compatible mechanism that truthfully elicits the right- lobe-donation willingness of donors, and finally extend these results to a general model with any number of patient/donor sizes. The generalization requires new technical tools regarding bilateral exchanges under partial-order-induced preferences.

This paper proposes a technological model for standardizing digital financial services, aimed at bridging the gaps in regulatory oversight and enhancing service delivery. The model focuses on three core components: the harmonization of regulatory frameworks, the implementation of digital tools for real-time monitoring, and the adoption of secure, scalable technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced service traceability, transparency, and automation. By aligning Nigeria’s digital financial services with international best practices and customizing them to local market conditions, the model seeks to mitigate issues such as fraud, data privacy breaches, and uneven access to services, particularly among underserved populations. Furthermore, the model emphasizes the importance of collaboration between financial institutions, fintech companies, government agencies, and regulatory bodies to foster innovation and compliance. A phased implementation strategy is recommended, with initial efforts focused on the integration of digital platforms, the development of training programs for financial literacy, and the creation of awareness campaigns to promote consumer understanding of standardized services. The long-term benefits of this model include improved financial inclusion, enhanced consumer protection, and increased investor confidence in Nigeria’s digital financial ecosystem.

Schoenebeck, Fang-Yi Yu",2020,"Peer prediction mechanisms incentivize agents to truthfully report their signals even in the absence of verification by comparing agents' reports with those of their peers. In the detail-free multi-task setting, agents respond to multiple independent and identically distributed tasks, and the mechanism does not know the prior distribution of agents' signals. The goal is to provide an $\epsilon$-strongly truthful mechanism where truth-telling rewards agents ""strictly"" more than any other strategy profile (with $\epsilon$ additive error), and to do so while requiring as few tasks as possible. We design a family of mechanisms with a scoring function that maps a pair of reports to a score. The mechanism is strongly truthful if the scoring function is ""prior ideal,"" and $\epsilon$-strongly truthful as long as the scoring function is sufficiently close to the ideal one. This reduces the above mechanism design problem to a learning problem -- specifically learning an ideal scoring function. We leverage this reduction to obtain the following three results. 1) We show how to derive good bounds on the number of tasks required for different types of priors. Our reduction applies to myriad continuous signal space settings. This is the first peer-prediction mechanism on continuous signals designed for the multi-task setting. 2) We show how to turn a soft-predictor of an agent's signals (given the other agents' signals) into a mechanism. This allows the practical use of machine learning algorithms that give good results even when many agents provide noisy information. 3) For finite signal spaces, we obtain $\epsilon$-strongly truthful mechanisms on any stochastically relevant prior, which is the maximal possible prior. In contrast, prior work only achieves a weaker notion of truthfulness (informed truthfulness) or requires stronger assumptions on the prior.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12a192232dfca3d15f6f13c44792b56f9e1c5504,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14730,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12a192232dfca3d15f6f13c44792b56f9e1c5504,Information Technology Convergence and Services,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Mathematics",19,47427945515d72aeb6e10272286c0169,10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2021.78,2009.14730,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Berry",2020,"The proliferation of real-time applications has spurred much interest in data freshness, captured by the age-of-information (AoI) metric. When strategic data sources have private market information, a fundamental economic challenge is how to incentivize them to acquire fresh data and optimize the age-related performance. In this work, we consider an information update system in which a destination acquires, and pays for, fresh data updates from multiple sources. The destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general increasing function of the AoI. Each source is strategic and incurs a sampling cost, which is its private information and may not be truthfully reported to the destination. The destination decides on the price of updates, when to get them, and who should generate them, based on the sources’ reported sampling costs. We show that a benchmark that naively trusts the sources’ reports can lead to an arbitrarily bad outcome compared to the case where sources truthfully report. To tackle this issue, we design an optimal (economic) mechanism for timely information acquisition following Myerson’s seminal work. To this end, our proposed optimal mechanism minimizes the sum of the destination’s age-related cost and its payment to the sources, while ensuring that the sources truthfully report their private information and will voluntarily participate in the mechanism. However, finding the optimal mechanisms may suffer from prohibitively expensive computational overheads as it involves solving a nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimization problem. We further propose a quantized version of the optimal mechanism that achieves asymptotic optimality, maintains the other economic properties, and enables one to tradeoff between optimality and computational overheads. Our analytical and numerical studies show that (i) both the optimal and quantized mechanisms can lead to an unbounded benefit under some distributions of the source costs compared against a benchmark; (ii) the optimal and quantized mechanisms are most beneficial when there are few sources with heterogeneous sampling costs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6755b107bdd6b6ff93f7ad7d0357bdebc5d15fd5,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15751,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6755b107bdd6b6ff93f7ad7d0357bdebc5d15fd5,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",19,31426f65459024e7828f5f70c6f3e759,10.1109/JSAC.2021.3065090,2006.15751,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

We first unpack the historical context of alignment tracing back to the 1920s (where it comes from), then delve into the mathematical essence of alignment (what it is), shedding light on the inherent challenges. Following this foundation, we provide a detailed examination of existing alignment methods, which fall into three categories: RL-based Alignment, SFT-based Alignment, and Inference-Time Alignment, and demonstrate their intrinsic connections, strengths, and limitations, helping readers better understand this research area.

Recent years have witnessed a blossom in applying machine learning (ML) methods to revolutionize the paradigm of turbulence modeling. However, due to the black-box essence of most ML methods, it is currently hard to extract interpretable information and knowledge from data-driven models. To address this critical limitation, this work leverages deep learning with symbolic regression methods to discover hidden governing equations of Reynolds stress models. Specifically, the Reynolds stress tensor is decomposed into linear and non-linear parts. While the linear part is taken as the regular linear eddy viscosity model, a long short-term memory neural network is employed to generate symbolic terms on which tractable mathematical expressions for the non-linear counterpart are built. A novel reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to train the neural network to produce best-fitted symbolic expressions. Within the proposed framework, the Reynolds stress closure is explicitly expressed in algebraic forms, thus allowing for direct functional inference. On the other hand, the Galilean and rotational invariance are craftily respected by constructing the training feature space with independent invariants and tensor basis functions. The performance of the present methodology is validated through numerical simulations of three different canonical flows that deviate in geometrical configurations. The results demonstrate promising accuracy improvements over traditional RANS models, showing the generalization ability of the proposed method. Moreover, with the given explicit model equations, it can be easier to interpret the influence of input features on generated models.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36d8ae4f119bb8564c51a6dc4d1d1338f85def52,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09048,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36d8ae4f119bb8564c51a6dc4d1d1338f85def52,The Physics of Fluids,"Physics, Engineering, Computer Science",19,7fb6f9965173d1a25eb2f39a2b5fb4fc,10.1063/5.0135638,2301.09048,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Zimmermann, Thomas Klein, Wieland Brendel",2023,"In light of the recent widespread adoption of AI systems, understanding the internal information processing of neural networks has become increasingly critical. Most recently, machine vision has seen remarkable progress by scaling neural networks to unprecedented levels in dataset and model size. We here ask whether this extraordinary increase in scale also positively impacts the field of mechanistic interpretability. In other words, has our understanding of the inner workings of scaled neural networks improved as well? We use a psychophysical paradigm to quantify one form of mechanistic interpretability for a diverse suite of nine models and find no scaling effect for interpretability - neither for model nor dataset size. Specifically, none of the investigated state-of-the-art models are easier to interpret than the GoogLeNet model from almost a decade ago. Latest-generation vision models appear even less interpretable than older architectures, hinting at a regression rather than improvement, with modern models sacrificing interpretability for accuracy. These results highlight the need for models explicitly designed to be mechanistically interpretable and the need for more helpful interpretability methods to increase our understanding of networks at an atomic level. We release a dataset containing more than 130'000 human responses from our psychophysical evaluation of 767 units across nine models. This dataset facilitates research on automated instead of human-based interpretability evaluations, which can ultimately be leveraged to directly optimize the mechanistic interpretability of models.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e4ad5efadaaa317d7f8f148e8c7d10fce97ba59,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05471,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e4ad5efadaaa317d7f8f148e8c7d10fce97ba59,Neural Information Processing Systems,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Psychology",19,7e21182671206a85590c03a3e1f9aa5d,10.48550/arXiv.2307.05471,2307.05471,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:20.140217+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:49.606063+00:00

Ba",2021,"The dictionary learning problem, representing data as a combination of a few atoms, has long stood as a popular method for learning representations in statistics and signal processing. The most popular dictionary learning algorithm alternates between sparse coding and dictionary update steps, and a rich literature has studied its theoretical convergence. The success of dictionary learning relies on access to a""good""initial estimate of the dictionary and the ability of the sparse coding step to provide an unbiased estimate of the code. The growing popularity of unrolled sparse coding networks has led to the empirical finding that backpropagation through such networks performs dictionary learning. We offer the theoretical analysis of these empirical results through PUDLE, a Provable Unrolled Dictionary LEarning method. We provide conditions on the network initialization and data distribution sufficient to recover and preserve the support of the latent code. Additionally, we address two challenges; first, the vanilla unrolled sparse coding computes a biased code estimate, and second, gradients during backpropagated learning can become unstable. We show approaches to reduce the bias of the code estimate in the forward pass, and that of the dictionary estimate in the backward pass. We propose strategies to resolve the learning instability by tuning network parameters and modifying the loss function. Overall, we highlight the impact of loss, unrolling, and backpropagation on convergence. We complement our findings through synthetic and image denoising experiments. Finally, we demonstrate PUDLE's interpretability, a driving factor in designing deep networks based on iterative optimizations, by building a mathematical relation between network weights, its output, and the training set.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01a483ff33c1936a72d3ef65dfccba4c2680ef74,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00058.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01a483ff33c1936a72d3ef65dfccba4c2680ef74,Trans.

The most narrow technical definition requires a claim of causality, while a broader technical definition allows for any exploration of a model’s internals. However, the term also has a narrow cultural definition describing a cultural movement. To understand this semantic drift, we present a history of the NLP interpretability community and the formation of the separate, parallel mechanistic interpretability community.

Incentive mechanism is fundamentally important for mobile crowdsensing systems. Many mobile crowdsensing systems expect to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. Most of the existing works transform the multiobjective problem into a single objective problem through constraints or scalarization method. However, due to the uncertain importance (weights) of objectives and the instable quality of crowdsensed data, such transformation is usually unrealizable. In this article, we aim to optimize the worst performance of two objective functions in mobile crowdsensing in order to improve the system robustness. We model an auction-based biobjective robust mobile crowdsensing system, and design two independent objective functions to maximize the expected profit and coverage, respectively. We formulate the robust user selection (RUS) problem, and design an incentive mechanism, which utilizes the combination of binary search and greedy algorithm, to solve the RUS problem. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the designed incentive mechanisms satisfy desirable properties of computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, and constant approximation to the tightened RUS problem. Moreover, the proposed incentive mechanism can be easily extended to multiobjective robust mobile crowdsensing systems, and all desirable properties still hold. The simulation results reveal that our incentive mechanism achieves 11% improvement of the platform’s utility, compared with the greedy algorithm for biobjective mobile crowdsensing systems on average.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb1c19cc8ea722c5b606f726a1c312d7527326ed,https://doi.org/10.1109/jiot.2021.3072953,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb1c19cc8ea722c5b606f726a1c312d7527326ed,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"Computer Science, Computer Science",17,8abd3084d03671c827e92ecb23b23f91,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3072953,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Penta",2020,"This work concerns the study of the effective balance equations governing linear elastic electrostrictive composites, where mechanical strains can be observed due to the application of a given electric field in the so-called small strain and moderate electric field regime. The formulation is developed in the framework of the active elastic composites. The latter are defined as composite materials constitutively described by an additive decomposition of the stress tensor into a purely linear elastic contribution and another component, which is assumed to be given and quadratic in the applied electric field when further specialised to electrostrictive composites. We derive the new mathematical model by describing the effective mechanical behaviour of the whole material by means of the asymptotic (periodic) homogenisation technique. We assume that there exists a sharp separation between the micro-scale, where the distance among different sub-phases (i.e. inclusions and/or fibres and/or strata) is resolved, and the macro-scale, which is related to the average size of the whole system at hand. This way, we formally decompose spatial variations by assuming that every physical field and material property are depending on both the macro-scale and the micro-scale. The effective governing equations encode the role of the micro-structure, and the effective contributions to the global stress tensor are to be computed by solving appropriate linear-elastic-type cell problems on the periodic cell. We also provide analytic formulae for the electrostrictive tensor when the applied electric field is either microscopically uniform or given by a suitable multiplicative decomposition between purely microscopically and macroscopically varying components. The obtained results are consistently compared with previous works in the field, and can pave the way towards improvement of smart active materials currently utilised for engineering (possibly bio-inspired) purposes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4cb9076c29bffbab4c17f45494cdcf31fa4847b,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00033-020-01365-x.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4cb9076c29bffbab4c17f45494cdcf31fa4847b,Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Physik,"Physics, Materials Science, Engineering, Physics",17,7cc6bc1c61e2eaebada957a978e5a88f,10.1007/s00033-020-01365-x,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Materials Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

These descriptions are derived using inputs that activate the feature, which may be a dimension or a direction in the model's representation space. However, identifying activating inputs is costly, and the mechanistic role of a feature in model behavior is determined both by how inputs cause a feature to activate and by how feature activation affects outputs. Using steering evaluations, we reveal that current pipelines provide descriptions that fail to capture the causal effect of the feature on outputs. To fix this, we propose efficient, output-centric methods for automatically generating feature descriptions.

With aggregation algorithms advancing, a potential economic scenario arises where fine-tuning services are provided to agents with different preferences. In this context, agents may benefit from strategically misreporting their preferences, which could affect the fine-tuned outcomes. This paper addresses such incentive issues by framing it as a mechanism design problem: an LLM provider determines the fine-tuning objective (training rule) and the pricing scheme (payment rule) for agents. We primarily focus on a representative class of training rules that maximize social welfare subject to certain regularizations, referred to as \tr\ rules. Firstly, we show that under most circumstances, truthful reporting is sub-optimal with simply a training rule, thereby highlighting the necessity of payments. Secondly, we design affine maximizer payment rules that implement \tr\ rules in dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). We characterize sufficient conditions for payment equivalence properties. For a training rule that satisfies these conditions, we have found all the payment rules that implement it in DSIC, as they only differ by a constant term irrelevant to agents' reports from each other. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our mechanism is approximately DSIC even with perturbed input, showcasing its robustness against the inevitable errors in real-world applications. Experiments on real LLM setups further confirm the practical implications of our results.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b36760782b4cfd9359c6d4a57c86e2630393b1a3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16276.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b36760782b4cfd9359c6d4a57c86e2630393b1a3,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",16,cf90bff53b876d33526187aa53b35d74,10.48550/arXiv.2405.16276,2405.16276,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

However, more complex NLP models are more difficult to interpret and computationally expensive. Therefore, we propose an approach to dictionary creation that carefully balances the trade-off between complexity and interpretability. This approach combines a deep neural network architecture with techniques to improve model explainability to automatically build a domain-specific dictionary. As an illustrative use case of our approach, we create an objective dictionary that can infer conflict intensity from text data. We train the neural networks on a corpus of conflict reports and match them with conflict event data. This corpus consists of over 14,000 expert-written International Crisis Group (ICG) CrisisWatch reports between 2003 and 2021. Sensitivity analysis is used to extract the weighted words from the neural network to build the dictionary. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare our results to state-of-the-art deep learning language models, text-scaling methods, as well as standard, nonspecialized, and conflict event dictionary approaches.

Both the principal and the agent can have arbitrary and potentially different valuations for the actions taken, possibly also depending on the actual state of the world. Moreover, at any time, the state of the world may evolve arbitrarily depending on the action taken by the principal. The goal is to compute an optimal mechanism which maximizes the principal's utility in the face of the self-interested strategic agent. We give an efficient algorithm for computing optimal mechanisms, with or without payments, under different individual-rationality constraints, when the time horizon is constant. Our algorithm is based on a sophisticated linear program formulation, which can be customized in various ways to accommodate richer constraints. For environments with large time horizons, we show that the principal's optimal utility is hard to approximate within a certain constant factor, complementing our algorithmic result. We further consider a special case of the problem where the agent is myopic, and give a refined efficient algorithm whose time complexity scales linearly in the time horizon. Moreover, we show that memoryless mechanisms do not provide a good solution for our problem, in terms of both optimality and computational tractability. These results paint a relatively complete picture for automated dynamic mechanism design in unstructured environments. Finally, we present experimental results where our algorithms are applied to synthetic dynamic environments with different characteristics, which not only serve as a proof of concept for our algorithms, but also exhibit intriguing phenomena in dynamic mechanism design.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1280cc7857265bbda8278b70598ca293bced0747,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06008.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1280cc7857265bbda8278b70598ca293bced0747,Neural Information Processing Systems,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",15,94b72ae0346171d2c8f5b9f7eabfef47,,2105.06008,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

We validated PDR on simulated data and identified limitations of existing methods in recovering the true components. We applied PDR to three clusters of 5-6 traits genetically correlated with coronary disease, asthma, and type II diabetes respectively, producing biologically interpretable components. For CAD, PDR identified components related to BMI, hypertension and cholesterol, and it clarified the relationship among these highly correlated risk factors. We assigned variants to components, calculated their posterior-mean effect sizes, and performed out-of-sample validation. Our posterior-mean effect sizes pool statistical power across traits and substantially boost the correlation (r2) between true and estimated effect sizes compared with the original summary statistics: by 94% and 70% for asthma and T2D out of sample, and by a predicted 300% for CAD.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/699cf0ab3bb84b5314743c7b9cdd24c4c04942a4,http://www.cell.com/article/S0002929722001513/pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/699cf0ab3bb84b5314743c7b9cdd24c4c04942a4,bioRxiv,"Biology, Medicine, Biology, Medicine",15,d25eec524a65bea9fb8e2188591bc1e8,10.1101/2021.11.25.470021,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Plaza",2023,"Subspace learning has been widely applied for feature extraction of hyperspectral images (HSIs) and achieved great success. However, the current methods still leave two problems that need to be further investigated. First, those methods mainly focus on finding one or multiple projection matrices for mapping the high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional subspace, which can only capture the information from each direction of high-order hyperspectral data separately. Second, the performance of feature extraction is barely satisfactory when the hyperspectral data is severely corrupted by noise. To address these issues, this article presents a t-linear tensor subspace learning (tLTSL) model for robust feature extraction of HSIs based on t-product projection. In the model, t-product projection is a new defined tensor transformation way similar to linear transformation in vector space, which can maximally capture the intrinsic structure of tensor data. The integrated tensor low-rank and sparse decomposition can effectively remove the noise corruption and the learned t-product projection can directly transform the high-order hyperspectral data into a subspace with information from all modes comprehensively considered. Moreover, a proposition related to tensor rank is proofed for interpreting the meaning of the tLTSL model. Extensive experiments are conducted on two different kinds of noise (i.e., simulated and real noise) corrupted HSI data, which validate the effectiveness of tLTSL.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b12e1a3c60caa30e9aaa5cd211df60ad8e56229f,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b12e1a3c60caa30e9aaa5cd211df60ad8e56229f,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"Computer Science, Environmental Science, Computer Science, Engineering",15,3cd751ee49ce60fc4a54dbc1ab4d5560,10.1109/TGRS.2023.3233945,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Waelkens, B. De Moor",2021,"Rationale Non‐negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been used extensively for the analysis of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data, visualizing simultaneously the spatial and spectral distributions present in a slice of tissue. The statistical framework offers two related NMF methods: probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is a generative model. This work offers a mathematical comparison between NMF, PLSA, and LDA, and includes a detailed evaluation of Kullback–Leibler NMF (KL‐NMF) for MSI for the first time. We will inspect the results for MSI data analysis as these different mathematical approaches impose different characteristics on the data and the resulting decomposition. Methods The four methods (NMF, KL‐NMF, PLSA, and LDA) are compared on seven different samples: three originated from mice pancreas and four from human‐lymph‐node tissues, all obtained using matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF MS). Results Where matrix factorization methods are often used for the analysis of MSI data, we find that each method has different implications on the exactness and interpretability of the results. We have discovered promising results using KL‐NMF, which has only rarely been used for MSI so far, improving both NMF and PLSA, and have shown that the hitherto stated equivalent KL‐NMF and PLSA algorithms do differ in the case of MSI data analysis. LDA, assumed to be the better method in the field of text mining, is shown to be outperformed by PLSA in the setting of MALDI‐MSI. Additionally, the molecular results of the human‐lymph‐node data have been thoroughly analyzed for better assessment of the methods under investigation. Conclusions We present an in‐depth comparison of multiple NMF‐related factorization methods for MSI. We aim to provide fellow researchers in the field of MSI a clear understanding of the mathematical implications using each of these analytical techniques, which might affect the exactness and interpretation of the results.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f0ab1f2599758ccdd4d6d934744f64573a6d4ff,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/rcm.9181,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f0ab1f2599758ccdd4d6d934744f64573a6d4ff,Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry,"Medicine, Mathematics, Medicine, Chemistry",15,e3e569a7a9d9390a193527393f0689df,10.1002/rcm.9181,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Chemistry'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

Linssen, A. Morrison, Gaute T. Einevoll",2022,"Simulations of neural activity at different levels of detail are ubiquitous in modern neurosciences, aiding the interpretation of experimental data and underlying neural mechanisms at the level of cells and circuits. Extracellular measurements of brain signals reflecting transmembrane currents throughout the neural tissue remain commonplace. The lower frequencies (≲ 300Hz) of measured signals generally stem from synaptic activity driven by recurrent interactions among neural populations and computational models should also incorporate accurate predictions of such signals. Due to limited computational resources, large-scale neuronal network models (≳ 106 neurons or so) often require reducing the level of biophysical detail and account mainly for times of action potentials (‘spikes’) or spike rates. Corresponding extracellular signal predictions have thus poorly accounted for their biophysical origin. Here we propose a computational framework for predicting spatiotemporal filter kernels for such extracellular signals stemming from synaptic activity, accounting for the biophysics of neurons, populations, and recurrent connections. Signals are obtained by convolving population spike rates by appropriate kernels for each connection pathway and summing the contributions. Our main results are that kernels derived via linearized synapse and membrane dynamics, distributions of cells, conduction delay, and volume conductor model allow for accurately capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of ground truth extracellular signals from conductance-based multicompartment neuron networks. One particular observation is that changes in the effective membrane time constants caused by persistent synapse activation must be accounted for. The work also constitutes a major advance in computational efficacy of accurate, biophysics-based signal predictions from large-scale spike and rate-based neuron network models drastically reducing signal prediction times compared to biophysically detailed network models. This work also provides insight into how experimentally recorded low-frequency extracellular signals of neuronal activity may be approximately linearly dependent on spiking activity. A new software tool LFPykernels serves as a reference implementation of the framework. Author summary Understanding the brain’s function and activity in healthy and pathological states across spatial scales and times spanning entire lives is one of humanity’s great undertakings. In experimental and clinical work probing the brain’s activity, a variety of electric and magnetic measurement techniques are routinely applied. However interpreting the extracellularly measured signals remains arduous due to multiple factors, mainly the large number of neurons contributing to the signals and complex interactions occurring in recurrently connected neuronal circuits. To understand how neurons give rise to such signals, mechanistic modeling combined with forward models derived using volume conductor theory has proven to be successful, but this approach currently does not scale to the systems level (encompassing millions of neurons or more) where simplified or abstract neuron representations typically are used. Motivated by experimental findings implying approximately linear relationships between times of neuronal action potentials and extracellular population signals, we provide a biophysics-based method for computing causal filters relating spikes and extracellular signals that can be applied with spike times or rates of large-scale neuronal network models for predictions of population signals without relying on ad hoc approximations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/249f545b4673d03f04bfd526e8dde5b8413a989d,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010353&type=printable,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/249f545b4673d03f04bfd526e8dde5b8413a989d,bioRxiv,"Computer Science, Medicine, Biology, Computer Science",15,b4756fc132a390d62445e6b4b27701a9,10.1101/2022.02.28.482256,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Compute - the computational power and infrastructure required to train and run these AI models - is emerging as a node for oversight. KYC, a standard developed by the banking sector to identify and verify client identity, could provide a mechanism for greater public oversight of frontier AI development and close loopholes in existing export controls. Such a scheme has the potential to identify and warn stakeholders of potentially problematic and/or sudden advancements in AI capabilities, build government capacity for AI regulation, and allow for the development and implementation of more nuanced and targeted export controls. Unlike the strategy of limiting access to AI chip purchases, regulating the digital access to compute offers more precise controls, allowing regulatory control over compute quantities, as well as the flexibility to suspend access at any time. To enact a KYC scheme, the US government will need to work closely with industry to (1) establish a dynamic threshold of compute that effectively captures high-risk frontier model development, while minimizing imposition on developers not engaged in frontier AI; (2) set requirements and guidance for compute providers to keep records and report high-risk entities; (3) establish government capacity that allows for co-design, implementation, administration and enforcement of the scheme; and (4) engage internationally to promote international alignment with the scheme and support its long-term efficacy. While the scheme will not address all AI risks, it complements proposed solutions by allowing for a more precise and flexible approach to controlling the development of frontier AI models and unwanted AI proliferation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18565476a435fc6ef699c437e01dc29f1ee991b2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13625.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18565476a435fc6ef699c437e01dc29f1ee991b2,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Political Science",14,af59298ad7d9cfc2ce8d64b19a7eac5f,10.48550/arXiv.2310.13625,2310.13625,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Political Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Vucetic, Yonghui Li",2022,"Double auctions play a pivotal role in stimulating active participation of a large number of users comprising both task requesters and workers in mobile crowdsourcing. However, most existing studies have concentrated on designing offline two-sided auction mechanisms and supporting single-type tasks and fixed auction service models. Such works ignore the need of dynamic services and are unsuitable for large-scale crowdsourcing markets with extremely diverse demands (i.e., types and urgency degrees of tasks required by different requesters) and supplies (i.e., task skills and online durations of different workers). In this article, we consider a practical crowdsourcing application with an on-demand service strategy. Especially, we innovatively design three online service models, namely, online single-bid single-task (OSS), online single-bid multiple-task (OSM), and online multiple-bid multiple-task (OMM) models to accommodate diversified tasks and bidding demands for different users. Furthermore, to effectively allocate tasks and facilitate bidding, we propose a truthful online double auction mechanism for each service model based on the McAfee double auction. By doing so, each user can flexibly select auction service models and corresponding auction mechanisms according to their current interested tasks and online duration. To illustrate this, we present a three-demand example to explain the effectiveness of our on-demand service strategy in realistic crowdsourcing applications. Moreover, we theoretically prove that our mechanisms satisfy truthfulness, individual rationality, budget balance, and consumer sovereignty. Through extensive simulations, we show that our mechanisms can accommodate the various demands of different users and improve social utility, including platform utility and average user utility.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94e7dc8528e3222bc5d777c9ce5d48e2e9c0e062,https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/167412/1/FINAL_VERSION_2_.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94e7dc8528e3222bc5d777c9ce5d48e2e9c0e062,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",14,cbe6986ec2a043dc9c4173dca40676ce,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3151924,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Xiong, Shaobo Zhang, Tian Wang",2024,"Emerging crowdsensing paradigm enables a large number of sensing applications, where much attention is drawn to the fundamental problems for maximizing the system utility and improving the data quality. However, the existing works only consider one of the above issues. In fact, the truthful value of data lies in its veracity. The false data submitted by malicious workers brings no benefits and even causes losses to the system. Therefore, the utility calculations without considering the veracity of data in the previous incentive mechanisms are inaccurate. While current truth discovery (TD) methods cost a lot and cannot improve the quality of data at source. To overcome these problems, we design a truthful value discovery and reverse auction (TVD-RA) framework. First, a TD and trust inspection approach are proposed to find the truth and get the trust degree of workers. This combination can capture the truthful value of data and identify malicious workers. In addition, an incentive mechanism based on reverse auction is proposed. Discovered malicious workers are excluded when selecting task performers, thereby improving the quality of data. In addition, tasks are redundantly assigned in the initial period, creating opportunities for trust inspections. Although this entails losses, the influence of malicious workers can be ruled out. Therefore, we gain long-term utility at the expense of current benefits. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed incentive mechanism is incentive compatible and individual rational. We finally carry out extensive evaluations, where results demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism over the state-of-the-art approaches.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7abb1ef04a54374da9608a5bc53722cf189af6fe,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7abb1ef04a54374da9608a5bc53722cf189af6fe,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"Computer Science, Computer Science",14,4c602689dc51831c287aaf26ab8bfe26,10.1109/JIOT.2023.3308072,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

A commonly used method is to divide the matrix into multiple non-intersecting blocks and concurrently calculate them. This operation causes the Load balance problem, which significantly impacts parallel performance and is a big concern. A general belief is that the load balance across blocks is impossible by balancing rows and columns separately. We challenge the belief by proposing an approach of “Balanced Partitioning (BaPa)”. We demonstrate under what circumstance independently balancing rows and columns can lead to the balanced intersection of rows and columns, why, and how. We formally prove the feasibility of BaPa by observing the variance of rating numbers across blocks, and empirically validate its soundness by applying it to two standard parallel matrix factorization algorithms, DSGD and CCD++. Besides, we establish a mathematical model of “Imbalance Degree” to explain further why BaPa works well.

Deleuze, Edith Le Floch",2021,"Abstract Motivation It is more and more common to perform multi-omics analyses to explore the genome at diverse levels and not only at a single level. Through integrative statistical methods, multi-omics data have the power to reveal new biological processes, potential biomarkers and subgroups in a cohort. Matrix factorization (MF) is an unsupervised statistical method that allows a clustering of individuals, but also reveals relevant omics variables from the various blocks. Results Here, we present PIntMF (Penalized Integrative Matrix Factorization), an MF model with sparsity, positivity and equality constraints. To induce sparsity in the model, we used a classical Lasso penalization on variable and individual matrices. For the matrix of samples, sparsity helps in the clustering, while normalization (matching an equality constraint) of inferred coefficients is added to improve interpretation. Moreover, we added an automatic tuning of the sparsity parameters using the famous glmnet package. We also proposed three criteria to help the user to choose the number of latent variables. PIntMF was compared with other state-of-the-art integrative methods including feature selection techniques in both synthetic and real data. PIntMF succeeds in finding relevant clusters as well as variables in two types of simulated data (correlated and uncorrelated). Next, PIntMF was applied to two real datasets (Diet and cancer), and it revealed interpretable clusters linked to available clinical data. Our method outperforms the existing ones on two criteria (clustering and variable selection). We show that PIntMF is an easy, fast and powerful tool to extract patterns and cluster samples from multi-omics data.

CSC brings a natural remedy to the limitation of typical sparse enforcing approaches of handling global and high-dimensional signals by local, patch-based, processing. While the classic field of sparse representations has been able to cater for the diverse challenges of different signal processing tasks by considering a wide range of problem formulations, almost all available algorithms that deploy the CSC model consider the same $\ell _1 - \ell _2$ problem form.

We find a stark difference in unlearning and edit robustness when training components localized by different methods. We highlight an important distinction between methods that localize components based primarily on preserving outputs, and those finding high level mechanisms with predictable intermediate states. In particular, localizing edits/unlearning to components associated with the lookup-table mechanism for factual recall 1) leads to more robust edits/unlearning across different input/output formats, and 2) resists attempts to relearn the unwanted information, while also reducing unintended side effects compared to baselines, on both a sports facts dataset and the CounterFact dataset across multiple models.

Several recent works showed that the transaction fee mechanism design fundamentally departs from classical mechanism design. They then systematically explored the mathematical landscape of this new decentralized mechanism design problem in two settings: in the plain setting where no cryptography is employed, and in a cryptography-assisted setting where the rules of the mechanism are enforced by a multi-party computation protocol. Unfortunately, in both settings, prior works showed that if we want the mechanism to incentivize honest behavior for both users as well as miners (possibly colluding with users), then the miner revenue has to be zero. Although adopting a relaxed, approximate notion of incentive compatibility gets around this zero miner-revenue limitation, the scaling of the miner revenue is nonetheless poor. In this paper, we show that if we make a mildly stronger reasonable-world assumption than prior works, we can circumvent the known limitations on miner revenue, and design auctions that generate optimal miner revenue.

Kleinberg, Rad Niazadeh",2021,"We provide a polynomial time reduction from Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism design to Bayesian algorithm design for welfare maximization problems. Unlike prior results, our reduction achieves exact incentive compatibility for problems with multi-dimensional and continuous type spaces. The key technical barrier preventing exact incentive compatibility in prior black-box reductions is that repairing violations of incentive constraints requires understanding the distribution of the mechanism’s output, which is typically #P-hard to compute. Reductions that instead estimate the output distribution by sampling inevitably suffer from sampling error, which typically precludes exact incentive compatibility. We overcome this barrier by employing and generalizing the computational model in the literature on Bernoulli Factories. In a Bernoulli factory problem, one is given a function mapping the bias of an “input coin” to that of an “output coin,” and the challenge is to efficiently simulate the output coin given only sample access to the input coin.

Superalignment focuses on ensuring that high-level AI systems remain consistent with human values and intentions when dealing with complex, high-risk tasks. The W2SG framework has opened new possibilities for empirical research in this evolving field. Our study simulates two phases of superalignment under the W2SG framework: the development of general superhuman models and the progression towards superintelligence. In the first phase, based on human supervision, the quality of weak supervision is enhanced through a combination of scalable oversight and ensemble learning, reducing the capability gap between weak teachers and strong students. In the second phase, an automatic alignment evaluator is employed as the weak supervisor. By recursively updating this auto aligner, the capabilities of the weak teacher models are synchronously enhanced, achieving weak-to-strong supervision over stronger student models.We also provide an initial validation of the proposed approach for the first phase. Using the SciQ task as example, we explore ensemble learning for weak teacher models through bagging and boosting. Scalable oversight is explored through two auxiliary settings: human-AI interaction and AI-AI debate. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of improved weak supervision on enhancing weak-to-strong generalization based on in-context learning.

G. Gordon, Richard K. Perez, Evan Biederstedt, R. Bueno, Chun Jimmie Ye, P. Kharchenko",2022,"Tissue- and organism-level biological processes often involve coordinated action of multiple distinct cell types. Current computational methods for the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, however, are not designed to capture co-variation of cell states across samples, in part due to the low number of biological samples in most scRNA-seq datasets. Recent advances in sample multiplexing have enabled population-scale scRNA-seq measurements of tens to hundreds of samples. To take advantage of such datasets, here we introduce a computational approach called single-cell Interpretable Tensor Decomposition (scITD). This method extracts “multicellular gene expression patterns” that capture how sample-specific expression states of a cell type are correlated with the expression states of other cell types. Such multicellular patterns can reveal molecular mechanisms underlying coordinated changes of different cell types within the tissue, and can be used to stratify individuals in a clinically-relevant and reproducible manner. We first validated the performance of scITD using in vitro experimental data and simulations. We then applied scITD to scRNA-seq data on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 115 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 56 healthy controls. We recapitulated a well-established pan-cell-type signature of interferon-signaling that was associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies and a disease activity index. We further identified a novel multicellular pattern linked to nephritis, which was characterized by an expansion of activated memory B cells along with helper T cell activation. Our approach also sheds light on ligand-receptor interactions potentially mediating these multicellular patterns. As validation, we demonstrated that these expression patterns also stratified donors from a pediatric SLE dataset by the same phenotypic attributes. Lastly, we found the interferon multicellular pattern and others to be conserved in a COVID-19 dataset, pointing to the presence of both general and disease-specific patterns of inter-individual immune variation. Overall, scITD is a flexible method for exploring co-variation of cell states in multi-sample single-cell datasets, which can yield new insights into complex non-cell-autonomous dependencies that define and stratify disease.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/873a9af69644168c1c7565d262f523cb7ccfba72,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/873a9af69644168c1c7565d262f523cb7ccfba72,bioRxiv,"Biology, Medicine, Biology, Computer Science",13,19a617b041bda01df414b0c5b87bf1dd,10.1101/2022.02.16.480703,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Yet, their inherent lack of interpretability remains a significant challenge, as these features are often opaque to human understanding. In this paper, we propose Non-negative Contrastive Learning (NCL), a renaissance of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aimed at deriving interpretable features. The power of NCL lies in its enforcement of non-negativity constraints on features, reminiscent of NMF's capability to extract features that align closely with sample clusters. NCL not only aligns mathematically well with an NMF objective but also preserves NMF's interpretability attributes, resulting in a more sparse and disentangled representation compared to standard contrastive learning (CL). Theoretically, we establish guarantees on the identifiability and downstream generalization of NCL. Empirically, we show that these advantages enable NCL to outperform CL significantly on feature disentanglement, feature selection, as well as downstream classification tasks. At last, we show that NCL can be easily extended to other learning scenarios and benefit supervised learning as well.

Traditional noise attenuation methods are often ineffective for intricate aperiodic noise. To address the abovementioned problem, we have developed a novel noise isolation method based on the fast Fourier transform, complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), and shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC, an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm under a data-driven framework). First, large powerline noise is accurately subtracted in the frequency domain. Then, the CEEMD-based algorithm is used to correct the large baseline drift. Finally, taking advantage of the sparsity of periodic signals, SISC is applied to autonomously learn a feature atom (the useful signal with a length of one period) from the detrended signal and recover the CSEM signal with high accuracy. We determine the performance of the SISC by comparing it with three other promising signal processing methods, such as the mathematic morphology filtering, soft-threshold wavelet filtering, and K-singular-value decomposition (another dictionary learning method) sparse decomposition. Experimental results illustrate that SISC provides the best performance. Robustness test results indicate that SISC can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of noisy signal from 0 to more than 15 dB. Case studies of synthetic and real data collected in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan indicate that our method is capable of effectively recovering the useful signal from the observed data contaminated with different kinds of strong ambient noise.

Given embedding vector $\boldsymbol{h}_{c,t} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ at sequence position $t \le T$ in a sequence (or context) $c \le C$, extracting the mean effects yields the decomposition \[ \boldsymbol{h}_{c,t} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \mathbf{pos}_t + \mathbf{ctx}_c + \mathbf{resid}_{c,t} \] where $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the global mean vector, $\mathbf{pos}_t$ and $\mathbf{ctx}_c$ are the mean vectors across contexts and across positions respectively, and $\mathbf{resid}_{c,t}$ is the residual vector. For popular transformer architectures and diverse text datasets, empirically we find pervasive mathematical structure: (1) $(\mathbf{pos}_t)_{t}$ forms a low-dimensional, continuous, and often spiral shape across layers, (2) $(\mathbf{ctx}_c)_c$ shows clear cluster structure that falls into context topics, and (3) $(\mathbf{pos}_t)_{t}$ and $(\mathbf{ctx}_c)_c$ are mutually nearly orthogonal.

To address these problems, we propose a novel blind quality assessment method based on macro-micro modeling of tensor domain dictionary for SCIs in this article. In the proposed method, the tensor decomposition is explored first to avoid the loss of color information, and then a target dictionary is learned more effectively with the principal components. Furthermore, a macro-micro model is established to characterize the micro and macro features in the target dictionary space, which can provide a systematic mathematical interpretation for feature extraction. For the micro features, a log-normal pooling scheme is designed to enhance the effectiveness of feature aggregation by analyzing the particularity of the statistical distribution of sparse codes. Additionally, the statistical properties are mainly discussed and studied based on the Bernoulli law of large numbers, and then a reliable macro feature is generated to describe the relationship between the statistical distribution and quality degradation of SCIs.

We identify a number of desired properties of ProtoFac including authenticity, interpretability, simplicity and propose the optimization objective and training procedure accordingly. The method is model-agnostic and can be applied to DNNs with varying architectures. It goes beyond per-sample feature-based explanation by providing prototypes as a condensed set of evidences used by the model for decision making. We applied ProtoFac to interpret pretrained DNNs for a variety of ML tasks including time series classification on electrocardiograms, and image classification. The result shows that ProtoFac is able to extract meaningful prototypes to explain the models' decisions while truthfully reflects the models' operation. We also evaluated human interpretability through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), showing that ProtoFac is able to produce interpretable and user-friendly explanations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e34cad30e913b073aeb054b6eaf2174815e0b6f,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e34cad30e913b073aeb054b6eaf2174815e0b6f,2020 International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW),"Computer Science, Computer Science",12,5bbcd1ccd2bd27b63b6681e74caec371,10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00068,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

Nawrot",2021,"Animal nervous systems are highly efficient in processing sensory input. The neuromorphic computing paradigm aims at the hardware implementation of neural network computations to support novel solutions for building brain-inspired computing systems. Here, we take inspiration from sensory processing in the nervous system of the fruit fly larva. With its strongly limited computational resources of <200 neurons and <1.000 synapses the larval olfactory pathway employs fundamental computations to transform broadly tuned receptor input at the periphery into an energy efficient sparse code in the central brain. We show how this approach allows us to achieve sparse coding and increased separability of stimulus patterns in a spiking neural network, validated with both software simulation and hardware emulation on mixed-signal real-time neuromorphic hardware. We verify that feedback inhibition is the central motif to support sparseness in the spatial domain, across the neuron population, while the combination of spike frequency adaptation and feedback inhibition determines sparseness in the temporal domain. Our experiments demonstrate that such small, biologically realistic neural networks, efficiently implemented on neuromorphic hardware, can achieve parallel processing and efficient encoding of sensory input at full temporal resolution.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5949021c7a055183b2403cc36c90841e9091a70a,https://doi.org/10.1088/2634-4386/ac3ba6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5949021c7a055183b2403cc36c90841e9091a70a,bioRxiv,"Computer Science, Biology, Physics, Biology, Computer Science",12,d2d689d71ccb8600e06223f745050cbf,10.1088/2634-4386/ac3ba6,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:59.362493+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:59.362493+00:00

Generative modeling-based connectome analysis, in particular, plays a vital role in deciphering the neural mechanisms of cognitive functions in health and dysfunction in diseases. Here we review the foundation and development of major generative modeling approaches for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and survey their applications to cognitive or clinical neuroscience problems. We argue that conventional structural and functional connectivity (FC) analysis alone is not sufficient to reveal the complex circuit interactions underlying observed neuroimaging data and should be supplemented with generative modeling-based effective connectivity and simulation, a fruitful practice that we term “mechanistic connectome.” The transformation from descriptive connectome to mechanistic connectome will open up promising avenues to gain mechanistic insights into the delicate operating principles of the human brain and their potential impairments in diseases, which facilitates the development of effective personalized treatments to curb neurological and psychiatric disorders.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/945d41d3527e1efb001cb526e6f5798d9e9eac37,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.940842/pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/945d41d3527e1efb001cb526e6f5798d9e9eac37,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Medicine, Medicine",12,6adbd32838ee4ab991d9c67cdd0fd240,10.3389/fnhum.2022.940842,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Daunizeau",2020,"Drift-diffusion models or DDMs are becoming a standard in the field of computational neuroscience. They extend models from signal detection theory by proposing a simple mechanistic explanation for the observed relationship between decision outcomes and reaction times (RT). In brief, they assume that decisions are triggered once the accumulated evidence in favor of a particular alternative option has reached a predefined threshold. Fitting a DDM to empirical data then allows one to interpret observed group or condition differences in terms of a change in the underlying model parameters. However, current approaches only yield reliable parameter estimates in specific situations (c.f. fixed drift rates vs drift rates varying over trials). In addition, they become computationally unfeasible when more general DDM variants are considered (e.g., with collapsing bounds). In this note, we propose a fast and efficient approach to parameter estimation that relies on fitting a “self-consistency” equation that RT fulfill under the DDM. This effectively bypasses the computational bottleneck of standard DDM parameter estimation approaches, at the cost of estimating the trial-specific neural noise variables that perturb the underlying evidence accumulation process. For the purpose of behavioral data analysis, these act as nuisance variables and render the model “overcomplete”, which is finessed using a variational Bayesian system identification scheme. But for the purpose of neural data analysis, estimates of neural noise perturbation terms are a desirable (and unique) feature of the approach. Using numerical simulations, we show that this “overcomplete” approach matches the performance of current parameter estimation approaches for simple DDM variants, and outperforms them for more complex DDM variants. Finally, we demonstrate the added-value of the approach, when applied to a recent value-based decision making experiment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/274afb719b214c1f842df6582ce4aa0c22d2a7c6,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.531316/pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/274afb719b214c1f842df6582ce4aa0c22d2a7c6,bioRxiv,"Computer Science, Biology, Medicine, Computer Science, Psychology",12,35a43da4920d46292cb1a84c4ebd042a,10.3389/frai.2021.531316,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

With the development of large language models (LLMs), some researchers treat large language models as intelligent agents to stimulate and evaluate their planning capabilities. However, the planning mechanism is still unclear. In this work, we focus on exploring the look-ahead planning mechanism in large language models from the perspectives of information flow and internal representations. First, we study how planning is done internally by analyzing the multi-layer perception (MLP) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) components at the last token. We find that the output of MHSA in the middle layers at the last token can directly decode the decision to some extent. Based on this discovery, we further trace the source of MHSA by information flow, and we reveal that MHSA extracts information from spans of the goal states and recent steps. According to information flow, we continue to study what information is encoded within it. Specifically, we explore whether future decisions have been considered in advance in the representation of flow. We demonstrate that the middle and upper layers encode a few short-term future decisions. Overall, our research analyzes the look-ahead planning mechanisms of LLMs, facilitating future research on LLMs performing planning tasks.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfbdf67fc11977637d4cb13ed7e1abce75623796,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16033.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfbdf67fc11977637d4cb13ed7e1abce75623796,Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,"Computer Science, Computer Science",12,6e696248b5b3aa29ab2f143534430cca,10.48550/arXiv.2406.16033,2406.16033,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:17.225844+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:46.265987+00:00

Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) intends to reverse-engineer neural network behaviors in terms of human-understandable components.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tries to mechanistically understand a behavior involving the prediction of multiple consecutive tokens. We discover that the prediction is performed by a circuit composed of 8 attention heads (~5% of the total heads) which we classified in three groups according to their role. We also demonstrate that these heads concentrate the acronym prediction functionality. In addition, we mechanistically interpret the most relevant heads of the circuit and find out that they use positional information which is propagated via the causal mask mechanism.

We prove hardness results when the revelation principle does not necessarily hold, as well as when types have even minimally different preferences. In light of these hardness results, we focus on truthful mechanisms in the setting where all types share the same preference over outcomes, which is motivated by applications in, e.g., strategic classification. We present a number of algorithmic and structural results, including an efficient algorithm for finding optimal deterministic truthful mechanisms, which also implies a faster algorithm for finding optimal randomized truthful mechanisms via a characterization based on the notion of convexity. We then consider a more general setting, where the principal's cost is a function of the combination of outcomes assigned to each type. In particular, we focus on the case where the cost function is submodular, and give generalizations of essentially all our results in the classical setting where the cost function is additive.

Mobile users with different wireless channel conditions can obtain different numbers of layers and have different quality of experience (QoE). To enhance the QoE of the users that suffer from the worse channel quality, it is beneficial to stimulate users’ cooperation in relaying enhancement layers. However, potential relays may be unwilling to truthfully cooperate with receivers, which results in the asymmetric information problem in relay selecting. In this paper, we model the video relaying selection as a market with multiple receivers (principals) and relays (agents), and solve the problem according to the contract theory. The proposed solution is divided into following two steps: first, contract design and item preselection, and second, matching between each principal and agent. We propose a contract parameter determination method termed as the Matching-Aware strategy. Different from traditional strategies, the proposed Matching-Aware strategy makes the contract competitive in principal-agent matching without knowing the probability distribution of relays’ types. The matching step is undertaken by the base station with the purpose of maximizing the social welfare. Numerical results corroborate that the contract-based video relaying scheme can tackle the asymmetric information problem. Besides, compared with other two baseline strategies, the proposed Matching-Aware strategy achieves higher QoE.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a980c758169552f9334d67f59563cb55a4229468,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a980c758169552f9334d67f59563cb55a4229468,IEEE transactions on multimedia,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",11,5c3715a934908ee0ad78132eb9ee1bc6,10.1109/TMM.2019.2929965,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Most interpretability literature focuses on providing semantic meaning to convolutional filters to explain a model's reasoning process and confirm its use of relevant information from the input domain. Fully connected layers can be studied by decomposing their weight matrices using a singular value decomposition, in effect studying the correlations between the rows in each matrix to discover the dynamics of the map. In this work we define a singular value decomposition for the weight tensor of a convolutional layer, which provides an analogous understanding of the correlations between filters, exposing the dynamics of the convolutional map. We validate our definition using recent results in random matrix theory. By applying the decomposition across the linear layers of an image classification network we suggest a framework against which interpretability methods might be applied using hypergraphs to model class separation. Rather than looking to the activations to explain the network, we use the singular vectors with the greatest corresponding singular values for each linear layer to identify those features most important to the network.

Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely applied to multi-view clustering owing to its interpretability. However, most NMF-based algorithms only factorize multi-view data based on the shallow structure, neglecting complex hierarchical and heterogeneous information in multi-view data. In this paper, we propose a deep multiple non-negative matrix factorization (DMNMF) framework based on AutoEncoder for multi-view clustering. DMNMF consists of multiple Encoder Components and Decoder Components with deep structures. Each pair of Encoder Component and Decoder Component are used to hierarchically factorize the input data from a view for capturing the hierarchical information, and all Encoder and Decoder Components are integrated into an abstract level to learn a common low-dimensional representation for combining the heterogeneous information across multi-view data. Furthermore, graph regularizers are also introduced to preserve the local geometric information of each view. To optimize the proposed framework, an iterative updating scheme is developed. Besides, the corresponding algorithm called MVC-DMNMF is also proposed and implemented.

There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which we refer to as ''AI Oversight''. We study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing Chance Adjusted Probabilistic Agreement (CAPA): a metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using CAPA, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we study training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from ''weak-to-strong generalization''. As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight.

 Twisted period integrals are ubiquitous in theoretical physics and mathematics, where they inhabit a finite-dimensional vector space governed by an inner product known as the intersection number. In this work, we uncover the associated tensor structures of intersection numbers and integrate them with the fibration method to develop a novel evaluation scheme. Companion matrices allow us to cast the computation of the intersection numbers in terms of a matrix operator calculus within the ambient tensor space. For illustrative purposes, our algorithm has been successfully applied to the numerical decomposition of a sample of two-loop integrals, coming from planar five-point massless functions, representing a significant advancement for the direct projection of Feynman integrals to master integrals via intersection numbers.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbcb57167121717f3f30ed138f7eaa1536cfb22f,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16668.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbcb57167121717f3f30ed138f7eaa1536cfb22f,Journal of High Energy Physics,"Physics, Mathematics, Mathematics, Physics",10,39eb190ebec258f2fcdb816fed2edaf4,10.1007/JHEP07(2025)045,2408.16668,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Parate, Mohammad Farukh Hashmi",2024,"Skin conditions are becoming increasingly prevalent across the world in current times. With the rise in dermatological disorders, there is a need for computerized techniques that are completely noninvasive to patients’ skin. As a result, deep learning models have become standard for the computerized detection of skin diseases. The performance efficiency of these models improves with access to more data with their primary aim being image classification. In this paper, we present a skin disease detection methodology using image processing techniques, non-local means denoising and convolutional neural network (CNN) backed by sparse dictionary learning. Here, the major benefit of using NLM denoising followed by sparse dictionary learning with CNNs in image classification lies in leveraging a multi-stage approach that enhances the quality of input data, extracts meaningful and discriminative features, and improves the overall performance of the classification model. This combined approach addresses challenges such as noise robustness, feature extraction, and classification accuracy, making it particularly effective in complex image analysis tasks. For denoising, the average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) obtained for images from HAM-10000 dataset is 33.59 dB. For the ISIC-2019 dataset, the average PSNR for the train folder is 34.37 dB, and for the test folder it is 34.39 dB. The deep learning network is trained for the analysis of skin cancer images using a CNN model and is achieving acceptable results in classifying skin cancer types. The datasets used contain high-resolution images.

To reduce the SSP uncertainties and draw insights into specific ocean processes, an interpretable deep dictionary learning model is proposed to cater for uncertain SSP processing. In particular, two kinds of SSP uncertainties are considered: measurement errors, which generally exist in the form of Gaussian noises; and the disturbances/anomalies caused by potential ocean dynamics, which occur at some specific depths and durations. To learn the generative patterns of these uncertainties while maintaining the interpretability of the resulting deep model, the adopted scheme first unrolls the classical K-singular value decomposition algorithm into a neural network, and trains this neural network in a supervised learning manner. The training data and model initializations are judiciously designed to incorporate the environmental properties of ocean SSPs.

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been used to extract interpretable features from individual layers, aligning these features across layers has remained an open problem. In this paper, we introduce SAE Match, a novel, data-free method for aligning SAE features across different layers of a neural network. Our approach involves matching features by minimizing the mean squared error between the folded parameters of SAEs, a technique that incorporates activation thresholds into the encoder and decoder weights to account for differences in feature scales. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma 2 language model, we demonstrate that our method effectively captures feature evolution across layers, improving feature matching quality.

The procedure to obtain the raw material is designed to maintain as much of the bioactive components as possible and to avoid expensive chemical purification. It consists of spray-drying the fruit juice obtained by squeezing the fruits, which is mixed with the aqueous extract of the pulp, i.e., the solid residue remained after fruit pressing. The resulting powder bergamot juice (PBJ) contains multiple bioactive components, in particular, among others, soluble fibers, polyphenols and amino-acid betaines, such as stachydrine and betonicine. LC-MS analysis identified 86 compounds, with hesperetin, naringenin, apigenin and eridictyol glucosides being the main components. In the second part of the paper, dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity of PBJ and of stachydrine was found, but neither of the compounds were effective in activating Nrf2. PBJ was then found to be effective in an in vivo model of a metabolic syndrome induced by a high-sugar, high-fat (HSF) diet and evidenced by a significant increase of the values related to a set of parameters: blood glucose, triglycerides, insulin resistance, systolic blood pressure, visceral adipose tissue and adiposity index. PBJ, when given to control rats, did not significantly change these values; in contrast, they were found to be greatly affected in rats receiving an HSF diet. The in vivo effect of PBJ can be ascribed not only to bergamot polyphenols with well-known anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and lipid-regulating effects, but also to the dietary fibers and to the non-phenolic constituents, such as stachydrine. Moreover, since PBJ was found to affect energy homeostasis and to regulate food intake, a mechanism on the regulation of energy homeostasis through leptin networking should also be considered and deserves further investigation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e908aa8ce364b8ab7ddbb6f4940359356759dfe,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/7/2964/pdf?version=1679821462,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e908aa8ce364b8ab7ddbb6f4940359356759dfe,Molecules,"Medicine, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Biology",9,b21477b45cb7e2a5fd9e508f90101704,10.3390/molecules28072964,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Chemistry'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Mao",2023,"Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm that trains machine learning (ML) models on clients' devices in a distributed manner without the need of transmitting clients' data to the FL server. In many applications of ML (e.g., image classification), the labels of training data need to be generated manually by human agents (e.g., recognizing and annotating objects in an image), which are usually costly and error-prone. In this paper, we study FL with crowdsourced data labeling where the local data of each participating client of FL are labeled manually by the client. We consider the strategic behavior of clients who may not make desired effort in their local data labeling and local model computation (quantified by the mini-batch size used in the stochastic gradient computation), and may misreport their local models to the FL server. We first characterize the performance bounds on the training loss as a function of clients' data labeling effort, local computation effort, and reported local models, which reveal the impacts of these factors on the training loss. With these insights, we devise Labeling and Computation Effort and local Model Elicitation (LCEME) mechanisms which incentivize strategic clients to make truthful efforts as desired by the server in local data labeling and local model computation, and also report true local models to the server. The truthful design of the LCEME mechanism exploits the non-trivial dependence of the training loss on clients' hidden efforts and private local models, and overcomes the intricate coupling in the joint elicitation of clients' efforts and local models. Under the LCEME mechanism, we characterize the server’s optimal local computation effort assignments and analyze their performance. We evaluate the proposed FL algorithms with crowdsourced data labeling and the LCEME mechanism for the MNIST-based hand-written digit classification. The results corroborate the improved learning accuracy and cost-effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f76d605fafa705e569b4f42a05d4212c542c4d0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00106,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f76d605fafa705e569b4f42a05d4212c542c4d0,IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,"Computer Science, Computer Science",9,797700628005cefa348ef714df943db5,10.1109/INFOCOM53939.2023.10228923,2302.00106,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00
4102d018cf22fa578e04b25a52863b64f137b62f,Dominantly Truthful Peer Prediction Mechanisms with a Finite Number of Tasks,Yuqing Kong,2023,"1 In the setting where participants are asked multiple similar possibly subjective multi-choice questions (e.g., Do you like Panda Express? Y/N; Do you like Chick-fil-A? Y/N), a series of peer prediction mechanisms have been designed to incentivize honest reports and some of them achieve dominantly truthfulness: Truth-telling is a dominant strategy and strictly dominates other “non-permutation strategy” with some mild conditions. However, those mechanisms require the participants to perform an infinite number of tasks. When the participants perform a finite number of tasks, these mechanisms only achieve approximated dominant truthfulness. The existence of a dominantly truthful multi-task peer prediction mechanism that only requires a finite number of tasks remains to be an open question that may have a negative result, even with full prior knowledge. This article answers this open question by proposing a family of mechanisms, VMI-Mechanisms, that are dominantly truthful with a finite number of tasks. A special case of this family, DMI-Mechanism, only requires ≥ 2C tasks where C is the number of choices for each question (C=2 for binary-choice questions). The implementation of these mechanisms does not require any prior knowledge (detail-free) and only requires ≥ 2 participants. To the best of our knowledge, any mechanism of the family is the first dominantly truthful peer prediction mechanism that works for a finite number of tasks. The core of these new mechanisms is a new family of information-monotone information measures: volume mutual information (VMI). VMI is based on a simple geometric information measure design method, the volume method. The volume method measures the informativeness of an object by “counting” the number of objects that are less informative than it. In other words, the more objects that the object of interest dominates, the more informative it is considered to be. Finally, in the setting where agents need to invest efforts to obtain their private signals, we show how to select the mechanism to optimally incentivize efforts among a proper set of VMI-Mechanisms.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4102d018cf22fa578e04b25a52863b64f137b62f,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4102d018cf22fa578e04b25a52863b64f137b62f,Journal of the ACM,"Computer Science, Economics",9,1fd9646b45dc2f2c4a43af5eb05f6abb,10.1145/3638239,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

In this paper, we suggest an analytical method for computing a mechanism design. This problem is explored in the context of a framework, in which the players follow an average utility in a non-cooperative Markov game with incomplete state information. All of the Nash equilibria are approximated in a sequential process. We describe a method for the derivative of the player’s equilibrium that instruments the design of the mechanism. In addition, it showed the convergence and rate of convergence of the proposed method. For computing the mechanism, we consider an extension of the Markov model for which it is introduced a new variable that represents the product of the mechanism design and the joint strategy. We derive formulas to recover the variables of interest: mechanisms, strategy, and distribution vector. The mechanism design and equilibrium strategies computation differ from those in previous literature.

These neglected mechanisms determine properties that are critical for safety, like (i) transparency; (ii) the absence of sensitive information or harmful capabilities; and (iii) reliable generalization of goals beyond the training distribution. To address this shortcoming, we introduce gradient routing, a training method that isolates capabilities to specific subregions of a neural network. Gradient routing applies data-dependent, weighted masks to gradients during backpropagation. These masks are supplied by the user in order to configure which parameters are updated by which data points. We show that gradient routing can be used to (1) learn representations which are partitioned in an interpretable way; (2) enable robust unlearning via ablation of a pre-specified network subregion; and (3) achieve scalable oversight of a reinforcement learner by localizing modules responsible for different behaviors. Throughout, we find that gradient routing localizes capabilities even when applied to a limited, ad-hoc subset of the data.

Chang, Hsiao-Chun Wu",2023,"The approach of least squares (LSs) has been quite popular and widely adopted for the common linear regression analysis, which can give rise to the solution to an arbitrary critically-, over-, or under-determined system. Such a linear regression analysis can be easily applied for linear estimation and equalization in signal processing for cybernetics. Nonetheless, the current LS approach for linear regression is unfortunately limited to the dimensionality of data, that is, the exact LS solution can involve only a data matrix. As the dimension of data increases and such data need to be represented by a tensor, the corresponding exact tensor-based LS (TLS) solution does not exist due to the lack of a pertinent mathematical framework. Lately, some alternatives such as tensor decomposition and tensor unfolding were proposed to approximate the TLS solutions to the linear regression problems involving tensor data, but these techniques cannot provide the exact or true TLS solution. In this work, we would like to make the first-ever attempt to present a new mathematical framework for facilitating the exact TLS solutions involving tensor data.

Sundell",2021,"When reconstructing sediment provenance, the challenge posed by multiple univariate (i.e., age-only) detrital geochronology data sets with similar one-dimensional distributions can be mitigated by incorporation of a second variable such as Hf isotopic data. However, there is no commonly applied method of sample intercomparison, much less forward or inverse modeling of these bivariate data sets. In this paper we explore application of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to bivariate data sets. Factorization of univariate mixed (a.k.a., sink or daughter) data sets has been demonstrated to successfully recover both the one-dimensional endmember (a.k.a., source or parent) distributions and their mixture weightings. We show that NMF can successfully recover both the two-dimensional distributions and mixing weights in synthetic data sets. Application of the method to 24 published Neoproterozoic–Triassic samples from western Laurentia yields six two-dimensional endmember distributions that are a close match to empirical sediment sources on the southern, eastern, and northern margin of Laurentia. The results are broadly consistent with previous interpretations and confirm that the method can characterize unknown sediment sources based on data from analyzed sink samples. Correlating between factorized endmembers and empirical sources indicates that the Transcontinental Arch was not a barrier to east–west sediment transport until the late Cambrian. Quantitative comparison also shows that the closest known match for a factorized endmember with highly evolved Permo-Triassic zircons is from northern South America and suggests northward transport of this detritus following assembly of Pangea. Recognizing these empirical sources and their distribution into strata that would later be incorporated into the North American Cordillera sets the stage for interpreting sediment provenance records in the Jurassic–Paleogene Cordilleran retroarc foreland basin.

I argue for the importance of propositional interpretability, which involves interpreting a system's mechanisms and behavior in terms of propositional attitudes: attitudes (such as belief, desire, or subjective probability) to propositions (e.g. the proposition that it is hot outside). Propositional attitudes are the central way that we interpret and explain human beings and they are likely to be central in AI too. A central challenge is what I call thought logging: creating systems that log all of the relevant propositional attitudes in an AI system over time. I examine currently popular methods of interpretability (such as probing, sparse auto-encoders, and chain of thought methods) as well as philosophical methods of interpretation (including those grounded in psychosemantics) to assess their strengths and weaknesses as methods of propositional interpretability.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff47ee9b586cbbb9090f397fe52b569fd066ff1f,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15740.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff47ee9b586cbbb9090f397fe52b569fd066ff1f,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Philosophy",9,186bf0c77a7caab0aa59c906a8038af2,10.48550/arXiv.2501.15740,2501.15740,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Philosophy'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:34.213428+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:34.213428+00:00

One approach is to develop interpretable machine learning techniques. These techniques aim to show how machine learning models function by providing either model centric local or global explanations, which can be based on mechanistic interpretations revealing the inner working mechanisms of models or nonmechanistic approximations showing input feature output data relationships. In this paper, we draw on social philosophy to argue that interpreting machine learning outputs in certain normatively salient domains could require appealing to a third type of explanation that we call sociostructural explanation. The relevance of this explanation type is motivated by the fact that machine learning models are not isolated entities but are embedded within and shaped by social structures. Sociostructural explanations aim to illustrate how social structures contribute to and partially explain the outputs of machine learning models. We demonstrate the importance of sociostructural explanations by examining a racially biased healthcare allocation algorithm. Our proposal highlights the need for transparency beyond model interpretability, understanding the outputs of machine learning systems could require a broader analysis that extends beyond the understanding of the machine learning model itself.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b4a90fba7d92ddffe37755d8942531806841ecd,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03632,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b4a90fba7d92ddffe37755d8942531806841ecd,Ai & Society,"Computer Science, Philosophy, Computer Science, Sociology",9,8c00bfb3fbd0319fe96b8bd7a4cb24b2,10.1007/s00146-024-02056-1,2409.03632,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Philosophy'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Sociology'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:31.027313+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:31.027313+00:00

Current interpretability work can extract features from hidden activations over an input dataset but generally cannot explain how MLP weights construct features. One challenge is that element-wise nonlinearities introduce higher-order interactions and make it difficult to trace computations through the MLP layer. In this paper, we analyze bilinear MLPs, a type of Gated Linear Unit (GLU) without any element-wise nonlinearity that nevertheless achieves competitive performance. Bilinear MLPs can be fully expressed in terms of linear operations using a third-order tensor, allowing flexible analysis of the weights. Analyzing the spectra of bilinear MLP weights using eigendecomposition reveals interpretable low-rank structure across toy tasks, image classification, and language modeling. We use this understanding to craft adversarial examples, uncover overfitting, and identify small language model circuits directly from the weights alone.

To address this, we introduce NOTICE, the first Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation pipeline for mechanistic interpretability in VLMs. NOTICE incorporates a Semantic Minimal Pairs (SMP) framework for image corruption and Symmetric Token Replacement (STR) for text. This approach enables semantically meaningful causal mediation analysis for both modalities, providing a robust method for analyzing multimodal integration within models like BLIP. Our experiments on the SVO-Probes, MIT-States, and Facial Expression Recognition datasets reveal crucial insights into VLM decision-making, identifying the significant role of middle-layer cross-attention heads. Further, we uncover a set of ``universal cross-attention heads'' that consistently contribute across tasks and modalities, each performing distinct functions such as implicit image segmentation, object inhibition, and outlier inhibition.

Optimizing dynamic mechanisms for welfare is relatively well understood. However, there has been less work on optimizing for other goals (e.g., revenue), and without restrictive assumptions on valuations, it is remarkably challenging to characterize good mechanisms. Instead, we turn to automated mechanism design to find mechanisms with good performance in specific problem instances.
We extend the class of affine maximizer mechanisms to MDPs where agents may untruthfully report their rewards. This extension results in a challenging bilevel optimization problem in which the upper problem involves choosing optimal mechanism parameters, and the lower problem involves solving the resulting MDP.

Shen",2024,"With the explosive development of mobile computing, federated learning (FL) has been considered as a promising distributed training framework for addressing the shortage of conventional cloud based centralized training. In FL, local model owners (LMOs) individually train their respective local models and then upload the trained local models to the task publisher (TP) for aggregation to obtain the global model. When the data provided by LMOs do not meet the requirements for model training, they can recruit workers to collect data. In this paper, by considering the interactions among the TP, LMOs and workers, we propose a three-layer hierarchical game framework. However, there are two challenges. First, information asymmetry between workers and LMOs may result in that the workers hide their types. Second, incentive mismatch between TP and LMOs may result in a lack of LMOs’ willingness to participate in FL. Therefore, we decompose the hierarchical-based framework into two layers to address these challenges. For the lower-layer, we leverage the contract theory to ensure truthful reporting of the workers’ types, based on which we simplify the feasible conditions of the contract and design the optimal contract. For the upper-layer, the Stackelberg game is adopted to model the interactions between the TP and LMOs, and we derive the Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg equilibrium solutions. Moreover, we develop an iterative Hierarchical-based Utility Maximization Algorithm (HUMA) to solve the coupling problem between upper-layer and lower-layer games.

However, in practice, some information that is essential for centralized management is usually privately known, which provides incentives for strategic behaviors of drivers and could lead to suboptimal system performance. We design a two‐step mechanism and prove that, in step 1, drivers’ choices of whether or not to enter the managed system following the approximate optimal solution satisfy Bayesian‐Nash equilibrium (BNE), and in step 2, that truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for all drivers under any circumstance.

This model brings most drivers few yields, resulting in their withdrawals. In contrast, a similar market termed MOD-Human-Crowdsensing (MOMAN-CS) remains successful thanks to a complex model based on exclusively customized rewards. Hence, we wonder whether MOVE-CS can be resurrected by learning from MOMAN-CS. Despite considerable similarity, we can hardly apply the incentive model of MOMAN-CS to MOVE-CS, since MOD drivers are also concerned with passenger missions that dominate their earnings. To this end, we analyze a large-scale dataset of 12,493 MOD vehicles, finding that drivers have explicit preference for short-term, immediate gains as well as implicit rationality in pursuit of long-term, stable profits. Therefore, we design a novel driver-oriented incentive mechanism for MOVE-CS, called LSTAloc, at the heart of which lies a spatial-temporal differentiation-aware task allocation scheme empowered by submodular optimization.

Based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in each iteration, the framework first applies a hallucination annotation pipeline to annotate a scaled dataset and then trains a more accurate hallucination annotator on the dataset. This new hallucination annotator is adopted in the hallucination annotation pipeline used for the next iteration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the finally obtained hallucination annotator with only 7B parameters surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and obtains new state-of-the-art hallucination detection results on HaluEval and HalluQA by zero-shot inference.

In this note, I examine bilinear layers, which are a type of MLP layer that are mathematically much easier to analyze while simultaneously performing better than standard MLPs. Although they are nonlinear functions of their input, I demonstrate that bilinear layers can be expressed using only linear operations and third order tensors. We can integrate this expression for bilinear layers into a mathematical framework for transformer circuits, which was previously limited to attention-only transformers. These results suggest that bilinear layers are easier to analyze mathematically than current architectures and thus may lend themselves to deeper safety insights by allowing us to talk more formally about circuits in neural networks.

Auxiliary information is often judged to be equally valued, which will dissipate some of the valuable information. Hence, we propose a novel POI recommendation method fusing auxiliary attribute information based on the neural matrix factorization, integrating the convolutional neural network and attention mechanism (NueMF-CAA). First, the k-means and term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithms are used to mine the auxiliary attribute information of users and POIs from user check-in data to alleviate the data-sparsity problem. A convolutional neural network and an attention mechanism are applied to learn the expression of auxiliary attribute information and distinguish the importance of auxiliary attribute information, respectively. Then, the auxiliary attribute information feature vectors of users and POIs are concatenated with their respective latent feature vectors to obtain the complete latent feature vectors of users and POIs. Meanwhile, generalized matrix factorization (GMF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are used to learn the linear and nonlinear interactions between users and POIs, respectively, and the last hidden layer is connected to integrate the two parts to alleviate the implicit feedback problem and make the recommendation results more interpretable. Experiments on two real-world datasets, the Foursquare dataset and the Weibo dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the evaluation metrics—hit ratio (HR) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40aa1306e2f1c50d7f00f63e995d9b82006e5080,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/19/3411/pdf?version=1663639445,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40aa1306e2f1c50d7f00f63e995d9b82006e5080,Mathematics,Computer Science,8,aa5a7ae41940e07dd11f901b4a237e96,10.3390/math10193411,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

Its one-wave version relies on the absence of analytical continuation of the scattered/radiated wave-fields in corner domains. It can be regarded as a domain-defined sampling method and does not require forward solvers. In this paper we provide a rigorous mathematical justification of the one-wave factorization method and present some preliminary numerical examples.

In total, twelve CNN and preprocessing configurations are analyzed, focusing on the trade-offs between preprocessing complexity and recognition accuracy, all of which are essential for real-time applications. Among these results, MobileNetV2, combined with STFT preprocessing, showed an ideal balance, achieving high computational efficiency and an accuracy rate of 96.30%, with a spectrogram generation time of 220 ms and an inference time of 2.57 ms per sample.

This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries for mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons. Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable, remain fixed-parameter intractable relative to model/circuit features, and inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability or fixed-parameter tractability of more modest queries which retain useful affordances.

Despite recent progress toward this goal, it remains unclear how best to decompose neural network parameters into mechanistic components. We introduce Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), a method that directly decomposes a neural network's parameters into components that (i) are faithful to the parameters of the original network, (ii) require a minimal number of components to process any input, and (iii) are maximally simple. Our approach thus optimizes for a minimal length description of the network's mechanisms. We demonstrate APD's effectiveness by successfully identifying ground truth mechanisms in multiple toy experimental settings: Recovering features from superposition; separating compressed computations; and identifying cross-layer distributed representations. While challenges remain to scaling APD to non-toy models, our results suggest solutions to several open problems in mechanistic interpretability, including identifying minimal circuits in superposition, offering a conceptual foundation for 'features', and providing an architecture-agnostic framework for neural network decomposition.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a365128aa7b41478bf5251793a691d8b5d8ff27,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14926.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a365128aa7b41478bf5251793a691d8b5d8ff27,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",8,43ebb1b54a00f1926299238c8840b949,10.48550/arXiv.2501.14926,2501.14926,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:27.826529+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:59.699000+00:00

These degenerate parameters may obfuscate internal structure. Singular learning theory teaches us that neural network parameterizations are biased towards being more degenerate, and parameterizations with more degeneracy are likely to generalize further. We identify 3 ways that network parameters can be degenerate: linear dependence between activations in a layer; linear dependence between gradients passed back to a layer; ReLUs which fire on the same subset of datapoints. We also present a heuristic argument that modular networks are likely to be more degenerate, and we develop a metric for identifying modules in a network that is based on this argument. We propose that if we can represent a neural network in a way that is invariant to reparameterizations that exploit the degeneracies, then this representation is likely to be more interpretable, and we provide some evidence that such a representation is likely to have sparser interactions.

Ramchurn, Nick Bassiliades",2020,"The industry related to electric vehicles (EVs) has seen a substantial increase in recent years, as such vehicles have the ability to significantly reduce total CO2 emissions and the related global warming effect. In this paper, we focus on the problem of allocating EVs to charging stations, scheduling and pricing their charging. Specifically, we developed a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) which executes offline and optimally allocates EVs to charging stations. On top, we propose two alternative mechanisms to price the electricity the EVs charge. The first mechanism is a typical fixed-price one, while the second is a variation of the Vickrey–Clark–Groves (VCG) mechanism. We also developed online solutions that incrementally call the MIP-based algorithm and solve it for branches of EVs. In all cases, the EVs’ aim is to minimize the price to pay and the impact on their driving schedule, acting as self-interested agents. We conducted a thorough empirical evaluation of our mechanisms and we observed that they had satisfactory scalability. Additionally, the VCG mechanism achieved an up to 2.2% improvement in terms of the number of vehicles that were charged compared to the fixed-price one and, in cases where the stations were congested, it calculated higher prices for the EVs and provided a higher profit for the stations, but lower utility to the EVs. However, in a theoretical evaluation, we proved that the variant of the VCG mechanism being proposed in this paper still guaranteed truthful reporting of the EVs’ preferences. In contrast, the fixed-price one was found to be vulnerable to agents’ strategic behavior as non-truthful EVs can charge instead of truthful ones.

Due to the openness of mobile crowdsourcing, workers may yield low-quality task answers. To alleviate this problem, substantial efforts have been devoted to elicit truthful data from workers. On the other hand, to facilitate task assignment, workers are required to upload the platform their profiles, such as locations and expertise. Therefore, task assignment outcomes and thus mobile crowdsourcing service accuracy is subject to the quality of workers’ self-reported profiles. In this paper, we leverage incentive design to motivate workers to honestly reveal both task answers and their profiles. The challenge is to design one incentive payment for truth elicitation in two kinds of submissions. For this, we first derive the sufficient and necessary conditions for answer truthfulness and profile truthfulness separately. We then construct an incentive optimization problem that incorporates these conditions as constraints. Its optimal solution lists the payment to each worker that elicits answers and profiles jointly.

Due to limited sensing-computation resource and data security risk, it is necessary to design an efficient incentive mechanism to motivate MUs to complete crowdsourcing task. In this article, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based contract incentive mechanism is proposed by jointly considering participation contribution, sensing task, and computation resource of MUs. Specifically, considering the heterogeneous willingness of the MUs, we formulate a 3-D sensing-computation-reward contract incentive mechanism to obtain the maximum utility of mobile crowdsourcing platform. Moreover, based on the individual rationality and incentive compatibility constraints, we derive the optimal contract under the partial information asymmetry scenario. In the case of the complete information asymmetry scenario, we formulate the contract incentive issue as an Markov decision process. Considering the infinite and continuous action and state spaces, we develop the deep deterministic method to obtain the efficient sensing task, computation resource, and incentive reward policy.

fc13fa57b21fa9882b821cbb5fa910451f35be7e,Mechanism Design for Collaborative Normal Mean Estimation,"Yiding Chen, Xiaojin Zhu, Kirthevasan Kandasamy",2023,"We study collaborative normal mean estimation, where $m$ strategic agents collect i.i.d samples from a normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ at a cost. They all wish to estimate the mean $\mu$. By sharing data with each other, agents can obtain better estimates while keeping the cost of data collection small. To facilitate this collaboration, we wish to design mechanisms that encourage agents to collect a sufficient amount of data and share it truthfully, so that they are all better off than working alone. In naive mechanisms, such as simply pooling and sharing all the data, an individual agent might find it beneficial to under-collect and/or fabricate data, which can lead to poor social outcomes. We design a novel mechanism that overcomes these challenges via two key techniques: first, when sharing the others' data with an agent, the mechanism corrupts this dataset proportional to how much the data reported by the agent differs from the others; second, we design minimax optimal estimators for the corrupted dataset. Our mechanism, which is Nash incentive compatible and individually rational, achieves a social penalty (sum of all agents' estimation errors and data collection costs) that is at most a factor 2 of the global minimum. When applied to high dimensional (non-Gaussian) distributions with bounded variance, this mechanism retains these three properties, but with slightly weaker results. Finally, in two special cases where we restrict the strategy space of the agents, we design mechanisms that essentially achieve the global minimum.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc13fa57b21fa9882b821cbb5fa910451f35be7e,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06351,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc13fa57b21fa9882b821cbb5fa910451f35be7e,Neural Information Processing Systems,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",7,c3339d6d155b40b88431b79d7e52e4d1,10.48550/arXiv.2306.06351,2306.06351,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Keijzer, Carmine Ventre",2023,"Recent work in algorithmic mechanism design focuses on designing mechanisms for agents with bounded rationality, modifying the constraints that must be satisfied in order to achieve incentive compatibility. Starting with Li's strengthening of strategyproofness, obvious strategyproofness (OSP) requires truthtelling to be ""obvious"" over dishonesty, roughly meaning that the worst outcome from truthful actions must be no worse than the best outcome for dishonest ones. A celebrated result for dominant-strategy incentive-compatible mechanisms that allows us to restrict attention to direct mechanisms, known as the revelation principle, does not hold for OSP: the implementation details matter for the obvious incentive properties of the mechanism. Studying agent strategies in real-life mechanisms, Troyan and Morrill introduce a relaxation of strategyproofness known as non-obvious manipulability, which only requires comparing certain extrema of the agents' utility functions in order for a mechanism to be incentive-compatible. Specifically a mechanism is not obviously manipulable (NOM) if the best and worst outcomes when acting truthfully are no worse than the best and worst outcomes when acting dishonestly. In this work we first extend the cycle monotonicity framework for direct-revelation NOM mechanism design to indirect mechanisms. We then apply this to two settings, single-parameter agents and mechanisms for two agents in which one has a two-value domain, and show that under these models the revelation principle holds: direct mechanisms are just as powerful as indirect ones.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37b6bc61ae732fe8972a4650f283a58678f210af,https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0278.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37b6bc61ae732fe8972a4650f283a58678f210af,International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Computer Science, Economics, Computer Science",7,eabca2fbcba150fe2e41c2fc6b62f097,10.24963/ijcai.2023/278,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Dahleh",2020,"A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid is the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification has the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that are not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This is referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key milestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation sectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully, then contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could in fact be counterproductive to it. This occurs due to two phenomena operating in tandem — the randomness of EV usage patterns and the possibility of strategic behavior by EV users. We present a market-based solution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy storage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a fleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them for storage, and satisfy the demand at the minimum possible cost.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5d41335d45f0a4a7aae9e9abb543e9d3d9ca19d,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11540,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5d41335d45f0a4a7aae9e9abb543e9d3d9ca19d,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,"Computer Science, Engineering, Economics, Environmental Science, Engineering",7,07f0e03dbf0038d177d1c1671c0db2a5,10.1109/tsg.2022.3145689,2012.11540,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Doan",2022,"The dynamics of a turbulent flow tend to occupy only a portion of the phase space at a statistically stationary regime. From a dynamical systems point of view, this portion is the attractor. The knowledge of the turbulent attractor is useful for two purposes, at least: (i) We can gain physical insight into turbulence (what is the shape and geometry of the attractor?), and (ii) it provides the minimal number of degrees of freedom to accurately describe the turbulent dynamics. Autoencoders enable the computation of an optimal latent space, which is a low-order representation of the dynamics. If properly trained and correctly designed, autoencoders can learn an approximation of the turbulent attractor, as shown by Doan, Racca and Magri (2022). In this paper, we theoretically interpret the transformations of an autoencoder. First, we remark that the latent space is a curved manifold with curvilinear coordinates, which can be analyzed with simple tools from Riemann geometry. Second, we characterize the geometrical properties of the latent space. We mathematically derive the metric tensor, which provides a mathematical description of the manifold. Third, we propose a method -- proper latent decomposition (PLD) -- that generalizes proper orthogonal decomposition of turbulent flows on the autoencoder latent space. This decomposition finds the dominant directions in the curved latent space. This theoretical work opens up computational opportunities for interpreting autoencoders and creating reduced-order models of turbulent flows.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b54c2268dc2c3694096c86a02b1493115ce2452,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08345,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b54c2268dc2c3694096c86a02b1493115ce2452,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Physics, Computer Science, Physics",7,2e408ba42cf97ca558391a10eb6989d2,10.48550/arXiv.2211.08345,2211.08345,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Lathauwer",2021,"The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a low rank tensor plays a major role in data analysis and signal processing by allowing for unique recovery of underlying factors. However, it is well known that the low rank CPD approximation problem is ill-posed. That is, a tensor may fail to have a best rank $R$ CPD approximation when $R>1$. This article gives deterministic bounds for the existence of best low rank tensor approximations over $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$. More precisely, given a tensor $\mathcal{T} \in \mathbb{K}^{I \times I \times I}$ of rank $R \leq I$, we compute the radius of a Frobenius norm ball centered at $\mathcal{T}$ in which best $\mathbb{K}$-rank $R$ approximations are guaranteed to exist. In addition we show that every $\mathbb{K}$-rank $R$ tensor inside of this ball has a unique canonical polyadic decomposition. This neighborhood may be interpreted as a neighborhood of""mathematical truth""in with CPD approximation and computation is well-posed. In pursuit of these bounds, we describe low rank tensor decomposition as a ``joint generalized eigenvalue""problem. Using this framework, we show that, under mild assumptions, a low rank tensor which has rank strictly greater than border rank is defective in the sense of algebraic and geometric multiplicities for joint generalized eigenvalues. Bounds for existence of best low rank approximations are then obtained by establishing perturbation theoretic results for the joint generalized eigenvalue problem. In this way we establish a connection between existence of best low rank approximations and the tensor spectral norm. In addition we solve a""tensor Procrustes problem""which examines orthogonal compressions for pairs of tensors. The main results of the article are illustrated by a variety of numerical experiments.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65db2607044a4d272831fa60177a6536029faf71,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/20.500.12942/686145/2/evert2021jgevddeflation.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65db2607044a4d272831fa60177a6536029faf71,SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications,"Mathematics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",7,767355d086608848e350d905870945ff,10.1137/20m1381046,2112.08283,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Mura, Lucas Drumetz, Pierre Comon",2023,"Hyperspectral unmixing allows representing mixed pixels as a set of pure materials weighted by their abundances. Spectral features alone are often insufficient, so it is common to rely on other features of the scene. Matrix models become insufficient when the hyperspectral image (HSI) is represented as a high-order tensor with additional features in a multimodal, multifeature framework. Tensor models such as canonical polyadic decomposition allow for this kind of unmixing but lack a general framework and interpretability of the results. In this article, we propose an interpretable methodological framework for low-rank multifeature hyperspectral unmixing based on tensor decomposition (MultiHU-TD) that incorporates the abundance sum-to-one constraint in the alternating optimization alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and provide in-depth mathematical, physical, and graphical interpretation and connections with the extended linear mixing model. As additional features, we propose to incorporate mathematical morphology and reframe a previous work on neighborhood patches within MultiHU-TD. Experiments on real HSIs showcase the interpretability of the model and the analysis of the results.

Nalepa, Karol Najdek, Bl Strong",2020,"In this paper the D-decomposition technique is investigated as a source of non-linear boundaries used with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) search of a PI voltage compensator gains of the boost converter operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM). The well known and appreciated boost converter has been chosen as a test object due to its right-half plane zero in the control-to-output (c2o) voltage transfer function. The D-decomposition, as a technique relying on the frequency sweeping, clearly indicates not only the global stability but, in its extended version, regions satisfying the required gain (GM) and phase (PM) margins. Such results are in form of easy to interpret functions KI=f(KP). The functions are easy to convert to the GA constraints. The GA search, with three different performance indexes as the fitness functions, is applied to a control structure with time delays basing on identified c2o voltage transfer functions. The identification took place in an experiment and in simulation. Outcomes of the identification are compared to mathematically derived formula taking into account certain parasitics.

Sheng, D. Farina, Xiangyang Zhu",2021,"Objective: Mathematical modelling of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals has been proven a valuable tool to interpret experimental data and to validate signal processing techniques. Most analytical EMG models only consider muscle fibers with specific arrangements. However, the fiber orientation may change along the fiber paths and differ from fiber to fiber. Here we propose a subject-specific EMG model that simulates the fiber trajectories in muscles of the upper arm and analytically derives the action potentials assuming an approximate conductivity tensor. Methods: Magnetic Resonance (MR) images were acquired to generate muscle fiber paths and to build the volume conductor. While the action potentials propagated along the identified curvilinear fibers, the conductivity tensor was approximated to be cylindrically anisotropic. Single fiber action potentials (SFAPs) were computed by simulating the generation, propagation, and extinction of membrane current sources. To validate the assumption of the approximate conductivity tensor, two numerical models with approximate or exact conductivity tensors were implemented. Results: The motor unit action potentials generated by the proposed analytical model and the two numerical models were highly similar (cross-correlation $>$0.98, normalized root mean square error, nRMSE $\leq$ 0.04, relative error in the median frequency of the simulated waveforms of approximately 3%). The proposed analytical model was also evaluated by comparing simulated and experimentally recorded compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). Finally, the proposed model was used to test the accuracy of an EMG decomposition algorithm, providing a realistic benchmark. Conclusions and Significance: The proposed analytical model generates action potentials that reflect the spatial distributions of muscle fibers with curvilinear paths.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46f6fb9d718651d07bbb6b66bfe5eb2d12066d97,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46f6fb9d718651d07bbb6b66bfe5eb2d12066d97,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,"Computer Science, Medicine, Engineering, Medicine",7,8361ad9374550d3ba30db9e028a44d9d,10.1109/TBME.2021.3112766,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

In a MIMO multi-radar setup, we demonstrate its effectiveness in jointly detecting and localizing multiple objects, while also emphasizing its broader applicability to various signal processing tasks. A key benefit of the proposed SBL-based method is its ability to resolve correlated dictionary entries-such as closely spaced objects-resulting in uncorrelated estimates that improve subsequent estimation stages.

Kaleem, A. Guergachi, S. Krishnan",2021,"Analysis of long-term multichannel EEG signals for automatic seizure detection is an active area of research that has seen application of methods from different domains of signal processing and machine learning. The majority of approaches developed in this context consist of extraction of hand-crafted features that are used to train a classifier for eventual seizure detection. Approaches that are data-driven, do not use hand-crafted features, and use small amounts of patients' historical EEG data for classifier training are few in number. The approach presented in this paper falls in the latter category, and is based on a signal-derived empirical dictionary approach, which utilizes empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based dictionaries learned using a framework inspired by traditional methods of dictionary learning. Three features associated with traditional dictionary learning approaches, namely projection coefficients, coefficient vector and reconstruction error, are extracted from both EMD and DWT based dictionaries for automated seizure detection. This is the first time these features have been applied for automatic seizure detection using an empirical dictionary approach. Small amounts of patients' historical multi-channel EEG data are used for classifier training, and multiple classifiers are used for seizure detection using newer data. In addition, the seizure detection results are validated using 5-fold cross-validation to rule out any bias in the results. The CHB-MIT benchmark database containing long-term EEG recordings of pediatric patients is used for validation of the approach, and seizure detection performance comparable to the state-of-the-art is obtained. Seizure detection is performed using five classifiers, thereby allowing a comparison of the dictionary approaches, features extracted, and classifiers used. The best seizure detection performance is obtained using EMD based dictionary and reconstruction error feature and support vector machine classifier, with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 88.2, 90.3, and 88.1%, respectively. Comparison is also made with other recent studies using the same database. The methodology presented in this paper is shown to be computationally efficient and robust for patient-specific automatic seizure detection. A data-driven methodology utilizing a small amount of patients' historical data is hence demonstrated as a practical solution for automatic seizure detection.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b9278ee979babc6c76ab979d40ecde95dbe27fc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8710482,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b9278ee979babc6c76ab979d40ecde95dbe27fc,Frontiers in Digital Health,"Medicine, Computer Science, Computer Science, Medicine",7,359540de7ba055990efd3fa7e3b25e59,10.3389/fdgth.2021.738996,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Bai, Zixiang Zhou, Yangkang Chen",2024,"Seismic data acquired from the field inevitably suffer from noise pollution, which covers the useful signals and affects the reliability of subsequent seismic data processing and interpretation. Many 2-D multichannel seismic denoising methods depend on the assumption that the receiver array is spatial coherent in field microseismic data acquisition, which limits their performance when dealing with field data. However, the single-channel methods are more flexible when faced with real microseismic data because they do not require any assumptions regarding spatial coherency. Therefore, we propose a 1-D dictionary learning (DL) framework based on variational sparse representation to suppress background noise in seismic data. Compared with the 2-D multichannel denoising method, the proposed method takes into account the waveform characteristics and requires no spatial coherency of single-channel seismic data, thus achieving better denoising performance. In addition, the 1-D DL method requires fewer training samples than the 2-D method to reach a promising result, thereby causing less consumption time. Numerical results show that compared with bandpass (BP) filtering, structure-oriented filtering (SOF), and K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) methods, the proposed DL framework can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of seismic data and protect effective signals better without causing extra computation. Furthermore, we discuss how to further suppress the residual horizontal noise and erratic noise based on the proposed method.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0a51d13e04ae96a3fa3504287da0a091c74ce98,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0a51d13e04ae96a3fa3504287da0a091c74ce98,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"Computer Science, Engineering, Geology",7,9042fba63245592ad7ac8a37756d049a,10.1109/TGRS.2024.3400313,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Geology'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

In this study, based on dictionary learning and sparse coding, we modified the super-resolution technique and applied it to seafloor topographical maps. Improving on the conventional method, before dictionary learning, we performed pre-processing to separate the teacher image into a low-frequency component that has a general structure and a high-frequency component that captures the detailed topographical features. We learn the topographical features by training the dictionary. As a result, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was reduced by 30% compared with bicubic interpolation and accuracy was improved, especially in the rugged part of the terrain.

Signal decomposition is traditionally achieved by projecting data onto predefined basis functions, often known as atoms. Coefficient manipulation (e.g., thresholding) combined with signal reconstruction then either provides signals with enhanced quality or permits extraction of desired features only. More recently dictionary learning and deep learning have also been actively used for similar tasks. The purpose of dictionary learning is to derive the most appropriate basis functions directly from the observed data. In deep learning, neural networks or other transfer functions are taught to perform either feature classification or data enhancement directly, provided solely some training data. This review shows first how popular signal processing methods, such as basis pursuit and sparse coding, are related to analysis and synthesis. We then explain how dictionary learning and deep learning using neural networks can also be interpreted as generalized analysis and synthesis methods.

We design a simple, efficient and truthful mechanism to elicit self-evaluations from item owners that can be used to calibrate their noisy review scores in the existing evaluation process (e.g., papers' review scores from peers). Our approach starts by partitioning the owner-item relation structure into disjoint blocks, each sharing a common set of co-owners. We then elicit the ranking of items from each owner and employ isotonic regression to produce adjusted item scores, aligning with both the reported rankings and raw item review scores. We prove that truth-telling by all owners is a payoff dominant Nash equilibrium for any valid partition of the overlapping ownership sets under natural conditions. Moreover, the truthfulness depends on eliciting rankings independently within each block, making block partition optimization crucial for improving statistical efficiency. Despite being computationally intractable in general, we develop a nearly linear-time greedy algorithm that provably finds a performant block partition with appealing robust approximation guarantees.

Tsang",2020,"This paper concerns the mechanism design for online resource allocation in a strategic setting. In this setting, a single supplier allocates capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request. The supplier charges payment from agents whose requests are satisfied, but incurs a load-dependent supply cost. The goal is to design an incentive compatible online mechanism, which determines not only the resource allocation of each request, but also the payment of each agent, so as to (approximately) maximize the social welfare (i.e., aggregate valuations minus supply cost). We study this problem under the framework of competitive analysis. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a unified approach that achieves the best-possible competitive ratios for setups with different supply costs. Specifically, we show that when there is no supply cost or the supply cost function is linear, our model is essentially a standard 0-1 knapsack problem, for which our approach achieves logarithmic competitive ratios that match the state-of-the-art (which is optimal). For the more challenging setup when the supply cost is strictly-convex, we provide online mechanisms, for the first time, that lead to the optimal competitive ratios as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that unifies the characterization of optimal competitive ratios in online resource allocation for different setups including zero, linear and strictly-convex supply costs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc0ad8bf4dae7f19ac744bd8e176c7f6295e3f76,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc0ad8bf4dae7f19ac744bd8e176c7f6295e3f76,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,"Computer Science, Economics, Computer Science",6,7d8a747787cd125dfc83c7f5cd738da8,10.1145/3392142,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Due to the cognitive defects of the blockchain protocol in terms of intelligent contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), it is often unclear as to how to make decisions about the evolution of blockchain applications. Many autonomous organizations, with the support of network technologies such as blockchain, blindly absorb members and expand the scale of the capital pool, while ignoring the cost advantage of traditional autonomous organizations based on social relations and mutual supervision to fight information asymmetry. In this context, this study analyzes the evolutionary trend of autonomous organizations and their members’ strategies under different policy environments. To this end, under the digital economy background, based on game theory, the evolutionary dynamics method, and the form of the mutual insurance organization, this study constructs an evolutionary dynamics model of distributed autonomous organizations. The results show that blind expansion without review aggravates the overall risk pool’s moral hazard, in the context of mutual insurance. Organizational strategies, such as risk pool splits, can effectively improve the risk pool’s operating performance and establish a benign competition elimination mechanism. Driven by cooperation efficiency and split supervision based on homogeneous clustering, the comprehensive application of the market elimination mechanism can effectively combat moral hazards, restrain the adverse effects of member flow, expand the living space of small- and medium-sized insurance organizations, curb the emergence of a large-scale monopoly risk pool, and improve market vitality. These conclusions and suggestions also apply to autonomous organizations based on social relations and mutual supervision.

Considering that the RSU may not always meet computation requirements of task vehicles (TVs), utilizing idle computing resources of the surrounding resource vehicles (RVs) becomes a feasible solution to enhance the TVs’ experience. Due to the self-interested property and limited resource of RVs, an efficient incentive mechanism should be designed to encourage RVs to participate in task offloading and resource cooperation. In this work, a deep reinforcement learning-assisted contract incentive mechanism is investigated by considering TVs’ task offloading requirements, RVs’ computation resources, and the RSU’s transmission time incentive. To truthfully reveal TV-RV task-resource coordination types, a contract is designed with computation task-transmission time contract items. The joint task offloading and resource cooperation optimization issue is formulated to maximize the RSU’s utility with incentive compatible (IR), individual rationality (IC), and task offloading constraints. The optimal transmission time strategy is first derived from IR and IC constraints. To obtain the task offloading and task data size strategies, a Markov decision process is formulated. A multiagent parametrized deep Q-network scheme is developed to handle the discrete-continuous hybrid action space problem.

This approach promises a low‐resource, ultra‐fast, and highly scalable approach to measuring emissions at different levels of potential policy intervention—spanning the national, subnational, local, and individual level. Despite this potential, there is a lack of research exploring the validity of this approach to carbon profiling. Here we address this oversight in three ways. First, we provide a step‐by‐step description of our approach toward estimating carbon footprints from micro‐level transaction data generated by more than 100,000 customers of a large retail bank in the United Kingdom. Second, we quantitatively compare emission estimates obtained from transaction data with those calculated from a more standard data source used in carbon profiling, the largest household expenditure survey in the United Kingdom. Third, we offer a detailed qualitative comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of transactions versus alternative data sources (such as survey data), across key dimensions including data availability, data quality, and data detail. We find that financial transactions offer a credible alternative to survey‐based sources and, if made more widely accessible, could provide important advantages for profiling emissions.

Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management. To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a scalable Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents'lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agent contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, providing formal security guarantees. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions.

Therefore, understanding the collective evolution of synaptic connectivity over learning is a key challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. In particular, recent work has shown that the weight matrices of task-trained RNNs are typically low rank, but how this low rank structure unfolds over learning is unknown. To address this, we investigate the rank of the 3-tensor formed by the weight matrices throughout learning. By fitting RNNs of varying rank to large-scale neural recordings during a motor learning task, we find that the inferred weights are low-tensor-rank and therefore evolve over a fixed low-dimensional subspace throughout the entire course of learning. We next validate the observation of low-tensor-rank learning on an RNN trained to solve the same task by performing a low-tensor-rank decomposition directly on the ground truth weights, and by showing that the method we applied to the data faithfully recovers this low rank structure. Finally, we present a set of mathematical results bounding the matrix and tensor ranks of gradient descent learning dynamics which show that low-tensor-rank weights emerge naturally in RNNs trained to solve low-dimensional tasks.

Vermeirssen",2022,"Representing the complex interplay between different types of biomolecules across different omics layers in multi-omics networks bears great potential to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of gene regulation and disease. However, multi-omics networks easily grow into giant hairball structures that hamper biological interpretation. Module detection methods can decompose these networks into smaller interpretable modules. However, these methods are not adapted to deal with multi-omics data nor consider topological features. When deriving very large modules or ignoring the broader network context, interpretability remains limited. To address these issues, we developed a SUbgraph BAsed mulTi-OMIcs Clustering framework (SUBATOMIC), which infers small and interpretable modules with a specific topology while keeping track of connections to other modules and regulators. SUBATOMIC groups specific molecular interactions in composite network subgraphs of two and three nodes and clusters them into topological modules. These are functionally annotated, visualized and overlaid with expression profiles to go from static to dynamic modules. To preserve the larger network context, SUBATOMIC investigates statistically the connections in between modules as well as between modules and regulators such as miRNAs and transcription factors. We applied SUBATOMIC to analyze a composite Homo sapiens network containing transcription factor-target gene, miRNA-target gene, protein–protein, homologous and co-functional interactions from different databases. We derived and annotated 5586 modules with diverse topological, functional and regulatory properties. We created novel functional hypotheses for unannotated genes. Furthermore, we integrated modules with condition specific expression data to study the influence of hypoxia in three cancer cell lines. We developed two prioritization strategies to identify the most relevant modules in specific biological contexts: one considering GO term enrichments and one calculating an activity score reflecting the degree of differential expression. Both strategies yielded modules specifically reacting to low oxygen levels. We developed the SUBATOMIC framework that generates interpretable modules from integrated multi-omics networks and applied it to hypoxia in cancer.

Acknowledging that the underlying working mechanism of OK lens is essentially mechanics induced refractive parameter reshaping, in this study, we develop a novel mechanics rule guided deep image-to-image learning framework, which densely predicts patient’s corneal topography change according to treatment parameters (lens geometry, wearing time, physiological parameters, etc.), and consecutively predicts the influence on eye axial length change after OK treatment. Encapsulated in a U-shaped multi-resolution map-to-map architecture, the proposed model features two major components. First, geometric and wearing parameters of OK lens are spatially encoded with convolutions to form a multi-channel input volume/tensor for latent encodings of external stress/tension applied to different regions of cornea. Second, these external latent force maps are progressively down-sampled and injected into this multi-scale architecture for predicting the change of corneal topography map. At each feature learning layer, we formally derive a mathematic framework that simulates the physical process of corneal deformation induced by lens-to-cornea interaction and corneal internal tension, which is reformulated into parameter learnable cross-attention/self-attention modules in the context of transformer architecture. A total of 1854 eyes of myopia patients are included in the study and the results show that the proposed model precisely predicts corneal topography change with a high PSNR as 28.45dB, as well as a significant accuracy gain for axial elongation prediction (i.e., 0.0276 in MSE).

Kurihara",2020,"Factorization machines (FMs) are machine learning predictive models based on second-order feature interactions and FMs with sparse regularization are called sparse FMs. Such regularizations enable feature selection, which selects the most relevant features for accurate prediction, and therefore they can contribute to the improvement of the model accuracy and interpretability. However, because FMs use second-order feature interactions, the selection of features often cause the loss of many relevant feature interactions in the resultant models. In such cases, FMs with regularization specially designed for feature interaction selection trying to achieve interaction-level sparsity may be preferred instead of those just for feature selection trying to achieve feature-level sparsity. In this paper, we present a new regularization scheme for feature interaction selection in FMs. The proposed regularizer is an upper bound of the $\ell_1$ regularizer for the feature interaction matrix, which is computed from the parameter matrix of FMs. For feature interaction selection, our proposed regularizer makes the feature interaction matrix sparse without a restriction on sparsity patterns imposed by the existing methods. We also describe efficient proximal algorithms for the proposed FMs and present theoretical analyses of both existing and the new regularize. In addition, we will discuss how our ideas can be applied or extended to more accurate feature selection and other related models such as higher-order FMs and the all-subsets model.

b0f04c3df28c88c6a800f5d73310fd6b0b21ec6b,SigRecover: Recovering Signal from Noise in Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data Processing,Yangkang Chen,2024,"
 Because of the harsh deployment environment of the fibers, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data usually suffer from the low signal-to-noise ratio issue. Many methods, whether simple but efficient or sophisticated but effective, have been proposed for dealing with noise and recovering signals from DAS data. However, no matter what methods we apply, we will inevitably damage the signals, more or less, resulting in coherent signal leakage in the removed noise. Here, we present a method (SigRecover) for minimizing signal leakage by recovering useful signals from removed noise and its open-source package (see Data and Resources). We apply a robust dictionary learning framework to retrieve the coherent signals from removed noise that can be captured by a pretrained library of atoms (features). The atoms are obtained by a fast dictionary-learning approach from the initially denoised data. The proposed framework is a self-learning methodology, which does not require additional training datasets and thus is conveniently applicable to any input data. We use three well-processed examples from the literature to demonstrate the generic performance of the proposed method. The idea behind this article is inspired by similar methods widely used in the exploration seismology community for retrieving signal leakage and is promising not only for DAS data processing, but also for all other multichannel seismological datasets.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0f04c3df28c88c6a800f5d73310fd6b0b21ec6b,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0f04c3df28c88c6a800f5d73310fd6b0b21ec6b,Seismological Research Letters,"Engineering, Physics",6,c92feaf3004c460c5ca61dbd13e7cff2,10.1785/0220230370,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

 Passive seismic denoising is mostly performed using a simple band-pass filter, which can be problematic when signal and noise share the same frequency band. More advanced passive seismic denoising methods take advantage of fixed-basis transforms, for example, the wavelet, to remove noise. Here, we present an open-source package for data-driven denoising based on adaptively learning sparse transform. Contrary to the fixed-basis transforms, the proposed method belongs to the adaptive-basis transforms. We learn the 1D features embedded in the passive seismic data from all the available waveform data sets without requiring spatial coherency in a data-driven way. Thus, the new method is flexible to apply in any passive seismic monitoring project because of its data-driven and single-channel nature when implemented. Considering the computationally expensive K-singular-value-decomposition (KSVD) in the traditional dictionary learning framework, we suggest applying a fast SVD-free dictionary learning method that can be readily applicable to process massive seismic data during passive seismic monitoring. The proposed method is applied to two synthetic data examples and three real passive seismic data sets to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the signal-to-noise ratio, and its potential in applications like arrival picking.

Sacchi, Jinghuai Gao",2023,"Convolutional dictionary learning (CDL) can represent signals and images via the superposition of components given by the convolution of sparse coefficients (features) and the elements of a dictionary (filters). The filters represent universal signals that can model different images, whereas the coefficients are intrinsic to one particular image. Estimating the coefficients and the filters from a set of observed signals is similar to a blind deconvolution problem where we aim to simultaneously represent a signal via the convolution of two unknown signals. Classical CDL provides data-dependent filters that, in the seismic data processing case, might not have a solid resemblance to typical waveforms that one observes in seismic records. This limits the dictionary’s representation and discriminability, thus suffering from suboptimal denoising or reconstruction results. To address this challenge, we propose a new CDL algorithm. The proposed approach introduces a parametric constraint to enforce simplicity on the filters, guiding the learning process toward a more efficient and structured representation of the data. Specifically, we restrict each filter to include one single waveform parametrizable via a second-order traveltime curve and a seismic wavelet. The learned dictionary comprises linear and parabolic events that adapt adequately to observed seismic waveforms and resemble local Radon transform basis functions. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) is adopted to solve the proposed parametric convolutional learning problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior reconstruction results compared to the existing convolutional and patch-based dictionary learning methods.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48302fa9f8f18cb5c3fba768006ddcf2ffb0a9b6,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48302fa9f8f18cb5c3fba768006ddcf2ffb0a9b6,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science, Computer Science",6,1cf7bde1e6320e7c14e42dcac2701929,10.1109/TGRS.2023.3303449,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Researchers have proposed various fairness notions like envy-freeness (EF), and its relaxations, proportionality and max-min share (MMS). There is vast literature on the existential and computational aspects of such notions. While computing fair allocations, any algorithm assumes agents’ truthful reporting of their valuations towards the resources. Whereas in real-world web-based applications for fair division, the agents involved are strategic and may manipulate for individual utility gain. In this paper, we study strategy-proof mechanisms without monetary transfer, which satisfies the various fairness criteria. We know that for additive valuations, designing truthful mechanisms for EF, MMS and proportionality is impossible. Here we show that there cannot be a truthful mechanism for EFX and the existing algorithms for EF1 are manipulable. We then study the particular case of single-minded agents. For this case, we provide a Serial Dictatorship Mechanism that is strategy-proof and satisfies all the fairness criteria except EF.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e9b231182d1e8c5b531ebadb8ea357792d70d33,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07255,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e9b231182d1e8c5b531ebadb8ea357792d70d33,WI/IAT,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",5,11fdea15082ccc93857134e7ca016890,10.1145/3486622.3493955,2112.07255,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

The study measured corporate governance attributes with board size, board independence, board gender diversity, board financial expertise and sustainability reporting was measured by sustainability disclosures metrics in line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The study adopted correlation research design relying on secondary data obtained from annual reports of the population, which comprised of 116 non-financial firms listed on Nigeria Exchange Group (NGX) as at 31st December 2020 with a sample size of 51 firms, covering the period of 2011 – 2020. The study employed multiple regression panel model to analyze the data with the aid of E-view 10 statistical tool. According to the results of random effect regression, board size and board members’ financial expertise have positive and significant effect on sustainability reporting.

One of the major challenges of vaccine distribution is achieving fair and equitable allocation across the countries of the world, regardless of their economic wealth. The self-interested behaviour of high-income countries and the underutilisation of vaccines allocated to underprepared countries are some of the failures reported during COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. These shortcomings have motivated the need for a central market mechanism that takes into account the countries’ vulnerability to COVID-19 and their readiness to distribute and administer their allocated vaccines. In this paper, we leverage game theory to study the problem of equitable global vaccine distribution and propose a fair market mechanism that aligns self-interested behaviour with optimal global objectives. First, we model the interaction between a central vaccine provider (e.g. COVAX) and a country reporting its demand as a two-player game, and discuss the Nash and mixed Nash equilibria of that game. Then, we propose a repeated auction mechanism with an artificial payment system for allocating vaccines among participating countries, where each auction round is based on a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. The proposed allocation mechanism aims at minimising deaths and incentivises the self-interested countries to report their demand truthfully. Compared with real-world COVAX allocation decisions, our results show that the proposed auction mechanism achieves more efficient outcomes that maximise the number of averted deaths. Pragmatic considerations are investigated and policy recommendations are discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79adb74cb5c6609585bd2b3fc09f46ef57899cbc,https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0001711&type=printable,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79adb74cb5c6609585bd2b3fc09f46ef57899cbc,PLOS Global Public Health,"Medicine, Economics, Medicine",5,8aa07f27f9f9bb980a41f4bf11c7f092,10.1371/journal.pgph.0001711,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Tao",2024,"Audit committees are appointed by the board of directors of corporations to oversee the financial reporting process, monitor financial control processes, hire and assess independent auditors, and communicate findings with management and auditors. We propose two new measures of audit oversight quality. The first measure is purely subjective, in that it scores audit committees on a scale based on their ability to fulfill one or more of their responsibilities, as mentioned in annual reports, Form 10-K and DEF 13A. The second measure concerns audit committee activity, as it measures the number of times the term ‘audit committee’ is mentioned in these documents. Both measures were obtained for U.S. pharmaceutical companies and energy companies from 2010 to 2022. The audit oversight quality measures were regressed in regard to profitability (measured by return on assets and return on equity), debt capacity (measured by equity multiplier), and firm value (measured by Tobin’s q and economic value added). Audit oversight quality, using both measures, reduces the return on equity. Audit oversight quality, using both measures, had a disciplining effect on debt. Increases in the oversight of increasing debt discourage the propensity to increase borrowing using collateral (debt capacity), and reduce investor returns through investment in debt-financed projects (return on equity). Audit oversight quality, using both measures, exhibited a size effect on the firm’s value, in that an increase in the firm size with high audit oversight quality increases the firm’s value. However, it is possible that only the first measure of audit oversight quality significantly increased the firm’s value, as only the first measure exhibited robustness to the endogeneity effect of size.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7a17cfc8af308006df29cca87dd89d3ee3789dc,https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/17/4/151/pdf?version=1712732124,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7a17cfc8af308006df29cca87dd89d3ee3789dc,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,"Business, Economics",5,bf997c17d84ae5c72406231203f04abc,10.3390/jrfm17040151,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Business'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Rao, Sudeepthi Govathoti",2024,"Electric two-wheelers (ETWs) have emerged as a dominant choice over traditional counterparts in global consumer markets, prompting a shift in consumer behaviour. While existing research has delved into the adoption of ETWs, there remains a notable gap in understanding the intricate factors driving consumer adoption, particularly their inclination toward innovation. This study investigates the landscape of ETWs in India, focusing on facilitating conditions, pricing dynamics, personal innovativeness, and behavioral intentions. Utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework, 220 Indian ETW users were surveyed to elucidate the interplay between facilitating conditions, price, and behavioral intentions, mediated by personal innovativeness. The findings underscore the significant impact of facilitating conditions and price on behavioral intentions, with personal innovativeness serving as a pivotal mediator in this relationship. Moreover, this study underscores the importance for ETW businesses to prioritize user-friendly designs, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for consumers. Furthermore, targeting highly innovative consumers emerges as a strategic imperative for businesses in devising effective marketing strategies. By shedding light on facilitating conditions, price dynamics, personal innovation, and behavioral intentions, this study contributes valuable insights to the existing literature. In terms of environmental sustainability, the scalability of electric twowheelers contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating air pollution in urban areas. As more individuals switch from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric two-wheelers, the collective impact on reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality becomes increasingly significant, especially in densely populated regions where transportation-related pollution is a major concern.

aa242830503bb7158b63656fa56fd91e82c98b8b,Superposition of Induced Polarization signals measured on pyrite-sand mixtures,"T. Martin, A. Weller",2023,"
 Induced polarization (IP) is a common method in ore exploration. IP spectra measured over a wide frequency range can be used to characterize material properties of ores, slags and other residual material from mines and processing facilities. Previous studies have shown that IP parameters are sensitive to type, content or grain size of electronically conductive or semi-conductive minerals. Up to now, a variety of experiments has been performed on sand mixtures with fractions of ore minerals. Most experiments consider only a single fraction with a fixed grain size. We continue a series of experiments that have been done with sand-pyrite mixtures. The presented study compares IP spectra recorded for samples either with a single grain radius fraction (E-samples) or with two different grain radii fractions (Z-samples). The spectra are fitted to Pelton models. A Debye decomposition that provides a relaxation time distribution (RTD) is applied to the complex conductivity spectra. The RTD indicates separated maxima only if the ratio of mean grain radii is larger than a factor five. The resolution of the phase spectra and the spectra of imaginary part of conductivity is lower. Even though the volumetric pyrite content is equal in each fraction, the phase spectra and RTD of the Z-samples indicate much higher signals for the pyrite fraction with smaller grain radius. The same observation is made for the chargeability that shows larger values for decreasing grain radii. This finding contradicts existing theories that consider the chargeability as a suitable proxy of the volumetric content of ore minerals. We explain the observed effect by an interaction between neighboring pyrite particles. The conductivity of the mixtures of the E-samples increases with decreasing grain radius of the pyrite fraction. This effect is attributed to dissolution effects on the surface of the pyrite particles during the sample preparation. We find that the additive superposition of the phase spectra of two E-samples is in good agreement with the measured phase spectra of the Z-samples (measured superposition) containing the two corresponding pyrite fractions. The agreement is slightly worse for the spectra of imaginary part of conductivity, where the measured superposition overestimates the mathematical superposition. The experimental results of our study motivate a further improvement of existing mechanistic models.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa242830503bb7158b63656fa56fd91e82c98b8b,https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-pdf/234/1/699/49605275/ggad091.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa242830503bb7158b63656fa56fd91e82c98b8b,Geophysical Journal International,"Geology, Engineering",5,d7908f0d9f14268cfcbca314d77015e1,10.1093/gji/ggad091,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Geology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Odisho, Peter R. Carroll, Bin Yu",2024,"Automated mechanistic interpretation research has attracted great interest due to its potential to scale explanations of neural network internals to large models. Existing automated circuit discovery work relies on activation patching or its approximations to identify subgraphs in models for specific tasks (circuits). They often suffer from slow runtime, approximation errors, and specific requirements of metrics, such as non-zero gradients. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T) to build interpretable circuits in large language models. CD-T can produce circuits of arbitrary level of abstraction, and is the first able to produce circuits as fine-grained as attention heads at specific sequence positions efficiently. CD-T consists of a set of mathematical equations to isolate contribution of model features. Through recursively computing contribution of all nodes in a computational graph of a model using CD-T followed by pruning, we are able to reduce circuit discovery runtime from hours to seconds compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On three standard circuit evaluation datasets (indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion), we demonstrate that CD-T outperforms ACDC and EAP by better recovering the manual circuits with an average of 97% ROC AUC under low runtimes. In addition, we provide evidence that faithfulness of CD-T circuits is not due to random chance by showing our circuits are 80% more faithful than random circuits of up to 60% of the original model size. Finally, we show CD-T circuits are able to perfectly replicate original models' behavior (faithfulness $ = 1$) using fewer nodes than the baselines for all tasks. Our results underscore the great promise of CD-T for efficient automated mechanistic interpretability, paving the way for new insights into the workings of large language models.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5684ccbe70d46346c72ea3427285c480d972bc9d,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00886.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5684ccbe70d46346c72ea3427285c480d972bc9d,International Conference on Learning Representations,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Engineering",5,4fbbaab6d40c61ee750b25df4daee9e5,,2407.00886,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

The study was performed with methods for analysis of complex system dynamics, including fuzzy recurrence plots, fuzzy joint recurrence plots, fuzzy weighted recurrence networks, and tensor decomposition of the recurrence dynamics. Both the use of two complex network properties known as the average clustering coefficient and characteristic path length and the tensor decomposition of the fuzzy weighted recurrence plots of the depression time series suggest a critical transition as an early warning signal in the reduction of anti-depressant medication applied to a single participant. Fuzzy recurrence plots, fuzzy recurrence networks, and tensor decomposition of mental-state dynamics are useful mathematical tools for constructing patient-specific models of the dynamics of depression and detecting development of new depressive episodes over the effect of drug-dosage alteration.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14e101ae219ff639c2683c6000a307b37930e093,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14e101ae219ff639c2683c6000a307b37930e093,Australasian Computer Science Week,"Mathematics, Computer Science, Psychology, Medicine, Computer Science",5,50c668abfd479f1ce3d0548a49c1c74c,10.1145/3373017.3373057,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

The features can be interpreted as sub‐structures of the data. The number of sub‐structures in the feature matrix is also called the rank. This parameter controls the model complexity and is the only tuning parameter for the NMF model. An appropriate rank will extract the key latent features while minimizing the noise from the original data. However due to the large amount of optimization error always present in the NMF computation, the rank selection has been a difficult problem. We develop a novel rank selection method based on hypothesis testing, using a deconvolved bootstrap distribution to assess the significance level accurately. Through simulations, we compare our method with a rank selection method based on hypothesis testing using bootstrap distribution without deconvolution and a method based on cross‐validation; we demonstrate that our method is not only accurate at estimating the true ranks for NMF, especially when the features are hard to distinguish, but also efficient at computation.

In recent years, the sparse dictionary representation method k-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) based on K-means, which can adaptively change the basis function according to the data, has become a hotspot in the field of image denoising and data reconstruction. Nevertheless, the SVD is a time-consuming calculation, especially unacceptable in multidimensional problems; we introduce a dictionary learning method based on the sequential generalized K-means (SGK), where the dictionary atoms are updated by the arithmetic average of several training signals instead of a great deal of SVD calculation in K-SVD. We establish a 3-D road simulation model and conduct finite-difference time-domain forward numerical simulation to acquire 3-D GPR data. Through three sets of experiments on 3-D numerical examples and 3-D field data, the results show that both dictionary learning algorithms can successfully remove random noise from GPR data even at a lower input signal-to-noise ratio. The clutter interference in the random medium forward data can be effectively eliminated simultaneously, and both denoising methods exhibit promising applications in 3-D field data. However, the SGK method solves the serious problem of computational efficiency to a certain extent. The computational acceleration ratio of SGK remains consistently above 7.5× that of the K-SVD algorithm in multigroup experiments, with only a marginal decline in denoising performance.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20dc7b8e4ad542ace562d9d216908e5bbd47ebf6,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/4609443/4609444/10438015.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20dc7b8e4ad542ace562d9d216908e5bbd47ebf6,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,"Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Science",5,612ce64e51ac7002d67c78997e9c5813,10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3366397,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Considering that only new measurements are necessary for updating the model parameters, the proposed method elevates engineering applicability. First, in order to quantitatively analyze the discrepancy between the new and previous modes, the common features are extracted by TMPDL, upon which new modes can be modeled using domain transfer, saving storage resources and ensuring scalability. Then, the corresponding optimization process is fully discussed, which incorporates feature selection and extraction to select specific features for updating while enhancing the interpretability of the model. Concurrently, consistency and independence constraints are imposed on dictionary learning (DL), which makes the features extracted by the proposed method more discriminative. Finally, the monitoring model is developed by feature reconstruction error (FRE), which can derive monitoring results prior to mode identification.

Grizzle, Max Denis, Marzieh Savadkoohi, Esther Ososanya",2023,"Since the outbreak of coronavirus also known as COVID-19, there have been several studies on the disease. This study investigates patients’ electrocardiography (ECG) properties for an accurate prediction of this infectious disease. Our findings will be useful to medical practitioners in the accurate prognosis of COVID-19. We analyzed ECG datasets of patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and Normal Persons who had tested negative. Using the analyzed dataset, we designed, developed, and evaluated twelve machine-learning models to predict COVID-19 with different combinations of learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques. Time, frequency, and time-frequency domain features were extracted using Time Series Feature Extraction Library (TSFEL). A combination of domains’ features comprising of Time, Frequency, and Time-Frequency attributes for prediction were also investigated. We deployed a T-test to determine the necessary and enough features for our predictive modeling. The ECG morphological feature analysis was based on peak-to-peak detection, onset, and offset of the QRS complex. K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithms were deployed to classify the ECG signals for the prediction of COVID-19. For each feature domain, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) visualization tool was used to ‘open’ the black box for explainability and interpretability of feature importance and weights. SHAP’s result suggests that extracted feature weight distribution in different algorithms shows consistency in feature importance per domain. However, the weight and the proportion are not the same. Performance evaluation of our classifiers was based on accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F1 score. Our experimental results show that the classification encompassing all domain features (Temporal, Spectral, and wavelet) with Random Forest has a slight edge over other models. The proposed model has accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F1 score of 97.09%, 98%, 97%, and 97%, respectively.

We develop an adaptive parameters estimation approach for tunable $Q$ -factor wavelet transform (TQWT), which provides accurate periodic and nonstationary subband information from microseismic data for online dictionary learning (ODL). A sliding time window is employed to divide the obtained subbands into a series of patches of equal length, which are then assembled into a matrix and fed into the ODL. The subband kurtosis information is weighted to the constraint function of the ODL, further enhancing the sparse coding ability for each subband. Shortening the oscillation duration, an improved ODL is developed with a faster convergence speed in calculating sparse coefficients. Our results confirm that the WWODL can suppress high-frequency, low-frequency, and shared-bandwidth noises and has a minimal impact on the first arrival.

However, there are still some shortcomings when it is directly applied to intelligent gear-fault diagnosis, such as low classification accuracy, a time-consuming dictionary learning process and unsatisfactory anti-interference capabilities, especially for vibration signals with heavy noise. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a low-dimensional multi-scale FDDL (LM-FDDL) model, which extracts the fault-sensitive and multi-scale information from wavelet packet transform coefficients, and constructs a low-dimensional sample set via L-kurtosis for dictionary learning. This improves the anti-interference capability of the model and greatly reduces the computational cost. The dictionary learned from the low-dimensional sample set has excellent discriminant performance and interpretability, which are verified by the visualization of reconstructed signals. Experimental results for a spur-gear fault dataset and a bevel-gear fault dataset demonstrate the superiority of LM-FDDL over other related methods in terms of fault classification accuracy and computational cost. An added-noise comparison experiment verifies that the dimension -reducing strategy of LM-FDDL has strong robustness to noise and outliers, and thus ensures that the main fault features can be extracted from vibration signals with heavy noise interference.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8994a845e6537499c2ce16a3b50a053fa5109c1f,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8994a845e6537499c2ce16a3b50a053fa5109c1f,Measurement science and technology,"Computer Science, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science",5,a3dd7f26bebd0cc90abe2140492f2275,10.1088/1361-6501/abf619,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

As the seismic wave propagates, the filtering effect of the Earth and its various layers will result in energy attenuation and velocity dispersion; these phenomena weaken the seismic time series amplitudes and distort the seismic phase data. In traditional processing methods, noise removal precedes the data compensation process, which attempts to retrieve information that was originally lost due to signal attenuation. If denoising is performed, weak seismic signals are often removed, resulting in the loss of useful signal data that cannot be recovered. Here, we propose a sparse regularization strategy based on dictionary learning. This inversion method performs the denoising and data compensation tasks in parallel.

The proposed method is implemented considering a 32-channel uniform polyphase discrete Fourier transform filter bank, for which the overall algorithm processing delay is 8 ms in accordance with the hearing device requirements. The proposed speech enhancement technique, which exploits the concepts of both non-negative sparse coding (NNSC) and spectral statistical filtering, provides an online unified framework to overcome the problem of residual noise in spectral statistical filters under noisy environments. First, the spectral gain attenuator of the statistical Wiener filter is obtained using the a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimated through a decision-directed approach. Next, the spectrum estimated using the Wiener spectral gain attenuator is decomposed by applying the NNSC technique to the target speech and residual noise components.

However, due to the high computational cost of the optimization algorithms required to compute the sparse feature, the applicability of SC to real-time object recognition tasks is limited. Many deep neural networks have been constructed to low fast estimate the sparse feature with the help of a large number of training samples, which is not suitable for small-scale datasets. Therefore, this work presents a simple and efficient fast approximation method for SC, in which a special single-hidden-layer neural network (SLNNs) is constructed to perform the approximation task, and the optimal sparse features of training samples exactly computed by sparse coding algorithm are used as ground truth to train the SLNNs. After training, the proposed SLNNs can quickly estimate sparse features for testing samples. Ten benchmark data sets taken from UCI databases and two face image datasets are used for experiment, and the low root mean square error (RMSE) results between the approximated sparse features and the optimal ones have verified the approximation performance of this proposed method. Furthermore, the recognition results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the computational time of testing process while maintaining the recognition performance, and outperforms several state-of-the-art fast approximation sparse coding methods, as well as the exact sparse coding algorithms.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3de5ab85c150e70edfe10368c00a1c7f64a2988b,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/4/1442/pdf?version=1614073547,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3de5ab85c150e70edfe10368c00a1c7f64a2988b,Italian National Conference on Sensors,"Computer Science, Medicine, Computer Science",5,8a695ca25479b41ad61f200577482dca,10.3390/s21041442,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:59.362493+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:59.362493+00:00

Wolfer",2022,"Translational research in behavioral neuroscience seeks causes and remedies for human mental health problems in animals, following leads imposed by clinical research in psychiatry. This endeavor faces several problems because scientists must read and interpret animal movements to represent human perceptions, mood, and memory processes. Yet, it is still not known how mammalian brains bundle all these processes into a highly compressed motor output in the brain stem and spinal cord, but without that knowledge, translational research remains aimless. Based on some four decades of experience in the field, the article identifies sources of interpretation problems and illustrates typical translational pitfalls. (1) The sensory world of mice is different. Smell, hearing, and tactile whisker sensations dominate in rodents, while visual input is comparatively small. In humans, the relations are reversed. (2) Mouse and human brains are equated inappropriately: the association cortex makes up a large portion of the human neocortex, while it is relatively small in rodents. The predominant associative cortex in rodents is the hippocampus itself, orchestrating chiefly inputs from secondary sensorimotor areas and generating species-typical motor patterns that are not easily reconciled with putative human hippocampal functions. (3) Translational interpretation of studies of memory or emotionality often neglects the ecology of mice, an extremely small species surviving by freezing or flight reactions that do not need much cognitive processing. (4) Further misinterpretations arise from confounding neuronal properties with system properties, and from rigid mechanistic thinking unaware that many experimentally induced changes in the brain do partially reflect unpredictable compensatory plasticity. (5) Based on observing hippocampal lesion effects in mice indoors and outdoors, the article offers a simplistic general model of hippocampal functions in relation to hypothalamic input and output, placing hypothalamus and the supraspinal motor system at the top of a cerebral hierarchy. (6) Many translational problems could be avoided by inclusion of simple species-typical behaviors as end-points comparable to human cognitive or executive processing, and to rely more on artificial intelligence for recognizing patterns not classifiable by traditional psychological concepts.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e1111e66fffbf2c6b0daf1c3104fd9853557028,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2022.958067/pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e1111e66fffbf2c6b0daf1c3104fd9853557028,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,"Medicine, Psychology",5,3525e3276495ae99175efa4ff0e298f5,10.3389/fnbeh.2022.958067,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Maté, Juan Trujillo",2024,"Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by being trained on broad amounts of data in a self-supervised manner, have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks. Indeed, their generative abilities have aroused interest on the application of LLMs across a wide range of contexts. However, neural networks in general, and LLMs in particular, are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where an imperceptible change to the input can mislead the output of the model. This is a serious concern that impedes the use of LLMs on high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, where a wrong prediction can imply serious consequences. Even though there are many efforts on making LLMs more robust to adversarial attacks, there are almost no works that study how and where these vulnerabilities that make LLMs prone to adversarial attacks happen. Motivated by these facts, we explore how to localize and understand vulnerabilities, and propose a method, based on Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, to guide this process. Specifically, this method enables us to detect vulnerabilities related to a concrete task by (i) obtaining the subset of the model that is responsible for that task, (ii) generating adversarial samples for that task, and (iii) using MI techniques together with the previous samples to discover and understand the possible vulnerabilities.

This pattern, typical of training tasks in machine learning, allows customers to partially predict future job requirements. We develop a model of cloud computing platforms that receive statements of work (SoWs) in an online fashion. The SoWs describe future jobs whose arrival times and durations are probabilistic, and whose utility to the submitting agents declines with completion time. The arrival and duration distributions, as well as the utility functions, are considered private customer information and are reported by strategic agents to a scheduler that is optimizing for social welfare. We design pricing, scheduling, and eviction mechanisms that incentivize truthful reporting of SoWs. An important challenge is maintaining incentives despite the possibility of the platform becoming saturated.

Suppose the players can create new identities to report to the auctioneer at some cost $c$. The usual mechanism design paradigm is equivalent to implicitly assuming that $c$ is infinity for all players, while the usual Sybil attacks literature is that it is zero or finite for one player (the attacker) and infinity for everyone else (the 'honest' players). The false-name proof literature largely assumes the cost to be 0. We consider a model with variable costs that unifies these disparate streams. A paradigmatic normal form game can be extended into a Sybil game by having the action space by the product of the feasible set of identities to create action where each player chooses how many players to present as in the game and their actions in the original normal form game. A mechanism is (dominant) false-name proof if it is (dominant) incentive-compatible for all the players to self-report as at most one identity. We study mechanisms proposed in the literature motivated by settings where anonymity and self-identification are the norms, and show conditions under which they are not Sybil-proof. We characterize a class of dominant Sybil-proof mechanisms for reward sharing and show that they achieve the efficiency upper bound.

Absenteeism and other problems that arise in Uganda’s public education system are often attributed to a lack of public oversight and parental involvement. In an effort to develop a scalable method of encouraging community engagement on this issue, the present study assesses the extent to which entertainment-education videos increase willingness among Ugandans to take action against absenteeism. Working in collaboration with Ugandan screenwriters and local actors, we developed video dramatisations that depicted the problem of absenteeism and how parents mobilised to address it. We assess the persuasive effects of these dramatisations both under lab-like conditions, to gauge immediate effects, and in the field, to gauge effects two months and eight months after a placebo-controlled media campaign attended by over 10,000 Ugandans in 112 villages. Although the persuasive effects are weaker in the field than the lab setting, the former remain substantial even after eight months.

Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for supervised fine-tuning.

Bauermeister, Ufuoma Oyiborhoro, Subhash Aryal, Terri Lipman, Andy S. L. Tan, Karen Glanz, Antonia Villarruel, Stephen Bonett",2024,"Background Over half of the youth population in the United States, aged 6 months to 17 years, have not received the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Given parents’ central role in vaccinating their children, we examined associations between parents’ trust of the federal oversight of COVID-19 vaccine safety and their willingness to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Methods This cross-sectional study included 975 parents of minor children residing in Philadelphia who completed the online survey between September 2021 and February 2022. Trust was measured using a four-point Likert scale ranging from ‘do not trust’ to ‘fully trust’ for two variables: (1) trust in federal oversight of COVID-19 vaccine safety for children and (2) trust in federal oversight of COVID-19 vaccine safety for the general public. A multiple logistic regression evaluated associations between trust and parents’ willingness to vaccinate their children, which was measured on a five-point Likert scale ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree.’ The analysis was adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender, education, insurance, and parents’ vaccination status. Results Analyses included 975 parents whose children had not previously been vaccinated against COVID-19 (mean age 36.79, standard deviation 6.4; 42.1% racial/ethnic minorities; 93.2% heterosexual; and 73.7% with a college degree). Greater trust regarding federal oversight of COVID-19 vaccine safety for children [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13–2.04] and for the public (aOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.17–2.14) were each associated with increased willingness to have their child vaccinated against COVID-19. Unvaccinated parents had decreased willingness compared to parents who had received at least one dose of the vaccine (aOR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.04–0.41). College-graduate parents exhibited increased willingness compared to those without a college degree (aOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.52–2.81). Non-heterosexual parents showed increased willingness compared to heterosexual parents (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.20–4.76). Conclusions Trust in federal COVID-19 vaccine oversight was associated with parental willingness to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 among parents whose children have not yet been vaccinated. Identifying and addressing causes of mistrust are crucial next steps to promote child vaccination. Intervention efforts to address trust gaps should remain a public health priority.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b6c37d81e2710b21f12a88b7715b8f79a8ff15b3,https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12889-024-18342-y,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b6c37d81e2710b21f12a88b7715b8f79a8ff15b3,BMC Public Health,"Medicine, Medicine",4,0d1a516d14a69a6b3603b491ecb91aba,10.1186/s12889-024-18342-y,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Traditional DevOps, characterized by continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), often struggles with scalability, error-prone processes, and the need for constant human oversight. AI-driven DevOps introduces intelligent automation, enabling predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and self-healing infrastructure. By leveraging AI/ML, organizations can predict deployment outcomes, identify potential issues in real time, and automatically rectify them, reducing downtime and enhancing overall system performance. This paper explores the current state of DevOps, highlighting its limitations and the transformative potential of AI/ML integration. We discuss key AI/ML use cases in DevOps, such as automated code quality analysis, predictive analytics for deployment, and self-healing systems. Additionally, we examine the tools and technologies that facilitate AI-driven DevOps, including ML frameworks like TensorFlow and observability platforms like Datadog. Despite its potential, AI-driven DevOps faces challenges, including data quality, integration complexity, and ethical considerations. The paper also looks into the future of AI in DevOps, envisioning a fully autonomous deployment and maintenance ecosystem. By addressing current challenges and embracing AI/ML technologies, organizations can significantly improve their DevOps processes, leading to faster, more reliable software delivery.

To enhance the explainability of models of end-to-end object DEtection with TRansformer (DETR), we introduce a disentanglement method that constrains the feature learning process, following a divide-and-conquer decoupling paradigm, similar to how people understand complex real-world problems. We first demonstrate the entangled property of the features between the extractor and detector and find that the regression function is a key factor contributing to the deterioration of disentangled feature activation. These highly entangled features always activate the local characteristics, making it difficult to cover the semantic information of an object, which also reduces the interpretability of single-backbone object detection models. Thus, an Explainability Enhanced object detection Transformer with feature Disentanglement (DETD) model is proposed, in which the Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVD) is used to produce feature bases and the Batch averaged Feature Spectral Penalization (BFSP) loss is introduced to constrain the disentanglement of the feature and balance the semantic activation. The proposed method is applied across three prominent backbones, two DETR variants, and a CNN based model. By combining two optimization techniques, extensive experiments on two datasets consistently demonstrate that the DETD model outperforms the counterpart in terms of object detection performance and feature disentanglement.

The Tensor Euler deconvolution applies additional constraints to the Euler solution using all gravity vectors and the full gravity gradient tensor. These algorithms use a series of different-sized moving windows to yield many solutions that can be employed to estimate the source location from the entire survey area. However, traditional discrimination techniques ignore the interrelation among the Euler solutions, so they cannot be employed to separate adjacent targets. To overcome this difficulty, we introduced multivariate Kernel Density Derivative Estimation (KDDE) as an extension of Kernel Density Estimation, which is a mathematical process to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. The multivariate KDDE was tested on a single cube model, a single cylinder model, and three composite models consisting of two cubes with various separations using gridded data. The probability value calculated by the multivariate KDDE was used to discriminate spurious solutions from the Euler solution dataset and isolate adjacent geological sources. The method was then applied to airborne gravity data from British Columbia, Canada.

Liu, Qiu‐lin Qu",2024,"Being a direct computational aeroacoustics method, Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has great potential and broad application perspective in the field of numerical simulation of aerodynamic noise due to its low dispersion and low dissipation. A series of numerical algorithms and the related improvements based on the standard LBM method are proposed and developed in this paper to adapt to the airfoil noise calculation with complex grid at middle‐high Reynolds number. First, a new mathematical‐boundary‐recognition algorithm based on Green's formula is proposed to deal with complex curved geometric models, which is validated by three‐element airfoil 30P30N benchmark. Then, in order to reduce grid redundancy and improve computing efficiency, the grid refinement technique of domain decomposition model (DDM) is adopted and also improved, which is verified by calculating the flow and sound fields around 2D and 3D cylinders at Reynolds number equal to 90,000. Finally, three different LES turbulence models are combined with the standard MRT‐LBM method, where different finite difference schemes are used to solve Reynolds stress tensor which is different from the traditional one. Through the direct acoustic numerical simulation of NACA0012 airfoil at Reynolds number equal to 200,000, the effects of Smagorinsky models and Wall‐adapting local eddy‐viscosity (WALE) model on aerodynamic noise prediction are compared and analyzed.

Kishk",2024,"Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening disease affecting at least 64 million people worldwide. Hence, it places great stresses on patients and healthcare systems. Accordingly, providing a computerized model for HF prediction will help in enhancing diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of HF. In this paper, we introduce a new guided attentive HF prediction approach. In this method, a sparse-guided feature ranking method is proposed. Firstly, a Gauss–Seidel strategy is applied to the preprocessed feature pool for low-rank approximation procedure with a trace-norm regularization. The resultant sparse attributes, after a Spearman ranking elimination, are employed to guide the original feature pool through linear translation-variant model. Then, a fast Newton-based method is employed for a non-negative matrix factorization for the guided feature pool. The resultant bases of the factorization process are finally utilized in the adopted deep attentive predictive model. For the final prediction stage, instead of the commonly used machine learning approaches, we introduce an attentive-based classifier. It employs sequential attention to choose the most proper salient features for efficient interpretability and learning process. For the evaluation of the proposed HF prediction model, three different datasets are employed, i.e., UCI, Faisalabad, and Framingham datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed approach outperforms their performance on all datasets with even small feature sizes.

Drakopoulos, Phivos Mylonas",2022,"Matrix factorization is paramount in large scale graph mining as well as a versatile paradigm for dimensionality reduction. In particular, factoring a graph adjacency matrix may well reveal, depending on the specific f actor properties, higher order structure. The latter describes global graph properties better compared to first order connectivity patterns such as vertex degrees. The Boolean semiring factorization of an adjacency matrix yields a product of two smaller and sparser matrices where the former contains disjoint fundamental vertex subsets and the latter combinations thereof. Therefore, the first factor represents community structure and the second has the cross connections between them. In this way graph partitioning and dimensionality reduction are simultaneously achieved. Because of the nature of the Boolean semiring, most common linear algebraic solvers cannot be applied. Moreover, the exact factorization is NP hard. To address these limitations, a genetic algorithm has been developed with evolutionary operations tailored to heuristically compute said factorization which offers interpretability and a high parallelism potential. Besides graph mining the major applications of the Boolean semiring factorization include role mining in enterprise database and operating system realms, curriculum design, and graph flows under inflexible uniqueness constraints.

However, current methods struggle to find clear interpretations of neural network activations because a decomposition of activations into computational features is missing. Individual neurons or model components do not cleanly correspond to distinct features or functions. We present a novel interpretability method that aims to overcome this limitation by transforming the activations of the network into a new basis - the Local Interaction Basis (LIB). LIB aims to identify computational features by removing irrelevant activations and interactions. Our method drops irrelevant activation directions and aligns the basis with the singular vectors of the Jacobian matrix between adjacent layers. It also scales features based on their importance for downstream computation, producing an interaction graph that shows all computationally-relevant features and interactions in a model. We evaluate the effectiveness of LIB on modular addition and CIFAR-10 models, finding that it identifies more computationally-relevant features that interact more sparsely, compared to principal component analysis. However, LIB does not yield substantial improvements in interpretability or interaction sparsity when applied to language models. We conclude that LIB is a promising theory-driven approach for analyzing neural networks, but in its current form is not applicable to large language models.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ee4b3249380d73a27acd2244bb01a97c229d9bc,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10928.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ee4b3249380d73a27acd2244bb01a97c229d9bc,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science",4,6427f5d34db67ac5a4ac0b00dd964064,10.48550/arXiv.2405.10928,2405.10928,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

Previous studies have reported numerous signatures, using matrix factorization methods for mutation catalogs. Different mutation signatures are active in different tumor types; hence, signature activity varies greatly among tumor types and becomes sparse. Because of this, many previous methods require dividing mutation catalogs for each tumor type. Here, we propose parallelized latent Dirichlet allocation (PLDA), a novel Bayesian model to simultaneously predict mutation signatures with all mutation catalogs. PLDA is an extended model of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is one of the methods used for signature prediction. It has parallelized hyperparameters of Dirichlet distributions for LDA, and they represent the sparsity of signature activities for each tumor type, thus facilitating simultaneous analyses. First, we conducted a simulation experiment to compare PLDA with previous methods (including SigProfiler and SignatureAnalyzer) using artificial data and confirmed that PLDA could predict signature structures as accurately as previous methods without searching for the optimal hyperparameters. Next, we applied PLDA to PCAWG (Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes) mutation catalogs and obtained a signature set different from the one predicted by SigProfiler. Further, we have shown that the mutation spectrum represented by the predicted signature with PLDA provides a novel interpretability through post-analyses.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87529c90feaa5df7beb0ba27ebe8f3546da03d47,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/11/10/1127/pdf?version=1601021557,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87529c90feaa5df7beb0ba27ebe8f3546da03d47,Genes,"Medicine, Computer Science, Computer Science, Medicine, Biology",4,33ffdb3b61aea01422e7ac07af048ad8,10.3390/genes11101127,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

The evaluation focuses on coherence, interpretability, generalization, computational efficiency, and scalability. The results indicate that NMF achieves the highest coherence score (0.7987), demonstrating its effectiveness in extracting well-defined topics from structured narratives. pLSA performs competitively (coherence: 0.7634) but lacks the scalability of NMF. LDA and BERTopic, while effective in generalization (perplexity: −6.471 and −4.638, respectively), struggle with coherence due to their probabilistic nature and reliance on contextual embeddings.

To address this problem, we combined 2D variational modal decomposition and dictionary learning. We proposed a low-dose CT (LDCT) image denoising algorithm based on an improved K-SVD algorithm with image decomposition. The dictionary obtained by K-SVD training lacks consideration of image structure information. To address this problem, we employ the two-dimensional variational mode decomposition (2D-VMD) method to decompose the image into distinct modal components. Through the adaptive learning of dictionaries based on the characteristics of each modal component, independent denoising processing is applied to each component, avoiding the loss of structural and detailed information in the image. In addition, we introduce the regularized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (ROMP) and dictionary atom optimization method to improve the sparse representation ability of the dictionary and reduce the impact of noise atoms on denoising performance.

Santos, Francisco Madeiro, Juliano B. Lima",2024,"Signal processing is a very useful field of study in the interpretation of signals in many everyday applications. In the case of applications with time-varying signals, one possibility is to consider them as graphs, so graph theory arises, which extends classical methods to the non-Euclidean domain. In addition, machine learning techniques have been widely used in pattern recognition activities in a wide variety of tasks, including health sciences. The objective of this work is to identify and analyze the papers in the literature that address the use of machine learning applied to graph signal processing in health sciences. A search was performed in four databases (Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM, and MDPI), using search strings to identify papers that are in the scope of this review. Finally, 45 papers were included in the analysis, the first being published in 2015, which indicates an emerging area. Among the gaps found, we can mention the need for better clinical interpretability of the results obtained in the papers, that is not to restrict the results or conclusions simply to performance metrics. In addition, a possible research direction is the use of new transforms.

Deep learning methods offered unprecedented performance in medical signal processing but at a cost: they were compute intensive and lacked interpretability. We propose sparse mixture of learned kernels (SMoLK), an interpretable architecture for medical time series processing. SMoLK learns a set of lightweight flexible kernels that form a single-layer sparse neural network, providing not only interpretability but also efficiency, robustness and generalization to unseen data distributions. We introduce parameter reduction techniques to reduce the size of SMoLK networks and maintain performance. We test SMoLK on two important tasks common to many consumer wearables: photoplethysmography artefact detection and atrial fibrillation detection from single-lead electrocardiograms. We find that SMoLK matches the performance of models orders of magnitude larger.

The progression of DR appears to prominently feature the loss of retinal cells, encompassing neural retinal cells, pericytes, and endothelial cells. Therefore, mitigating the apoptosis of retinal cells in DR could potentially enhance the therapeutic approach for managing the condition by suppressing retinal vascular leakage. Recent advancements have highlighted the crucial regulatory roles played by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in diverse biological processes. Recent advancements have highlighted that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), act as central regulators in a wide array of biogenesis and biological functions, exerting control over gene expression associated with histogenesis and cellular differentiation within ocular tissues. Abnormal expression and activity of ncRNAs has been linked to the regulation of diverse cellular functions such as apoptosis, and proliferation. This implies a potential involvement of ncRNAs in the development of DR. Notably, ncRNAs and apoptosis exhibit reciprocal regulatory interactions, jointly influencing the destiny of retinal cells. Consequently, a thorough investigation into the complex relationship between apoptosis and ncRNAs is crucial for developing effective therapeutic and preventative strategies for DR. This review provides a fundamental comprehension of the apoptotic signaling pathways associated with DR. It then delves into the mutual relationship between apoptosis and ncRNAs in the context of DR pathogenesis. This study advances our understanding of the pathophysiology of DR and paves the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Sharma, Sophie Dvali, Andrew M Leifer",2022,"A fundamental problem in neuroscience is understanding how a network's properties dictate its function. Connectomics provides one avenue to predict nervous system function. To test this explicitly, we systematically measure signal propagation in 23,427 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory), strength, temporal properties, and causal direction of signal propagation between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal propagation differs from predictions based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show that extrasynaptic signaling not visible from anatomy contributes to this difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle dependent signaling on seconds-or-less timescales that evoke acute calcium transients often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides and receptors are expressed. We propose that here extrasynaptically released neuropeptides serve a similar function as that of classical neurotransmitters. Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts neural dynamics of spontaneous activity than does anatomy. We conclude that both synaptic and extrasynaptic signaling drive neural dynamics on short timescales and that measurement of evoked signal propagation are critical for interpreting neural function.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/959eb2790a6a167c4d7fe85507415143720a70aa,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04790.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/959eb2790a6a167c4d7fe85507415143720a70aa,,"Biology, Physics, Biology",4,74a210dc936fe7c42c1df7ae161a35de,,2208.04790,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Klingmann, R. Kahoul, Marc Hommel, Emmanuel Pham, A. Kulesza",2022,"Health technology assessment (HTA) aims to be a systematic, transparent, unbiased synthesis of clinical efficacy, safety, and value of medical products (MPs) to help policymakers, payers, clinicians, and industry to make informed decisions. The evidence available for HTA has gaps—impeding timely prediction of the individual long-term effect in real clinical practice. Also, appraisal of an MP needs cross-stakeholder communication and engagement. Both aspects may benefit from extended use of modeling and simulation. Modeling is used in HTA for data-synthesis and health-economic projections. In parallel, regulatory consideration of model informed drug development (MIDD) has brought attention to mechanistic modeling techniques that could in fact be relevant for HTA. The ability to extrapolate and generate personalized predictions renders the mechanistic MIDD approaches suitable to support translation between clinical trial data into real-world evidence. In this perspective, we therefore discuss concrete examples of how mechanistic models could address HTA-related questions. We shed light on different stakeholder's contributions and needs in the appraisal phase and suggest how mechanistic modeling strategies and reporting can contribute to this effort. There are still barriers dissecting the HTA space and the clinical development space with regard to modeling: lack of an adapted model validation framework for decision-making process, inconsistent and unclear support by stakeholders, limited generalizable use cases, and absence of appropriate incentives. To address this challenge, we suggest to intensify the collaboration between competent authorities, drug developers and modelers with the aim to implement mechanistic models central in the evidence generation, synthesis, and appraisal of HTA so that the totality of mechanistic and clinical evidence can be leveraged by all relevant stakeholders.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/877d5b1b75599745f704a9c8371f74601ff17e2f,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmedt.2022.810315/pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/877d5b1b75599745f704a9c8371f74601ff17e2f,Frontiers in Medical Technology,"Medicine, Medicine, Economics",4,086783a42a2ebf684e14f32aed0dbb8a,10.3389/fmedt.2022.810315,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00

The circuit localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g., attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g., sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and align those features to a task-relevant causal variable. Using MIB, we find that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit localization.

Drawing on identifiability in statistics, where parameters are uniquely inferred under specific assumptions, we explore the identifiability of MI explanations. We identify two main MI strategies: (1)""where-then-what,""which isolates a circuit replicating model behavior before interpreting it, and (2)""what-then-where,""which starts with candidate algorithms and searches for neural activation subspaces implementing them, using causal alignment. We test both strategies on Boolean functions and small multi-layer perceptrons, fully enumerating candidate explanations. Our experiments reveal systematic non-identifiability: multiple circuits can replicate behavior, a circuit can have multiple interpretations, several algorithms can align with the network, and one algorithm can align with different subspaces. Is uniqueness necessary? A pragmatic approach may require only predictive and manipulability standards. If uniqueness is essential for understanding, stricter criteria may be needed.

We evaluate SIIT on sparse transformers produced by the Tracr tool and find that SIIT models maintain Tracr's original circuit while being more realistic.

This article traces the historical development of M&E, from early compliance reporting to the Logical Framework Approach (LogFrame), Results-Based Management (RBM), and Theory of Change (ToC). It demonstrates how these frameworks shaped contemporary practice and continue to influence approaches to program design and assessment.

Special attention is given to the challenges of implementing M&E in low-resource contexts, including financial constraints, limited technical expertise, and cultural barriers. The discussion highlights practical strategies such as capacity building, participatory methods, and the use of mobile technology to improve data collection and reporting.

Golpayegani",2021,"In today’s world, crowdsourcing is regarded as an effective strategy to deal with a high volume of small issues whose solutions can have their own complexities in systems. Moreover, requesters are currently providing hundreds of thousands of tasks in online job markets and workers need to perform these tasks to earn money. Thus far, various aspects of crowdsourcing including budget management, mechanism design for price management, forcing workers to behave truthfully in bidding prices, or maximized gains of crowdsourcing have been considered in different studies. One of the main existing challenges in crowdsourcing is how to ensure truthful reporting is provided by contributing workers. Since the amount of pay to workers is directly correlated with the number of tasks performed by them over a period of time, it can be predicted that strong incentives encourage them to carry out more tasks by giving untruthful answers (providing the first possible answer without examining it) in order to increase the amount of pay. However, crowdsourcing requesters need to obtain truthful reporting as an output of tasks assigned to workers. In this study, a mechanism was developed whose implementation in crowdsourcing could ensure truthful reporting by workers. The mechanism provided in this study was evaluated as more budget feasible and it was also fairer for requesters and workers due to its well-defined procedure.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae072c19afa03bc441bc636cbce4263942563de3,https://www.mdpi.com/0718-1876/16/6/113/pdf?version=1627290771,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae072c19afa03bc441bc636cbce4263942563de3,Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",3,aa5b376d3db258c07cfd5b618d211136,10.3390/jtaer16060113,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Employing regression discontinuity (RD) design as our main identification strategy and the smaller reporting company rule (SRC rule) as the exogenous source of variation, we show that smaller reporting companies (SRCs), which are permitted to provide scaled disclosures in their 10-Ks, experience significantly and economically higher default risk. We demonstrate that, while there is no effect of information loss if a smaller reporting company voluntarily maintains its disclosure level by continuing to report its financial performance in full, there is an increase in its default risk due to the loss of commitment to mandatory disclosure. We also find that, compared to previously qualified SRCs, newly qualified smaller reporting companies face steeper increases in bankruptcy risk during their first year of eligibility. Our analysis indicates that strong external oversight mechanisms, better corporate governance, and credible audit quality attenuate the negative impact of reduced disclosure levels on the risk of default.

Berry",2023,"When it is difficult to verify contributed solutions in mobile crowdsourcing, the majority voting mechanism is widely utilized to incentivize distributed workers to provide high-quality and truthful solutions. In the majority voting mechanism, a worker is rewarded based on whether his solution is consistent with the majority. However, most prior related work relies on a strong assumption that workers’ solution accuracy levels are public knowledge, which may not hold in many practical scenarios. We relax such an assumption and propose an online mechanism, which allows the platform to learn the distribution of the workers’ solution accuracy levels via asking workers to report their private accuracy levels (which do not need to be the true values), in addition to deciding their effort levels and solution reporting strategies. The mechanism design is challenging, as neither the workers’ task solutions nor their accuracy reports can be verified. We devise a randomized reward mechanism that computes the workers’ rewards based on their reported accuracy levels, under which the workers obtain rewards if their reported solutions match the majority. We show that our mechanism induces workers to truthfully report their solution accuracy levels in the long run, in which the empirical accuracy distribution (collected from workers’ accuracy reports) converges to the actual accuracy distribution. Moreover, we show that our online mechanism converges faster when the workers are more capable of solving the tasks.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f3e3c13cea63b13a794fedc8639847f6f8cec4c,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f3e3c13cea63b13a794fedc8639847f6f8cec4c,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"Computer Science, Computer Science",3,cfb6136fd50626919fb8c54c447f1a64,10.1109/TMC.2022.3172965,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Compared with the classical setting, here we aim to design mechanisms that can both incentivize most agents to truthfully report their data and preserve the privacy of individuals' reports, while their outputs should also close to the underlying parameter. In the first part of the paper, we consider the case where the covariates are sub-Gaussian and the responses are heavy-tailed where they only have the finite fourth moments. First, motivated by the stationary condition of the maximizer of the likelihood function, we derive a novel private and closed form estimator. Based on the estimator, we propose a mechanism which has the following properties via some appropriate design of the computation and payment scheme for several canonical models such as linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression: (1) the mechanism is $o(1)$-jointly differentially private (with probability at least $1-o(1)$); (2) it is an $o(\frac{1}{n})$-approximate Bayes Nash equilibrium for a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of agents to truthfully report their data, where $n$ is the number of agents; (3) the output could achieve an error of $o(1)$ to the underlying parameter; (4) it is individually rational for a $(1-o(1))$ fraction of agents in the mechanism ; (5) the payment budget required from the analyst to run the mechanism is $o(1)$. In the second part, we consider the linear regression model under more general setting where both covariates and responses are heavy-tailed and only have finite fourth moments.

Y/N; do you like Squirtle? Y/N), peer prediction aims to design mechanisms that encourage honest feedback without verification. A series of works have successfully designed multi-task peer prediction mechanisms where reporting truthfully is better than any other strategy (dominantly truthful), while they require an infinite number of tasks. A recent work proposes the first multi-task peer prediction mechanism, Determinant Mutual Information (DMI)-Mechanism, where not only is dominantly truthful but also works for a finite number of tasks (practical). However, the existence of other practical dominantly-truthful multi-task peer prediction mechanisms remains to be an open question. This work answers the above question by providing 1. a new family of information-monotone information measures: volume mutual information (VMI), where DMI is a special case; 2. a new family of practical dominantly-truthful multi-task peer prediction mechanisms, VMI-Mechanisms. To illustrate the importance of VMI-Mechanisms, we also provide a tractable effort incentive optimization goal. We show that DMI-Mechanism may not be not optimal but we can construct a sequence of VMI-Mechanisms that are approximately optimal. The main technical highlight in this paper is a novel geometric information measure, Volume Mutual Information, that is based on a simple idea: we can measure an object A's information amount by the number of objects that is less informative than A. Different densities over the object lead to different information measures. This also gives Determinant Mutual Information a simple geometric interpretation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcdaa96fb8454b536567c355a1dbf32f530c0b6f,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02214.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcdaa96fb8454b536567c355a1dbf32f530c0b6f,Information Technology Convergence and Services,"Computer Science, Computer Science",3,fc818fca640b6ca4665c631bcbe80b2e,10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2022.95,2103.02214,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

It allows the designer to restrict attention to truthful mechanisms, greatly facilitating analysis. This is also borne out algorithmically, allowing certain computational problems in mechanism design to be solved in polynomial time. Unfortunately, when not every type can misreport every other type (the partial verification model) or—more generally—misreporting can be costly, the revelation principle can fail to hold. This also leads to NP-hardness results. The primary contribution of this article consists of characterizations of conditions under which the revelation principle still holds when reporting can be costly. (These are generalizations of conditions given earlier for the partial verification case [11, 21].) Furthermore, our results extend to cases where, instead of reporting types directly, agents send signals that do not directly correspond to types. In this case, we obtain conditions for when the mechanism designer can restrict attention to a given (but arbitrary) mapping from types to signals without loss of generality.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19d4f59611af7ea83b171d30918695a0b2c74f05,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19d4f59611af7ea83b171d30918695a0b2c74f05,ACM Trans.

Choo, Zhaohui Yang, Zhili Sun, H. Cruickshank",2023,"For large-scale battery-swapping demands, reservations are utilized to effectively manage battery swapping. To achieve data security, one promising solution is heterogeneous signcryption (i.e. signature + encryption). However, existing heterogeneous signcryption cannot simultaneously support aggregation, batch verification, conditional privacy-preserving, bidirectional heterogeneous communication, and availability. Besides, to reduce the end-to-end delays, mobile edge computing (MEC) is introduced to reservations, so other challenge is to design an incentive mechanism to encourage mobile edge nodes (MENs) to transmit reservation messages. Seeking to address these challenges, we propose a reservation scheme with conditional privacy-preserving bidirectional heterogeneous aggregate signcryption and incentive mechanism, namely SecBS. More precisely, in status publication (i.e. SecBS-SP), electric vehicles (EVs) obtain status messages released by battery swapping stations (BSSs) via MENs, which is realized via heterogeneous signcryption from certificateless cryptosystem (CLC) to identity-based cryptosystem (IBC). In the reservation (i.e. SecBS-R), under the incentive, MENs transmit reservations sent by EVs to BSSs, which is realized via heterogeneous signcryption from IBC to CLC.

Pennock",2023,"We draw a surprising and direct mathematical equivalence between the class of fair division mechanisms, designed to allocate divisible goods without money, and the class of weakly budget-balanced wagering mechanisms, designed to elicit probabilities. Although this correspondence between fair division and wagering has applications in both settings, we focus on its implications for the design of incentive-compatible fair division mechanisms. In particular, we show that applying the correspondence to competitive scoring rules, a prominent class of wagering mechanisms based on proper scoring rules, yields the first incentive-compatible fair division mechanism that is both fair (proportional and envy-free) and responsive to agent preferences. Moreover, for two agents, we show that competitive scoring rules characterize the whole class of nonwasteful and incentive-compatible fair division mechanisms, subject to mild technical conditions. As one of several consequences, this allows us to resolve an open question about the best possible approximation to optimal utilitarian welfare that can be achieved by any incentive-compatible mechanism. Finally, because the equivalence greatly expands the set of known incentive-compatible fair division mechanisms, we conclude with an evaluation of this entire set, comparing the mechanisms’ axiomatic properties and examining their welfare performance in simulation.

A number of mature incentive mechanisms have been proposed to address the worker recruitment problem in MCS systems. However, most of them assume that there is a large enough worker pool and a sufficient number of users can be selected. This may be impossible in large-scale crowdsourcing environments. To address this challenge, we consider the MCS system defined on a location-aware social network provided by a social platform. In this system, we can recruit a small number of seed workers from the existing worker pool to spread the information of multiple tasks in the social network, thus attracting more users to perform tasks. In this article, we propose a Multi-Task Diffusion Maximization (MT-DM) problem that aims to maximize the total utility of performing multiple crowdsourcing tasks under the budget. To accommodate multiple tasks diffusion over a social network, we create a multi-task diffusion model, and based on this model, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism, MT-DM-L. To deal with the high complexity of computing the multi-task diffusion, we adopt Multi-Task Reverse Reachable (MT-RR) sets to approximate the utility of information diffusion efficiently. Through both complete theoretical analysis and extensive simulations by using real-world datasets, we validate that our estimation for the spread of multi-task diffusion is accurate and the proposed mechanism achieves individual rationality, truthfulness, computational efficiency, and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(1-1/\sqrt{e}-\varepsilon)$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>ɛ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=""guo-ieq1-3310383.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> approximation with at least <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$1-\delta$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=""guo-ieq2-3310383.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> probability.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/191677aa299b707eec5208e42bcfdd2377d1128c,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12460,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/191677aa299b707eec5208e42bcfdd2377d1128c,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"Computer Science, Computer Science",3,accb3414e51c99e80574c4e4060a6bbd,10.1109/TMC.2023.3310383,2303.12460,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

However, future superhuman models will surpass the capability of humans.
Therefore, humans will only be able to weakly supervise superhuman models.
This expected deficiency of human evaluation would weaken the safety of future AI systems.
Scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization are two complementary approaches to tackle this issue.
In this paper, we attempt to combine the strengths of these two approaches to further improve alignment.
Specifically, we investigate ways of improving human supervision with a strong pretrained model and then supervise the strong model with enhanced weak human supervision.
To make iterative empirical progress, we consider an analogy: can we use a strong model to improve weak model supervision and then use it to supervise the strong model?
We empirically test it by finetuning a small weak model on ground truth labels with the additional help from a large strong model, and then finetuning the strong model on labels generated by the weak model.
We find that debate can assist a weak model in extracting trustworthy information from an untrustworthy strong model, which provides leverage as context on samples when training a weak model.
We also show that an ensemble of weak models helps exploit long arguments generated by strong model debaters and obtain a more robust supervision estimate.
Extensive experiments on the OpenAI weak-to-strong NLP benchmarks show that the combination approach leads to better alignment, which indicates that debate has the potential to help weak-to-strong generalization.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f713b439266e6cc1415025da056f1304f2b78b8a,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13124.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f713b439266e6cc1415025da056f1304f2b78b8a,AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Computer Science, Computer Science",3,40d0cf351683fd86dedebf99189084ca,10.48550/arXiv.2501.13124,2501.13124,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Thurner, Kshitij Ranganath",2021,"Data Analytics provides core business reporting needs in many software companies, acts as a source of truth for key information, and enables building advanced solutions, e.g., predictive models, machine learning, real-time recommendations, to grow the business. A self-service, multi-tenant, API-first, and scalable data platform is the foundational requirement in creating an enterprise data marketplace, which enables the creation, publishing, and exchange of data products. Such a marketplace enables the exploration and discovery of data products, further providing high-level data governance and oversight on marketplace contents. In this paper, we describe our way to the gourmet data product marketplace. We cover the design principles, the implementation details, technology choices, and the journey to build an enterprise data platform that meets the above characteristics. The platform consists of ingestion, streaming, storage, transformation, schema generation, fail-safe, data sharing, access management, PII data automatic identification, self-service storage optimization recommendations, and CI/CD integration. We then show how the platform enables and operates the data marketplace, facilitating the exchange of stable data products across users and tenants. We motivate and show how we run scalable decentralized data governance. All of this is built and run for Cimpress Technology (CT), which operates the Mass Customization Platform for Cimpress and its businesses.

Goal misgeneralization, a type of robustness failure in RL occurs when an agent retains its capabilities out-of-distribution yet pursues a proxy rather than the intended one. Our approach utilizes LLMs to analyze an RL agent's policies during training and identify potential failure scenarios. The RL agent is then deployed in these scenarios, and a reward model is learnt through the LLM preferences and feedback. This LLM-informed reward model is used to further train the RL agent on the original dataset. We apply our method to a maze navigation task, and show marked improvements in goal generalization, especially in cases where true and proxy goals are somewhat distinguishable and behavioral biases are pronounced.

Rather than treating opacity as a design flaw, LoBOX defines it as a condition that can be ethically governed through role-calibrated explanation and institutional accountability. The framework comprises a three-stage pathway: reduce accidental opacity, bound irreducible opacity, and delegate trust through structured oversight. Integrating the RED/BLUE XAI model for stakeholder-sensitive explanation and aligned with emerging legal instruments such as the EU AI Act, LoBOX offers a scalable and context-aware alternative to transparency-centric approaches. Reframe trust not as a function of complete system explainability, but as an outcome of institutional credibility, structured justification, and stakeholder-responsive accountability. A governance loop cycles back to ensure that LoBOX remains responsive to evolving technological contexts and stakeholder expectations, to ensure the complete opacity governance. We move from transparency ideals to ethical governance, emphasizing that trustworthiness in AI must be institutionally grounded and contextually justified. We also discuss how cultural or institutional trust varies in different contexts.

Ng, Ivan Tjuawinata, Chao Li, Jielin Yang, Sai None Myne, Huaxiong Wang, K. Lam, C. J. Kuo",2021,"Data privacy is an important issue for organizations and enterprises to securely outsource data storage, sharing, and computation on clouds / fogs. However, data encryption is complicated in terms of the key management and distribution; existing secure computation techniques are expensive in terms of computational / communication cost and therefore do not scale to big data computation. Tensor network decomposition and distributed tensor computation have been widely used in signal processing and machine learning for dimensionality reduction and large-scale optimization. However, the potential of distributed tensor networks for big data privacy preservation have not been considered before, this motivates the current study. Our primary intuition is that tensor network representations are mathematically non-unique, unlinkable, and uninterpretable; tensor network representations naturally support a range of multilinear operations for compressed and distributed / dispersed computation. Therefore, we propose randomized algorithms to decompose big data into randomized tensor network representations and analyze the privacy leakage for 1D to 3D data tensors. The randomness mainly comes from the complex structural information commonly found in big data; randomization is based on controlled perturbation applied to the tensor blocks prior to decomposition. The distributed tensor representations are dispersed on multiple clouds / fogs or servers / devices with metadata privacy, this provides both distributed trust and management to seamlessly secure big data storage, communication, sharing, and computation. Experiments show that the proposed randomization techniques are helpful for big data anonymization and efficient for big data storage and computation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a2b01c7358d0a23873dec7c3f4d7cc3ab74a590,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04194.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a2b01c7358d0a23873dec7c3f4d7cc3ab74a590,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics",3,e0f21aff4ecfb3d13d35c2ef037f40b3,,2101.04194,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Bräm, Gilbert Koch, K. Allegaert, J. van den Anker, M. Pfister",2024,"Serum creatinine in neonates follows complex dynamics due to maturation processes, most pronounced in the first few weeks of life. The development of a mechanism‐based model describing complex dynamics requires high expertise in pharmacometric (PMX) modeling and substantial model development time. A recently published machine learning (ML) approach of low‐dimensional neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) is capable of modeling such data from newborns automatically. However, this efficient data‐driven approach in itself does not result in a clinically interpretable model. In this work, an approach to deriving an interpretable model with reasonable PMX‐type functions is presented. This “translation” was applied to derive a PMX model for serum creatinine in neonates considering maturation processes and covariates. The developed model was compared to a previously published mechanism‐based PMX model whereas both models had similar mechanistic structures. The developed model was then utilized to simulate serum creatinine concentrations in the first few weeks of life considering different covariate values for gestational age and birth weight. The reference serum creatinine values derived from these simulations are consistent with observed serum creatinine values and previously published reference values. Thus, the presented NODE‐based ML approach to model complex serum creatinine dynamics in newborns and derive interpretable, mathematical‐statistical components similar to those in a conventional PMX model demonstrates a novel, viable approach to facilitate the modeling of complex dynamics in clinical settings and pediatric drug development.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5fae58343bde99a83efb245281ab69b262f4cd7f,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jcph.2460,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5fae58343bde99a83efb245281ab69b262f4cd7f,Journal of clinical pharmacology,"Medicine, Medicine",3,f9e79f53ca14c6cbf5110c9c92ea0331,10.1002/jcph.2460,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

However, although FCSDL is not impacted by random fluctuations and can rapidly reconstruct fault shock without truncating the signal, its performance for repetitive fault shock reconstruction is not optimal when dealing with strong noise vibration signals. Therefore, this article proposes cyclostationary convolutional sparse dictionary learning (CCSDL), which is guided by fault features (cyclostationarity) to achieve the greatest signal reconstruction performance. First, the proposed method is based on the rotation frequency, and various frequency-band-covering components in the vibration signal are reconstructed successively. In the meanwhile, the harmonic significance index (HSI), which can indicate the cyclostationarity of the fault shock, evaluates the fault characteristics of each reconstruction result and finally obtains the most significant reconstruction result.

We use multi-subject resting-state fMRI data from 358 subjects and form subject-specific tFNC feature vectors from ICA results. Then, we learn sparse representations of the tFNCs and introduce a new set of sparse features as well as new interpretable patterns from the learned atoms. Our experimental results show that the new representation not only leads to effective classification between HC and Sz groups using sparse features, but can also identify new interpretable patterns from the learned atoms that can help understand the complexities of mental diseases such as schizophrenia.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2460c8d0678b26756bb6dc3d2ead02ce78d03e0,https://mdsoar.org/bitstreams/07c1e102-4064-4d9e-9d9a-c87a17db68be/download,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2460c8d0678b26756bb6dc3d2ead02ce78d03e0,"IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","Computer Science, Biology, Computer Science",3,5493256c07df269231b3ae00ccfa532a,10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096473,2211.07374,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Deep learning (DL)-based pansharpening methods have demonstrated impressive results in generating high-quality HRMS images. However, they suffer from a lack of interpretability due to their black-box network architectures. Recently, model-based deep unrolling networks have been proposed to improve the interpretability of networks. Among these approaches, the multisource convolutional sparse coding (MCSC)-based models stand out by effectively learning common and unique features from both LRMS and PAN images, showing promising results. As the LRMS image provides limited information in MCSC-based models, it can result in weak feature response and even lead to incorrect fusion outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep MCSC-based method that enhances the robustness and performance. Specifically, we build an optimization model that integrates MCSC with a degradation model and a deep prior, which can sufficiently capture the common information shared by the latent HRMS images and PAN images, thereby enabling the recovery of more accurate spectral information. To optimize the proposed model, we adopt an iterative optimization strategy that unfolds the iterative solution into networks. Moreover, we propose an enhanced version of our method that utilizes multiscale dictionaries to capture common and unique features at different scales, thereby facilitating the extraction of more abundant spectral and spatial details. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on multiple benchmark datasets.

Biologically accurate, energy efficient neuromorphic systems are particularly promising for enabling future breakthroughs because of their ability to process information in parallel and to scale using extremely low power. Sparse coding is a signal processing technique which has been known to model the information encoding in the primary visual cortex. When sparse solutions are solved using local neuron competition along with the unsupervised dictionary learning that mimics cortical development, we can build an end to end, hardware to software, brain inspired solution to a machine learning problem. In this article, we perform a detailed comparison of sparse coding solutions generated classically by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) implemented on a conventional digital processor with spike-based solutions obtained using the Intel Loihi neuromorphic processor. A novel “post-hoc” normalization technique to shorten simulation time for Loihi is presented along with analysis of optimal parameter selection, reconstruction errors, and unsupervised dictionary learning for Loihi approaches and their classical counterparts. Preliminary results show that both the Loihi full simulation approach and the post-hoc normalization approach are well suited to neuromorphic processors and operate in a size, weight and power regime that is not accessible by classical approaches.

This learning framework has led to state-of-the-art results in various signal processing tasks. However, classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternating optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or convergence due to the non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the development of non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex approaches learned the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an atom-by-atom manner, which led to a long execution time. More recent works  have sought to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is degraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed scheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage optimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary recovery performance by a finite number of samples. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme can exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of samples.

There is a need for solutions in processing untargeted MS data, independent of chemical or origin, to assess features based on measurement quality with the aim of improving interpretation. Here, we report the signal response evaluation as a method by which to assess the individual features observed in untargeted MS data. The basis of this method is the ubiquitous relationship between the amount and response in all MS measurements. Three different metrics with user-defined parameters can be used to assess the monotonic or linear relationship of each feature in a dilution series or multiple injection volumes.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is widely used in acquisition of digital elevation data as well as the settlement of Earth surface. Researching on the processing of space-born InSAR is of great importance in improving the accuracy of sensing data. The phase denoising method based on multi-resolution dictionary sparse coding (SC) is proposed. First, noisy blocks are extracted from the complex valued interferometric image. Then, the dictionary is trained by online method, which uses a portion of elements in the training set to update the dictionary column by column. And the trained dictionary is used to sparsely represent the noisy blocks by greedy method to denoise the image patches with different resolutions. The whole image of a given resolution is formed by combining the patches in the same resolution together. Finally, the denoising results of different resolutions are merged based on hypothesis testing and the phase estimations according to each pixels are computed. The experiments prove that the proposed denoising method based on multi-resolution SC achieves higher peak signal to noise ratio than traditional SC method.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fab97fd212fbb63ff112f9120c55f8fa778720dc,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fab97fd212fbb63ff112f9120c55f8fa778720dc,J.

Schimpf, Nam Lign, Ying Liu",2023,"Modern hybrid video codecs split their video content into blocks. These blocks are predicted and the difference between original and predicted block is calculated. This residual block is transformed by a discrete cosine transform (DCT) from the pixel domain into the frequency domain and quantized by a dead-zone quantizer (DZQ), which removes high frequency signals, depending on the quantization parameter (QP). DZQ has an extended zone around zero, which acts as a noise-gate, removing noise as intended but also removing useful signals. DCT and DZQ are not the optimal solution, they create distortions and side effects at lower bitrates. In contrast, sparse coding does not have these problems at lower bitrates, but it compresses inefficient at higher bit rates. We propose a method to add sparse coding as an alternate transform, which is controlled by a rate-distortion optimization (RDO) decision, in a semi-extreme sparse coding (SESC) setup and uses a semi-extreme dictionary training (SEDT) process. It is integrated into the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) test model HM-16.18 and screen content coding (HEVC-SCC) test model HM-16.18+SCM-8.7.

This paper proposes a fault feature extraction method based on an optimized Laplacian wavelet dictionary (LWD) and the feature symbol search (FSS) algorithm to extract early fault characteristic frequencies of bearings under low SNR. As the morphological parameters of the Laplace wavelet dictionary and sparse coefficients are not easy to obtain, this method uses the adaptive empirical wavelet transform (AEWT) to determine the morphological parameters of the Laplace wavelet. Firstly, AEWT is applied to obtain the different frequency components, and the combination index is utilized for optimal component selection. Then, the morphological parameters of LWD are determined by AEWT processing, by which the overcomplete dictionary that best matches the signal can be obtained. Finally, the optimal sparse representation of the component signal in the dictionary is calculated by FSS, which helps to achieve sparse denoising and enhance the impact features. The effectiveness of the method is verified by simulation. The effectiveness and advantages of LWDFSS-AEWT are verified by experiment in comparison with methods such as fast spectral kurtosis (FSK), correlation filtering (CF), shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC), base pursuit denoising (BPDN) and wavelet packet transform Kurtogram (WPT Kurtogram).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba0c2353e8ab2a7831e5bcd30c72a6cd071b9e09,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/21/10807/pdf?version=1667793621,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba0c2353e8ab2a7831e5bcd30c72a6cd071b9e09,Applied Sciences,Engineering,3,d3bcc30117b9b407b88e7e3b641604da,10.3390/app122110807,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:59.362493+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:59.362493+00:00

Aoi",2023,"A number of recent studies have sought to understand the behavior of artificial and biological neural networks by comparing representations across layers, networks and brain areas. Simultaneously, there has been growing interest in using dimensionality of a dataset as a proxy for computational complexity. At the intersection of these topics, studies exploring the dimensionality of shared computational and representational subspaces have relied on model-based methods, but a standard, model-free measure is lacking. Here we present a candidate measure for shared dimensionality that we call the effective number of shared dimensions (ENSD). The ENSD can be applied to data matrices sharing at least one dimension, reduces to the well-known participation ratio when both data sets are equivalent and has a number of other robust and intuitive mathematical properties. Notably, the ENSD can be written as a similarity metric that is a re-scaled version of centered kernel alignment (CKA) but additionally describes the dimensionality of the aligned subspaces. Unlike methods like canonical correlation analysis (CCA), the ENSD is robust to cases where data is sparse or low rank. We demonstrate its utility and computational efficiency by a direct comparison of CKA and ENSD on across-layer similarities in convolutional neural networks as well as by recovering results from recent studies in neuroscience on communication subspaces between brain regions. Finally, we demonstrate how the ENSD and its constituent statistics allow us to perform a variety of multi-modal analyses of multivariate datasets. Specifically, we use connectomic data to probe the alignment of parallel pathways in the fly olfactory system, revealing novel results in the interaction between innate and learned olfactory representations.

We evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active. This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening -- not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision, enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45b62536916ef2dd694f102eb492a0d2a4ea2fc1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08977.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45b62536916ef2dd694f102eb492a0d2a4ea2fc1,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",3,5e418b2dd8554efbfffb3a03e81c850e,10.48550/arXiv.2507.08977,2507.08977,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:35.344820+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:35.344820+00:00

Notably, most interpretability papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps'complexity and accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question: causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information. Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal abstraction should lead to exciting future work.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4d81c89c973b6d207dbc0562760200b7d7974ed,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08802.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4d81c89c973b6d207dbc0562760200b7d7974ed,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Philosophy",3,70362e7b30ccc664b2d26f55c87a5833,10.48550/arXiv.2507.08802,2507.08802,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Philosophy'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:26.242445+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:57.902361+00:00

Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias.

In this paper, we apply mechanistic interpretability methods to analyze the visual question answering (VQA) mechanisms in the first MLLM, Llava. We compare the mechanisms between VQA and textual QA (TQA) in color answering tasks and find that: a) VQA exhibits a mechanism similar to the in-context learning mechanism observed in TQA; b) the visual features exhibit significant interpretability when projecting the visual embeddings into the embedding space; and c) Llava enhances the existing capabilities of the corresponding textual LLM Vicuna during visual instruction tuning. Based on these findings, we develop an interpretability tool to help users and researchers identify important visual locations for final predictions, aiding in the understanding of visual hallucination.

We explore the potential for mechanisms to be used to achieve consensus that are triggered when there is a dispute impeding consensus. Using the feature that nodes stake tokens in proof of stake (POS) protocols, we construct revelation mechanisms in which the unique (subgame perfect) equilibrium involves validating nodes propose truthful blocks using only the information that exists amongst all nodes.

Agent $i$ incurs a cost $c_{i,k}$ to sample from $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)$. Instead of working independently, agents can exchange data, collecting cheaper samples and sharing them in return for costly data, thereby reducing both costs and estimation error. We design a mechanism to facilitate such collaboration, while addressing two key challenges: ensuring individually rational (IR) and fair outcomes so all agents benefit, and preventing strategic behavior (e.g. non-collection, data fabrication) to avoid socially undesirable outcomes. We design a mechanism and an associated Nash equilibrium (NE) which minimizes the social penalty-sum of agents'estimation errors and collection costs-while being IR for all agents. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation to the minimum social penalty in the worst case and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximation under favorable conditions.

However, in many applications, a user's valuation depends on other users' sensory data, which introduces the problem of interdependent valuations. This feature can encourage sensory data misreport, hence makes economic mechanisms challenging. While some work has been done to address this problem, the issues of private utility information and communication overheads remain unsolved. In this study, we formulate the first interdependent-valuation model for the resource-discovery MCS systems, aiming to elicit truthful sensory reports and utility information and to maximize expected social welfare. We design a Truthful Sense-And-Bid (T-SAB) Mechanism based on surrogate functions, which can reveal marginal utility information by only requiring each user to submit one-dimensional signaling per resource. We show that the surrogate function and a reward function can limit users' willingness to misreport, when users have small informational sizes, a reasonable condition in large-scale MCS systems. Consequently, our T-SAB Mechanism yields a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) with the efficient allocation outcome, approximate truthfulness, individual rationality, and approximate budget balance. To illustrate the effectiveness of the T-SAB Mechanism, we perform a case study of a cognitive radio network. We demonstrate that the social welfare gain of the T-SAB Mechanism can achieve up to 20% social welfare gain comparing with a benchmark.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/364919da72637c45f3548ddf7205e3bc80322aba,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/364919da72637c45f3548ddf7205e3bc80322aba,ACM Interational Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",2,0715813cb21aa980e7cf44887c9f334f,10.1145/3397166.3409147,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00
dd14704d29d6c848008a0ae43b3ce50ac0ccdf4a,Accountability as a mechanism and a virtue in Irish public sector recordkeeping,Mark Farrell,2024,"
Purpose
Although legislation and regulations form an important foundation for recordkeeping and for accountability, questions of transparency and openness must be addressed in a wider context. Oliver and Foscarini have argued for the importance of recognising differing cultures and the ways in which they value records and recordkeeping. In addition to reporting mechanisms and relationships, accountability must encompass a culture and a mindset which is transparent, responsive and focused on self-improvement. This paper aims to apply a dual interpretation of accountability in the context of Irish public sector recordkeeping to identify shortcomings and suggest potential remedies with a view to improving the accountability of Irish recordkeeping itself, and the extent to which it contributes to wider accountability in society.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper assesses accountability in Irish public sector recordkeeping using a model suggested by Mark Bovens, which views accountability as both a mechanism and a virtue. The model emphasises that both interpretations are necessary but that mechanisms (laws, regulations and checklists) on their own cannot be sufficient to satisfy accountability requirements. As noted by Onora O’Neill, the aim of accountability should not be checklists or artificial metrics, but the nurturing of behaviours and cultures which make public institutions more deserving of our trust. Reference will be made to Irish legislation, to records management policies in government departments, to relevant annual reports and to current practice with regard to appraisal and other recordkeeping functions to measure Irish public sector recordkeeping against Bovens' model.


Findings
This paper suggests that Irish public sector recordkeeping has a range of shortcomings under both the narrow (mechanism) and broad (virtue) interpretations of accountability. Lack of reporting requirements and oversight mechanisms in existing legislation allows for major gaps in public sector recordkeeping, facilitating a lack of accountability in the citizen–state relationship. Meanwhile, an absence of records management policies and an overall lack of appreciation of the value of records leads to opaque practices and a lack of transparency. The recordkeeping profession itself adopts processes and practices, which are not aligned with the concept of accountability as a virtue, and which do not reflect a commitment to transparency and meeting the legitimate interests of stakeholders. This paper suggests changes in relevant legislation but also suggests that these must be accompanied by a more open and responsive working culture within the recordkeeping profession.


Originality/value
By applying Bovens’ dual concept of accountability, this paper provides a new and more comprehensive assessment of public sector recordkeeping in Ireland, which can equally be applied in other contexts. It identifies ways in which revised legislation can contribute to greater accountability, but emphasises that regulations must be accompanied by a culture of transparency and responsiveness, and that recordkeepers have a crucial role to play in terms of their own commitment to transparency and professional accountability.

Nayyar",2020,"In this article, we consider the problem of designing an expected-revenue-maximizing mechanism for allocating multiple nonperishable goods of $k$ varieties to flexible consumers over $T$ time steps. In our model, a random number of goods of each variety may become available to the seller at each time, and a random number of consumers may enter the market at each time. Each consumer is present in the market for one time step and wants to consume one good of one of its desired varieties. Each consumer is associated with a flexibility level that indicates the varieties of goods it is equally interested in. A consumer’s flexibility level and the utility it gets from consuming a good of its desired varieties are its private information. We characterize the allocation rule for a Bayesian-incentive-compatible, individually rational, and expected-revenue-maximizing mechanism in terms of the solution to a dynamic program. The corresponding payment function is also specified in terms of the optimal allocation function. We leverage the structure of the consumers’ flexibility model to simplify the dynamic program. Our simplified dynamic program allows us to provide an explicit allocation procedure and a simple payment rule in terms of the solution of the dynamic program.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6f550aab2d6142d22de4f8c0ee15cb446b922aa,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03007,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6f550aab2d6142d22de4f8c0ee15cb446b922aa,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"Computer Science, Engineering, Economics",2,429053e7cd3211477bdb151d58463b5d,10.1109/TAC.2022.3184394,2007.03007,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Recent changes, specifically, the increasing renewable integration, have challenged such assumptions. In light of this shift, this thesis intends to devise new frameworks and advance our understanding of the future markets. The first part focuses on mechanism design when the model fully reflects the physics of the grid and the participants. We consider a market that involves continuous goods, general nonconvex constraints, and second stage costs. We then design the payments and conditions under which coalitions cannot influence the outcome. Under the incentive-compatible VCG mechanism, we prove that coalition-proof outcomes are achieved if bids are convex and constraints are polymatroids. By relaxing incentive-compatibility, we investigate core-selecting mechanisms that are coalition-proof without conditions. We show that they generalize the economic rationale of the LMP mechanism, and can approximate truthfulness without the price-taking assumption. Finally, they are budget-balanced. The second part coordinates regional markets to exploit the geographic diversification of renewables. In Europe, reserves remain an exclusive responsibility of regional operators. This limited coordination and the sequential structure hinder the utilization of generation and transmission. To promote reserve exchange, a preemptive model can optimally withdraw inter-area transmission capacity from day-ahead energy for reserves. This bilevel program however does not suggest costs that guarantee coordination. We formulate a new preemptive model that allows us to obtain stable benefits immune to deviations. Our proposal, least-core benefits, achieves minimal stability violation with a tractable computation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/864f043f205c85a14260b6db8848284793984df7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05047.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/864f043f205c85a14260b6db8848284793984df7,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Engineering",2,d256620fdee0963d64d888209ac02227,10.3929/ETHZ-B-000492146,2012.05047,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Cohen, Michelle C. Yuen, Mady N. Corrigan, Siyi Xu, Robert J. Wood",2024,"Networks of conductive nanoparticles have been used as electrodes for dielectric elastomer actuator multilayers because of their excellent extensibility and low added stiffness. Nanoparticle network topography, however, has typically effected a tradeoff between conductivity and breakdown strength. This has limited actuators to a corresponding tradeoff between either high operating frequencies and efficiencies or high stresses, strains, and energy densities. This tradeoff is resolved by spatially patterning multiple nanoparticles to produce hybrid electrodes. Sparse networks of high‐aspect‐ratio carbon nanotubes allow for self‐clearing in the body of the electrode, yielding 54.7 V µm−1 breakdown strength, 86.4% that of the neat elastomer. Dense networks of low‐aspect‐ratio carbon black at the external interfaces, meanwhile, provide low contact resistance (44.09 kΩmm). Two tools essential for their practical deployment are developed: a scalable fabrication process and an automated pre‐clearing algorithm. The fabrication method leverages the batch spray and stamp paradigm in concert with vacuum filtration to scalably deposit nanoparticle electrodes with minimal parameter tuning, enabling the production of a 100‐layer actuator capable of 14% strain. The adaptive pre‐clearing algorithm discriminates between and responds to a range of defect‐induced failures in newly fabricated actuators, eliminating the need for human oversight and standardizing the break‐in procedure.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/748cd8c639e42aa225cbf4ec2b11c5eec43d6317,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/748cd8c639e42aa225cbf4ec2b11c5eec43d6317,Advanced Materials & Technologies,"Engineering, Materials Science",2,057bf0c8d0723e6ea6b11557155c9f6f,10.1002/admt.202400787,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Materials Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

However, engagement remains challenging. Conversational agents can enhance engagement by making digital programs more interactive and personalized, but they have not been widely adopted. This study evaluated a digital program for anxiety in comparison to external comparators. The program used an artificial intelligence (AI)–driven conversational agent to deliver clinician-written content via machine learning, with clinician oversight and user support. Objective This study aims to evaluate the engagement, effectiveness, and safety of this structured, evidence-based digital program with human support for mild, moderate, and severe generalized anxiety. Statistical analyses sought to determine whether the program reduced anxiety more than a propensity-matched waiting control and was statistically noninferior to real-world, propensity-matched face-to-face and typed cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods Prospective participants (N=299) were recruited from the National Health Service (NHS) or social media in the United Kingdom and given access to the digital program for up to 9 weeks (study conducted from October 2023 to May 2024). End points were collected before, during, and after the digital program, as well as at a 1-month follow-up. External comparator groups were created through propensity matching of the digital program sample with NHS Talking Therapies (NHS TT) data from ieso Digital Health (typed CBT) and Dorset HealthCare (DHC) University NHS Foundation Trust (face-to-face CBT). Superiority and noninferiority analyses were conducted to compare anxiety symptom reduction (change on the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7]) between the digital program group and the external comparator groups. The program included human support, and clinician time spent per participant was calculated. Results Participants used the program for a median of 6 hours over 53 days, with 232 of the 299 (77.6%) engaged (ie, completing a median of 2 hours over 14 days). There was a large, clinically meaningful reduction in anxiety symptoms for the digital program group (per-protocol [PP; n=169]: mean GAD-7 change –7.4, d=1.6; intention-to-treat [ITT; n= 99]: mean GAD-7 change –5.4, d=1.1). The PP effect was statistically superior to the waiting control (d=1.3) and noninferior to the face-to-face CBT group (P<.001) and the typed CBT group (P<.001). Similarly, for the ITT sample, the digital program showed superiority to waiting control (d=0.8) and noninferiority to face-to-face CBT (P=.002), with noninferiority to typed CBT approaching significance (P=.06). Effects were sustained at the 1-month follow-up. Clinicians overseeing the digital program spent a mean of 1.6 hours (range 31-200 minutes) of clinician time in sessions per participant. Conclusions By combining AI and human support, the digital program achieved clinical outcomes comparable to human-delivered care, while significantly reducing the required clinician time by up to 8 times compared with global care estimates. These findings highlight the potential of technology to scale evidence-based mental health care, address unmet needs, and ultimately impact quality of life and reduce the economic burden globally.

Most work in this area has focused on methods of improving the quality of labels. Recent work by Burns et al. (2023) considers the complementary problem of training models with low-quality labels, finding that large pretrained models often have an inductive bias towards producing correct answers. In practice, however, neither label quantity nor quality is fixed: practitioners face a quantity-quality tradeoff. In this paper, we explore the microeconomics of the quantity-quality tradeoff on binary NLP classification tasks used in Burns et al. (2023). While sample-efficient learning has been studied extensively, little public research has focused on scalable elicitation: eliciting capabilities from pretrained models subject to labeling cost constraints. We find that this setting has novel dynamics caused by the tradeoff between label quantity and quality, as well as the model's existing latent capabilities. We observe three regimes of eliciting classification knowledge from pretrained models using supervised finetuning: quantity-dominant, quality-dominant, and a mixed regime involving the use of low- and high-quality data together to attain higher accuracy at a lower cost than using either alone. We explore sample-efficient elicitation methods that make use of two datasets of differing qualities, and establish a Pareto frontier of scalable elicitation methods that optimally trade off labeling cost and classifier performance. We find that the accuracy of supervised fine-tuning can be improved by up to 5 percentage points at a fixed labeling budget by adding a few-shot prompt to make use of the model's existing knowledge of the task.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b967aea341a153146d87e153bb7c897e0481def,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13215.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b967aea341a153146d87e153bb7c897e0481def,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science",2,dcdd569a017109ef682a7cb0050db085,10.48550/arXiv.2410.13215,2410.13215,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

McMahon, Ravi Madduri, Silvia Crivelli, Scott Damrauer, Kelly Cho, Rachel Ramoni, S. Muralidhar",2024,"Objectives
In 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) established an Interagency Agreement (IAA), the Million Veteran Program-Computational Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now (MVP-CHAMPION) research collaboration.


Materials and Methods
Oversight fell under the VA Office of Research Development (VA ORD) and DOE headquarters. An Executive Committee and 2 senior scientific liaisons work with VA and DOE leadership to optimize efforts in the service of shared scientific goals. The program supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including creation of a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. Cross-cutting methods including natural language processing, image processing, and reusable code were developed.


Results
The 79.6 million dollar collaboration has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes and launched over 10 collaborative scientific projects in health conditions highly prevalent in veterans. A ground-breaking analysis on the Summit and Andes supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants which resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) including large language natural language processing and a system biology study focused on opioid addiction awarded the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease, and cross-cutting data science. Predictive models developed in these projects are being tested for application in clinical management.


Discussion
Eight new projects were launched in 2023, taking advantage of the momentum generated by the previous collaboration. A major challenge has been limitations in the scope of appropriated funds at DOE which cannot currently be used for health research.


Conclusion
Extensive multidisciplinary interactions take time to establish and are essential to continued progress. New funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the ORNL and for supporting continued collaboration by joint VA-DOE research teams are needed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/efbf9f17bc0db579c2c105b4bf846d96defe9755,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooae126,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/efbf9f17bc0db579c2c105b4bf846d96defe9755,JAMIA Open,"Medicine, Medicine, Computer Science, Environmental Science",2,d234bd493e163f6b4f5a3c0df84ac695,10.1093/jamiaopen/ooae126,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Subratie, Renato J. O. Figueiredo",2024,"In the ever-evolving networking landscape, the demand for efficient and adaptable Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions is growing. Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), particularly Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay VPNs, offer a practical approach for networks spanning various edge and cloud providers. However, existing decentralized VPNs, while resilient and scalable, typically utilize a single tunnel type and overlook data plan costs and link performance in their selection processes. This oversight can lead to cost and performance inefficiencies, especially in edge-to-cloud networks where diverse nodes have unique needs that generic solutions fail to meet effectively. Although SDN facilitates the integration of multiple link types in overlay VPNs, existing systems lack efficient policies for selecting favorable tunnels. To bridge this gap, we introduce PolyNet, a Multi-Criteria approach designed to make cost- and performance-aware policy decisions in hybrid-link overlay networks. PolyNet employs a dynamic link selection policy during runtime that evaluates latency using Vivaldi network coordinates and considers cost, and integrates with SDN-based P2P overlays to enhance link management capabilities and support multiple link types. This paper presents the design of PolyNet and evaluates its performance through simulations and prototype testing. Results demonstrate that PolyNet achieves up to a 19.1% cost reduction and a 14.1% latency improvement over traditional methods in Symphony P2P topologies. Additionally, tests with a software prototype confirm the advantages of hybrid links, showing that kernel-layer GENEVE tunnels can increase throughput by up to 8.9 times compared to user-layer Nebula and WebRTC tunnels in edge clusters.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba4f4f8da3d580bf5b86032225ce9038babbc13a,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba4f4f8da3d580bf5b86032225ce9038babbc13a,IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Engineering",2,05ee9b6bca9b7cd6eb9fd135c53981e9,10.1109/NetSoft60951.2024.10588920,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Lou",2025,"Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is reshaping mobile network architecture by promoting openness, disaggregation, and cross-vendor interoperability. However, this architectural flexibility introduces new security challenges, especially in deployments where multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) jointly operate shared components. Existing Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) in O-RAN, as defined by governmental and industry standards, implicitly assume that authenticated components will comply with operational policies. However, this assumption creates a critical blind spot: misconfigured or compromised components can silently violate policies, misuse resources, or corrupt downstream processes (e.g., ML-based RIC xApps). To address this critical gap, we propose a monitoring framework for low-trust O-RAN environments that proactively verifies configuration state and control behavior against tenant-defined policies. Our system provides scalable, verifiable oversight to enhance transparency and trust in O-RAN operations.

This study reexamines time originally as potentially the most conserved attribute in physics, considering the quantum nature of well-known established by thermodynamic fundamentalistic energy conservation. Literature surveys quoting time conservation versus energy physics studies, especially quantum gravity, Page–Wootters formalism, and related areas with concept of time as emergent and travel phenomena associated to time as a wavefunction tensor have been highlighted. Mathematical theory derivations showing conservation of time principle with tensor analysis giving key equations and establishing time invariance with point in space via differential testing in relation to domains of reality of time tensor, = constant proves that conservation of time applies like the general principle of energy quantum conservation well within given conditions. Quantified clocks applying time conservation principle analyze strong gravity versus weak gravity environments like microblackholes and the zero-point fields, showing how branes may produce curled up dimensions, like Kaluza-Klein 5D curled up dimensions. Verifications with experimental methods, especially testing time conservation potentially would uncover new fundamental principles of physics - time conservation principle after establishment will propel to revolutionize our understanding of the universe and drive innovation in both theoretical and applied physics, specifically quantum technologies and astrophysical endeavors, especially measurement techniques with LHC, for example have been considered to launch research efforts of the future.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b667ffa06f591b7cb80508f904fd6eb848d640b5,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b667ffa06f591b7cb80508f904fd6eb848d640b5,Open Access Journal of Astronomy,Physics,2,e809f9540a9f373127f70881af62972b,10.23880/oaja-16000139,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

The core idea is to decompose multi-variable symbolic regression into a set of single-variable SR problems, which are then combined in a bottom-up manner. The proposed method involves a four-step process. First, we learn a data generator from observed data using deep neural networks (DNNs). Second, the data generator is used to generate samples for a certain variable by controlling the input variables. Thirdly, single-variable symbolic regression is applied to estimate the corresponding mathematical expression. Lastly, we repeat steps 2 and 3 by gradually adding variables one by one until completion. We evaluate the performance of our method on multiple benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ScaleSR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in discovering mathematical expressions with multiple variables.

Three mathematical models were evaluated with a genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal values for the kinetics constants. The Theil inequality coefficient (TIC) worked as a criterion to assess the models’ deviation. The diclofenac consumption followed a slow kinetic regime according to the Hatta number (Ha<0.3). However, it strongly contrasted with earlier studies. The obtained values for the volumetric rate of photon absorption (VRPA) corresponding to the PCOz process (1.75×10−6 & 6.54×10−7 Einstein L−1 min−1) were significantly distant from the maximum (2.59×10−5 Einstein L−1 min−1). The computed profiles of chemical species proved that no significant amount of hydroxyl radicals was produced in the Oz, whereas the PCOz achieved the highest production rate. According to this, titanium dioxide significantly contributed to ozone decomposition, especially at low ozone doses.

Existing knowledge-driven methods are time-consuming and need handcrafted parameters, while data-driven methods require large amounts of training resources and lack interpretability. What is more, most methods mainly focus on Gaussian noise rather than Poisson–Gaussian noise that matches better the real noise model. To address this issue, this letter proposes a multipriors-guided HSI noise removal method that not only combines the benefits of traditional methods and deep-learning methods, but also considers the Poisson–Gaussian-based mixed noise. Specifically, tensor subspace representation based on the guidance of the global spectral low-rank prior is employed to decompose the HSI into eigen-images and orthogonal spectral basis. Then a nonlocal–local-aware network (NLANe) that incorporates the guidance of local and nonlocal self-similarity priors is constructed to remove the noise in the eigen-images effectively and efficiently.

Brunius, Ann-Sofie Sandberg, R. Landberg, Mikael Wallman",2024,"Motivation In the field of precision nutrition, predicting metabolic response to diet and identifying groups of differential responders are two highly desirable steps toward developing tailored dietary strategies. However, data analysis tools are currently lacking, especially for complex settings such as crossover studies with repeated measures. Current methods of analysis often rely on matrix or tensor decompositions, which are well suited for identifying differential responders but lacking in predictive power, or on dynamical systems modeling, which may be used for prediction but typically requires detailed mechanistic knowledge of the system under study. To remedy these shortcomings, we explored dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is a recent, data-driven method for deriving low-rank linear dynamical systems from high dimensional data. Combining the two recent developments “parametric DMD” (pDMD) and “DMD with control” (DMDc) enabled us to (i) integrate multiple dietary challenges, (ii) predict the dynamic response in all measured metabolites to new diets from only the metabolite baseline and dietary input, and (iii) identify inter-individual metabolic differences, i.e., metabotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first time DMD has been applied to analyze time-resolved metabolomics data. Results We demonstrate the potential of pDMDc in a crossover study setting. We could predict the metabolite response to unseen dietary exposures on both measured (R2 = 0.40) and simulated data of increasing size (Rmax2= 0.65), as well as recover clusters of dynamic metabolite responses. We conclude that this method has potential for applications in personalized nutrition and could be useful in guiding metabolite response to target levels.

Spike",2024,"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a gene expression profiling technique that is presently revolutionizing the study of complex cellular systems in the biological sciences. Existing scRNA-seq methods suffer from sub-optimal target recovery leading to inaccurate measurements including many false negatives. The resulting ‘zero-inflated’ data may confound data interpretation and visualization. Since cells have coherent phenotypes defined by conserved molecular circuitries (i.e. multiple gene products working together) and since similar cells utilize similar circuits, information about each expression value or ‘node’ in a multi-cell, multi-gene scRNA-seq data set is expected to also be predictable from other nodes in the data set. Based on this logic, several approaches have been proposed to impute missing values in a data set by extracting information from its non-zero measurements. In this study, we apply non-negative matrix factorization to a selection of published scRNA-seq data sets followed by multiplication of the factor matrices to generate idealized ‘completed’ model versions of the data. From the model matrices, we recommend new values where original measurements are likely to be inaccurate and where ‘zero’ measurements are predicted to be false negatives. The resulting imputed data model predicts novel type markers and expression patterns that match orthogonal measurements and field literature better than those obtained from pre-imputation data or alternative imputation strategies.

Author summary In this work, we develop FIESTA, a novel, unsupervised, mathematical approach to impute missing values in scRNA-seq data. For each dataset, we use parts-based, non-negative matrix factorization to break the cells-by-genes expression matrix into optimized component matrices and then multiply these component matrices to generate an idealized, ‘completed’ matrix. The completed matrix has many of the null values filled in because the optimized low rank factors from which it is generated, take multiple cells into account when estimating a particular component, including some cells with positive expression values for genes which are false negatives in other related cells. We also implement scaling and thresholding approaches based on intrinsic data topology for improved interpretability and graphical representation. Overall, FIESTA performs favorably relative to alternative imputation approaches and uncovers gene-gene and gene-cell relationships that are occluded in the raw data.

Hernandez Bort, J. Zanghellini",2024,"Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) offer a holistic view of biochemical reaction networks, enabling in-depth analyses of metabolism across species and tissues in multiple conditions. However, comparing GSMMs against each other poses challenges as current dimensionality reduction algorithms or clustering methods lack mechanistic interpretability, and often rely on subjective assumptions. Here, we propose a new approach utilizing logisitic principal component analysis (LPCA) that efficiently clusters GSMMs while singling out mechanistic differences in terms of reactions and pathways that drive the categorization. We applied LPCA to multiple diverse datasets, including GSMMs of 222 Escherichia-strains, 343 budding yeasts (Saccharomycotina), 80 human tissues, and 2943 Firmicutes strains. Our findings demonstrate LPCA’s effectiveness in preserving microbial phylogenetic relationships and discerning human tissue-specific metabolic profiles, exhibiting comparable performance to traditional methods like t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and Jaccard coefficients. Moreover, the subsystems and associated reactions identified by LPCA align with existing knowledge, underscoring its reliability in dissecting GSMMs and uncovering the underlying drivers of separation.

Pan, Keunwan Park",2020,"As the microbiome is composed of a variety of microbial interactions, it is imperative in microbiome research to identify a microbial sub-community that collectively conducts a specific function. However, current methodologies have been highly limited to analyzing conditional abundance changes of individual microorganisms without considering group-wise collective microbial features. To overcome this limitation, we developed a network-based method using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify functional meta-microbial features (MMFs) that, as a group, better discriminate specific environmental conditions of samples using microbiome data. As proof of concept, large-scale human microbiome data collected from different body sites were used to identify body site-specific MMFs by applying NMF. The statistical test for MMFs led us to identify highly discriminative MMFs on sample classes, called synergistic MMFs (SYMMFs). Finally, we constructed a SYMMF-based microbial interaction network (SYMMF-net) by integrating all of the SYMMF information. Network analysis revealed core microbial modules closely related to critical sample properties. Similar results were also found when the method was applied to various disease-associated microbiome data.

Traditional GNMF methods typically rely on predefined graph structures to guide the decomposition process, using fixed data graphs and feature graphs to capture relationships between data points and features. However, these fixed graphs may limit the model’s expressiveness. Additionally, many NMF variants face challenges when dealing with complex data distributions and are vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method called sparse feature-weighted double Laplacian rank constraint non-negative matrix factorization (SFLRNMF), along with its extended version, SFLRNMTF. These methods adaptively construct more accurate data similarity and feature similarity graphs, while imposing rank constraints on the Laplacian matrices of these graphs. This rank constraint ensures that the resulting matrix ranks reflect the true number of clusters, thereby improving clustering performance. Moreover, we introduce a feature weighting matrix into the original data matrix to reduce the influence of irrelevant features and apply an L2,1/2 norm sparsity constraint in the basis matrix to encourage sparse representations. An orthogonal constraint is also enforced on the coefficient matrix to ensure interpretability of the dimensionality reduction results. In the extended model (SFLRNMTF), we introduce a double orthogonal constraint on the basis matrix and coefficient matrix to enhance the uniqueness and interpretability of the decomposition, thereby facilitating clearer clustering results for both rows and columns. However, enforcing double orthogonal constraints can reduce approximation accuracy, especially with low-rank matrices, as it restricts the model’s flexibility. To address this limitation, we introduce an additional factor matrix R, which acts as an adaptive component that balances the trade-off between constraint enforcement and approximation accuracy. This adjustment allows the model to achieve greater representational flexibility, improving reconstruction accuracy while preserving the interpretability and clustering clarity provided by the double orthogonality constraints. Consequently, the SFLRNMTF approach becomes more robust in capturing data patterns and achieving high-quality clustering results in complex datasets. We also propose an efficient alternating iterative update algorithm to optimize the proposed model and provide a theoretical analysis of its performance. Clustering results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms competing approaches.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9309b29ee46485087e0dab84263b23653b5810c0,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/23/3656/pdf?version=1732271009,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9309b29ee46485087e0dab84263b23653b5810c0,Mathematics,Computer Science,2,bfd64c316b3c547ddefea3aa94199142,10.3390/math12233656,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

For this purpose, a variety of classification algorithms are available which can be used to
automatically detect the desired information. K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation,
Gaussian Naïve Bayes and support Vector Classifier are some of the well known algorithms
used for the classification task. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization is a technique which has
gained a lot of popularity because of its nonnegativity constraints. This technique can be used for
better interpretability of data.



In this paper, we applied NMF as a pre-processing step for better results. We also evaluated
the given classifiers on the basis of four criteria: accuracy, precision, specificity and Recall.



The experimental results shows that these classifiers give better performance when
NMF is applied at pre-processing of data before giving it to the said classifiers. Gaussian Naïve Bias
algorithm showed a significant improvement in classification after the application of NMF at preprocessing.

Many different variants of the variational autoencoder have been applied, and have yielded superior results. However, because it is nonlinear, the model does not provide parameters that can be used to explain the underlying biological patterns. In this paper, we propose an interpretable nonnegative matrix factorization method that decomposes parameters into those shared across cells and those that are cell-specific. Effective nonlinear dimension reduction was achieved via a variational autoencoder applied to the cell-specific parameters. In addition to achieving nonlinear dimension reduction, our model could estimate the cell-type-specific gene expression.

At each scale, DADN uses a DAB to reassign the weights of feature maps on each channel and region to focus on useful information, which is beneficial for accurately extracting signal features and recovering deep-layer weak signals. The information flow undergoes downsampling and upsampling operations to finally achieve an accurate estimation of the DAS VSP signals. In addition, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is introduced to visually interpret the signal features learned by the network.

This paper combines adaptive dictionary learning with compressed sensing theory, first using input signal data for sparse coding, training adaptive dictionary to achieve rapid data compression, and finally using compressed sensing theory to reconstruct data.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ff0eb1e4746bb56487b1adff28a64490148b8e4,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ff0eb1e4746bb56487b1adff28a64490148b8e4,"2023 4th International Conference on Information Science, Parallel and Distributed Systems (ISPDS)","Engineering, Environmental Science, Computer Science",2,6444c75318e4f01c11f3b611a96a035a,10.1109/ISPDS58840.2023.10235564,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Haut, Rafael Pastor Vargas, Antonio J. Plaza",2023,"Deep learning-based anomaly detectors are receiving increasing attention, with the black box represented by neural networks being an ever-present puzzle. Recently, an interpretable deep network (LRR-Net) –the first model-driven deep network in the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection–provided an inspiring endeavor. However, this work is incomplete, as it separates dictionary construction from anomaly detection, leading to a mismatch problem. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep unrolling network with active dictionary learning, aiming to integrate dictionary construction into the network rather than two separate phases (one is a traditional method, and another is a deep learning method). Specifically, the approach incorporates the concept factorization (CF) theory into the design of an anomaly detection model based on low-rank representation, i.e., the dictionary is regarded as a linear combination of the original data and the coefficient matrix is constrained to be orthogonal. Furthermore, a deep unrolling network is designed to simulate the dictionary learning and variables updating process, achieving dictionary construction and anomaly detection. simultaneously. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed deep unrolling network achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c8ff500c2397ff7d4df4483b286df8870c079a2,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c8ff500c2397ff7d4df4483b286df8870c079a2,Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing,"Computer Science, Environmental Science, Computer Science, Engineering",2,a4adc689803abd2433f9adcedbdf79b1,10.1109/WHISPERS61460.2023.10431277,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Ba",2021,"Convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), the problem of estimating shift-invariant templates from data, is typically conducted in the absence of a prior/structure on the templates. In data-scarce or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, learned templates overfit the data and lack smoothness, which can affect the predictive performance of downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose GPCDL, a convolutional dictionary learning framework that enforces priors on templates using Gaussian Processes (GPs). With the focus on smoothness, we show theoretically that imposing a GP prior is equivalent to Wiener filtering the learned templates, thereby suppressing high-frequency components and promoting smoothness. We show that the algorithm is a simple extension of the classical iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, independent of the choice of GP kernels. This property allows one to experiment flexibly with different smoothness assumptions. Through simulation, we show that GPCDL learns smooth dictionaries with better accuracy than the unregularized alternative across a range of SNRs. Through an application to neural spiking data, we show that GPCDL learns a more accurate and visually-interpretable smooth dictionary, leading to superior predictive performance compared to non-regularized CDL, as well as parametric alternatives.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1027c6fe3eb5497cf943a4ae7f5f103699bb2250,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00530,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1027c6fe3eb5497cf943a4ae7f5f103699bb2250,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",2,ec1441dfc0e17e493ee48dd48f9954fe,10.1109/LSP.2021.3127471,2104.00530,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Among them, many modern data streams are represented as multidimensional arrays (aka tensors), and thus, streaming tensor decomposition or tensor tracking has become a promising tool to analyze such streaming data. In this paper, we propose a novel online algorithm called ROTDL for the problem of robust tensor tracking under the Tucker format. ROTDL is not only capable of tracking the underlying Tucker dictionary of multidimensional data streams over time, but also robust to sparse outliers. The proposed algorithm is specifically designed by using the alternating direction method of multipliers, block-coordinate descent, and recursive least-squares filtering techniques.

8c81bf4bb38175e49dee08dbc620fd909097afd8,Sparse Regularization Based on Orthogonal Tensor Dictionary Learning for Inverse Problems,Diriba Gemechu,2024,"In seismic data processing, data recovery including reconstruction of the missing trace and removal of noise from the recorded data are the key steps in improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The reconstruction of seismic data and removal of noise becomes a sparse optimization problem that can be solved by using sparse regularization. Sparse regularization is a key tool in the solution of inverse problems. They are used to introduce prior knowledge and make the approximation of ill-posed inverses feasible. It deals with ill-posedness by replacing an ill-posed inverse problem with a well-posed problem that has a solution close to the true solution. In the last 2 decades, interest has shifted from linear toward nonlinear regularization methods even for linear inverse problems. In inverse problems, regularizations serve as stabilizing the solution of ill-posed inverse problems and give a solution that adequately fits measurements without producing unjustifiably complex artifacts. In this paper, we present a novel sparse regularization based on a tensor-based dictionary method for inverse problems (seismic data interpolation and denoising). This regularization avoids the vectorization step for sparse representation of seismic data during the reconstruction process. The key step in sparsifying signals is the choice of sparsity-promoting dictionary learning. The learning-based approach can adaptively sparsify datasets but has high computational complexity and involves no prior-constraint pattern information for the dataset. Many existing dictionary learning methods would be computationally infeasible for the high dimensional seismic data processing. These methods also destroy the essential information as well as it reduces the discriminability and expressibility of the signal, since they deal with vectorization. In this paper, the orthogonal tensor dictionary learning that learns a dictionary from the input data by employing orthogonality and separability is proposed as sparse regularization for the inverse problems. The performance of the proposed method was validated in seismic data interpolation and denoising individually as well as simultaneously. Numerical examples of synthetic and real seismic datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The SNR of the recovered data confirms that the proposed method is the most effective method than K-singular value decomposition and orthogonal dictionary learning methods.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c81bf4bb38175e49dee08dbc620fd909097afd8,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2024/9655008.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c81bf4bb38175e49dee08dbc620fd909097afd8,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,"Engineering, Geology",2,60cbdfed39fa4b81819fc2d9ab99d5ec,10.1155/2024/9655008,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Geology'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Zeng, Jiarui Sun, Xin Xu, Yikui Zhang",2023,"Data reconstruction and data denoising are two critical preliminary steps in seismic data processing. Compressed Sensing states that a signal can be recovered by a series of solving algorithms if it is sparse in a transform domain, and has been well applied in the field of reconstruction, when, sparse representation of seismic data is the key point. Considering the complexity and diversity of seismic data, a single mathematical transformation will lead to incomplete sparse expression and bad restoration effects. Morphological Component Analysis (MCA) decomposes a signal into several components with outstanding morphological features to approximate the complex internal data structure. However, the representation ability of combined dictionaries is constrained by the number of dictionaries, and cannot be self-adaptively matched with the data features. Dictionary learning overcomes the limitation of fixed base function by training dictionaries that are fully suitable for processed data, but requires huge amount of time and considerable hardware cost. To solve the above problems, a new dictionary library (K-Singluar Value Decomposition learning dictionary and Discrete Cosine Transform dictionary) is hereby proposed based on the efficiency of fixed base dictionary and the high precision of learning dictionary. The self-adaptive sparse representation is achieved under the Morphological Component Analysis framework and is successfully applied to the reconstruction and denoising of seismic data.

Schnabel",2021,"We analyze vibration signals from wind turbines with dictionary learning and investigate the relation between dictionary distances and faults occurring in a wind turbine output shaft rolling element bearing and gearbox under different data and compute constraints. Dictionary learning is an unsupervised machine learning method for signal processing, which permits learning a set of signal-specific features that have been used to monitor the condition of rotating machines, including wind turbines. Dictionary distance is one such feature, and its effectiveness depends on an adequate selection of the dictionary learning hyperparameters and the data availability, which typically is constrained in condition monitoring systems for remotely located wind farms. Here we evaluate the characteristics of the dictionary distance feature under healthy and faulty conditions of the wind turbines using different options for the selection of the pretrained dictionary, the sparsity of the signal model which determines the compute requirements, and the interval between data samples. Furthermore, we compare the dictionary distance feature to the typical time-domain features used in condition monitoring. We find that the dictionary distance based feature of a faulty wind turbine deviates by a factor of two or more from the population distribution several weeks before the gearbox bearing fault was reported, using a data sampling interval as long as 24 h and a model sparsity as low as 2.5%.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67c1f494317303b0c658536a14401e00ee346e94,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67c1f494317303b0c658536a14401e00ee346e94,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Temporal coding represents activations in an artificial neural network (ANN) as binary signaling events in time, thereby minimizing circuit activity. Discrepancies in numeric results are inherent to common conversion schemes, as the atomic computing unit, i.e. the neuron, performs algorithmically different operations and, thus, potentially degrading SNN's quality of service (QoS). In this work, a lossless conversion method is derived in a top-down design approach for continuous time signals using electrocardiogram (ECG) classification as an example. As a result, the converted SNN achieves identical results compared to its fixed-point ANN reference. The computations, implied by proposed method, result in a novel hybrid neuron model located in between the integrate-and-fire (IF) and conventional ANN neuron, which numerical result is equivalent to the latter. Additionally, a dedicated SNN accelerator is implemented in 22 nm FDSOI CMOS suitable for continuous real-time classification.

In this study, heartbeat signals are modelled by CSC and recovered by exploiting the sparsity of the signal. GMM is introduced to model the unknown noise, which could be a mixture from multiple noise/interference sources. The parameters of GMM , dictionary and codes are computed via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.

Sompolinsky",2022,"A central question in computational neuroscience is how structure determines function in neural networks. The emerging high-quality large-scale connectomic datasets raise the question of what general functional principles can be gleaned from structural information such as the distribution of excitatory/inhibitory synapse types and the distribution of synaptic weights. Motivated by this question, we developed a statistical mechanical theory of learning in neural networks that incorporates structural information as constraints. We derived an analytical solution for the memory capacity of the perceptron, a basic feedforward model of supervised learning, with constraint on the distribution of its weights. Our theory predicts that the reduction in capacity due to the constrained weight-distribution is related to the Wasserstein distance between the imposed distribution and that of the standard normal distribution. To test the theoretical predictions, we use optimal transport theory and information geometry to develop an SGD-based algorithm to find weights that simultaneously learn the input-output task and satisfy the distribution constraint. We show that training in our algorithm can be interpreted as geodesic flows in the Wasserstein space of probability distributions. We further developed a statistical mechanical theory for teacher-student perceptron rule learning and ask for the best way for the student to incorporate prior knowledge of the rule. Our theory shows that it is beneficial for the learner to adopt different prior weight distributions during learning, and shows that distribution-constrained learning outperforms unconstrained and sign-constrained learning. Our theory and algorithm provide novel strategies for incorporating prior knowledge about weights into learning, and reveal a powerful connection between structure and function in neural networks.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c5c187d82b62a2bcb62d7a9d76316ba04b22002,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08933,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c5c187d82b62a2bcb62d7a9d76316ba04b22002,arXiv.org,"Biology, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",2,b1016d7085806245b4e6b84b6ff12aae,10.48550/arXiv.2206.08933,2206.08933,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00
de6bd49ecbffe5911e826e455fc0ca821e315f64,Deciphering the genetic code of neuronal type connectivity through bilinear modeling,Mu Qiao,2024,"Understanding how different neuronal types connect and communicate is critical to interpreting brain function and behavior. However, it has remained a formidable challenge to decipher the genetic underpinnings that dictate the specific connections formed between neuronal types. To address this, we propose a novel bilinear modeling approach that leverages the architecture similar to that of recommendation systems. Our model transforms the gene expressions of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal types, obtained from single-cell transcriptomics, into a covariance matrix. The objective is to construct this covariance matrix that closely mirrors a connectivity matrix, derived from connectomic data, reflecting the known anatomical connections between these neuronal types. When tested on a dataset of Caenorhabditis elegans, our model achieved a performance comparable to, if slightly better than, the previously proposed spatial connectome model (SCM) in reconstructing electrical synaptic connectivity based on gene expressions. Through a comparative analysis, our model not only captured all genetic interactions identified by the SCM but also inferred additional ones. Applied to a mouse retinal neuronal dataset, the bilinear model successfully recapitulated recognized connectivity motifs between bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells, and provided interpretable insights into genetic interactions shaping the connectivity. Specifically, it identified unique genetic signatures associated with different connectivity motifs, including genes important to cell-cell adhesion and synapse formation, highlighting their role in orchestrating specific synaptic connections between these neurons. Our work establishes an innovative computational strategy for decoding the genetic programming of neuronal type connectivity. It not only sets a new benchmark for single-cell transcriptomic analysis of synaptic connections but also paves the way for mechanistic studies of neural circuit assembly and genetic manipulation of circuit wiring.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de6bd49ecbffe5911e826e455fc0ca821e315f64,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.91532,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de6bd49ecbffe5911e826e455fc0ca821e315f64,bioRxiv,"Biology, Medicine, Computer Science, Biology",2,13ababc3f8d11e3b69f8fe271e7a5f2a,10.1101/2023.08.01.551532,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00
fad85124f4c726bedd46503e48142d1f2d3ac45a,Saying goodbye to an unwelcome guest: towards robust methods for controlling multi‐sensory confounds in TMS‐EEG research,A. Hill,2023,"Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is a multi-modal functional neuroimaging approach that has seen growing uptake across basic, cognitive, and clinical neuroscience as a method for safely interrogating cortical physiology in vivo. TMS uses a coil placed over the scalp to produce a brief, time-varying magnetic field capable of passing unimpeded through the skull to activate underlying neuronal populations (Barker et al., 1985). By combining TMS with EEG, the electrical neuronal response to stimulation can be captured across the cortex with millisecond temporal precision, providing insight into brain responsivity both at the stimulation site and across broader neural networks (Tremblay et al., 2019). As such, TMS-EEG has opened exciting new avenues for understanding healthy brain function and probing neuropathophysiological circuits across several psychiatric, neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, in addition to transcranially stimulating cortical neuronal populations, TMS also exerts effects on brain function via indirect multi-sensory pathways. This includes activation of the auditory system through the ‘click’ sound generated when the TMS coil discharges, as well as via signal propagation through somatosensory pathways caused by stimulation of the scalp and vibration of the TMS coil. These sensory co-activations lead to peripherally evoked potentials (PEPs) on the EEG record, which, if not adequately accounted for, can obscure the TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) arising from direct transcranial stimulation of the cortex. In this issue of The Journal of Physiology, Gordon et al. (2023) report results from a study aimed at better understanding TEPs and PEPs captured with TMS-EEG. To achieve their aim, the authors used an experimental approach incorporating both an optimised sham TMS protocol and pharmacological challenge. Healthy participants completed two experimental sessions during which TMS-EEG recordings were obtained both before and after administration of either a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (oral diazepam) or placebo. This pharmaco-TMS-EEG design enabled the authors to investigate changes in brain responses to a drug previously shown to alter cortical reactivity using TMS-EEG (Premoli et al., 2014). Gordon et al. (2023) implement a unique stimulation approach targeting motor cortex that interleaved active and sham stimulation within the same experimental block along with concomitant high-intensity electrical stimulation of the scalp. This sophisticated methodology enabled the authors to closely align the auditory and somatosensory inputs generated across these two conditions. There are, nevertheless, some potential caveats surrounding this approach. For instance, the use of electrical stimulation in close proximity to recording electrodes will unavoidably produce artifacts on the EEG trace – a limitation the authors themselves acknowledge. If not completely removed, this could distort or obscure TEPs, particularly at early time points. Also, given that the authors used high electrical stimulation intensities (average= 25.6 mA) to saturate the PEPs in both the active and sham TMS conditions, this raises interesting questions regarding intensities at which these might begin to induce meaningful physiological effects in the brain via injection of current through the scalp and skull. Although this is perhaps unlikely, given that the E-field induced in the brain would be diminished manyfold in comparison to TMS, it could be a potentially interesting avenue to explore in future research. A central finding by Gordon et al. (2023) was that modulation of GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission via diazepam was able to elicit demonstrable changes on the TMS-EEG record following both active and sham TMS. Specifically, diazepam attenuated late responses in both the active (>80 ms) and sham (>85 ms) conditions, while also enhancing the negativity of the P60 potential in the active TMS condition only. This indicates that cortical reactivity to both direct transcranial stimulation and sensory co-activation can be pharmacologically modulated. A further particularly interesting discovery relates to the N100 response. This prominent negative potential has been previously linked to cortical inhibitory processes, including by pharmaco-TMS-EEG studies using GABA receptor agonists (Premoli et al., 2014). However, the N100 is also sensitive to multi-sensory input (Biabani et al., 2019). The results of Gordon et al. (2023) indicate that although diazepam was able to attenuate the N100 amplitude in both the active and sham TMS conditions, after subtracting the sham from the active TMS response this effect disappeared. This raises the intriguing possibility that GABAA receptor-mediated modulation of the N100 via diazepam could in fact be driven by PEPs. The potential significance of this observation is substantial given that the N100 is frequently interpreted as reflecting cortical inhibition in motor cortex. Research is needed to assess the replicability of this result and would likely also benefit from the inclusion of a drug targeting GABAB receptors, given past links between the N100 and GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition (Tremblay et al., 2019). In summary, this timely study by Gordon et al. (2023) significantly contributes to ongoing endeavours to advance mechanistic understanding of neural responses captured using TMS-EEG. The findings corroborate growing evidence supporting the need for adequate control of PEPs on the TMS-EEG record, particularly when analysing later-occurring responses (i.e. >∼80 ms post-TMS). Thus, while continued empirical efforts will no doubt be required to further fine-tune best-practice",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fad85124f4c726bedd46503e48142d1f2d3ac45a,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1113/JP284727,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fad85124f4c726bedd46503e48142d1f2d3ac45a,Journal of Physiology,"Medicine, Engineering",2,d417b67ce8f3eb15fccf33b13bd5c989,10.1113/JP284727,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Numerous interpretability methods have been developed to attribute model behavior to three key aspects: input features, training data, and internal model components, which emerged from explainable AI, data-centric AI, and mechanistic interpretability, respectively. However, these attribution methods are studied and applied rather independently, resulting in a fragmented landscape of methods and terminology. This position paper argues that feature, data, and component attribution methods share fundamental similarities, and a unified view of them benefits both interpretability and broader AI research. To this end, we first analyze popular methods for these three types of attributions and present a unified view demonstrating that these seemingly distinct methods employ similar techniques (such as perturbations, gradients, and linear approximations) over different aspects and thus differ primarily in their perspectives rather than techniques. Then, we demonstrate how this unified view enhances understanding of existing attribution methods, highlights shared concepts and evaluation criteria among these methods, and leads to new research directions both in interpretability research, by addressing common challenges and facilitating cross-attribution innovation, and in AI more broadly, with applications in model editing, steering, and regulation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3eaacb86487b8e6038bf4ed21110a5c4ae2e8f55,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18887.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3eaacb86487b8e6038bf4ed21110a5c4ae2e8f55,,"Computer Science, Computer Science",2,ec1f53088dc7ae6d2e112d02afd552be,,2501.18887,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00

Shavit",2025,"We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable. We show how to decipher these computations by analyzing a network's feature channel coding, offering complete mechanistic interpretations of several small neural networks that were trained with gradient descent. Crucially, this is achieved via static combinatorial analysis of the weight matrices, without examining activations or training new autoencoding networks. Feature channel coding reframes the superposition hypothesis, shifting the focus from neuron activation directionality in high-dimensional space to the combinatorial structure of codes. It also allows us for the first time to exactly quantify and explain the relationship between a network's parameter size and its computational capacity (i.e. the set of features it can compute with low error), a relationship that is implicitly at the core of many modern scaling laws. Though our initial studies of feature channel coding are restricted to Boolean functions, we believe they provide a rich, controlled, and informative research space, and that the path we propose for combinatorial interpretation of neural computation can provide a basis for understanding both artificial and biological neural circuits.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82642b3045357adf0b49575d95ca91e1a01494cf,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08842.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82642b3045357adf0b49575d95ca91e1a01494cf,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science",2,7b92d98ff83a4f52e3ade276049314d3,10.48550/arXiv.2504.08842,2504.08842,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:34.894843+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:34.894843+00:00

However, their intrinsic complexity and lack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly regulated financial sector, where interpretability, fairness, and accountability are critical. As far as we are aware, this paper presents the first application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the inner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the pressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic interpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM behavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the activations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how specific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not only to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore the theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its practical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments, including applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and hallucination detection. While not yet widely adopted, mechanistic interpretability is expected to become increasingly vital as adoption of LLMs increases. Advanced interpretability tools can ensure AI systems remain ethical, transparent, and aligned with evolving financial regulations.

We find that activations of individual RS units exhibit strong continuity across layers, despite the RS being a non-privileged basis. Activations in the RS accelerate and grow denser over layers, while individual units trace unstable periodic orbits. In reduced-dimensional spaces, the RS follows a curved trajectory with attractor-like dynamics in the lower layers.

We systematically apply unstructured and structured pruning, as well as connection sparsity (pruning of input weights) methods to the network and analyze the outcomes regarding the network's performance on the validation set of ImageNet. We also compare different retraining strategies, such as iterative pruning and one-shot pruning. We find that with sufficient retraining epochs, the performance of the networks can approximate the performance of the default GoogLeNet - and even surpass it in some cases. To assess interpretability, we employ the Mechanistic Interpretability Score (MIS) developed by Zimmermann et al. . Our experiments reveal that there is no significant relationship between interpretability and pruning rate when using MIS as a measure.

Through extensive empirical experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis, we demystify the emergence of elegant attention patterns: a diagonal and homogeneous pattern in the key-query (KQ) weights, and a last-entry-only and zero-sum pattern in the output-value (OV) weights. Remarkably, these patterns consistently appear from gradient-based training starting from random initialization. Our analysis reveals that such emergent structures enable multi-head attention to approximately implement a debiased gradient descent predictor -- one that outperforms single-head attention and nearly achieves Bayesian optimality up to proportional factor. Furthermore, compared to linear transformers, the softmax attention readily generalizes to sequences longer than those seen during training. We also extend our study to scenarios with anisotropic covariates and multi-task linear regression. In the former, multi-head attention learns to implement a form of pre-conditioned gradient descent. In the latter, we uncover an intriguing regime where the interplay between head number and task number triggers a superposition phenomenon that efficiently resolves multi-task in-context learning.

Using activation patching techniques, we analyze the roles of various model components and identify a multi-stage, progressive process in generating either pointwise or pairwise relevance judgment. Specifically, LLMs first extract query and document information in the early layers, then process relevance information according to instructions in the middle layers, and finally utilize specific attention heads in the later layers to generate relevance judgments in the required format.

An Analysis of Non-truthful Reporting,"Emil Chrisander, Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen",2023,"A core aspect in market design is to encourage participants to truthfully report their preferences to ensure efficiency and fairness. Our research paper analyzes the factors that contribute to and the consequences of students reporting non-truthfully in admissions applications. We survey college applicants in Denmark about their perceptions of the admission process and personality to examine recent theories of misreporting preferences. Our analysis reveals that omissions in reports are largely driven by students' pessimistic beliefs about their chances of admission. Moreover, such erroneous beliefs largely account for whether an omission led to a missed opportunity for admission. However, the low frequency of these errors suggests that most non-truthful reports are""white lies""with minimal negative impact. We find a novel role of personality and individual circumstances that co-determine the extent of omissions. We also find that estimates of students' demand are biased if it is assumed that students report truthfully, and demonstrate that this bias can be reduced by making a less restrictive assumption.

This setting can be applied in distributed multi-processor computing environments and also in operations research. In this paper, we study the design of randomized decentralized mechanism in the setting where a set of non-preemptive jobs select randomly a machine from a set of uniform machines to be processed on, and each machine can process at most one job at a time. We introduce a new concept of myopic Bayes–Nash incentive compatibility which weakens the classical Bayes–Nash incentive compatibility and derive a randomized decentralized mechanism under the assumption that each job is a rational and selfish agent. We show that our mechanism can induce jobs to report truthfully their private information referred to myopic Bayes–Nash implementability by using a graph theoretic interpretation of the incentive compatibility constraints. Furthermore, we prove that the performance of this mechanism is asymptotically optimal.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23f8cac93599369830ecd3e5463ae0c630dda1f0,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23f8cac93599369830ecd3e5463ae0c630dda1f0,Optim.

In the consumer surplus maximization problem, a seller with a set of goods faces a set of strategic buyers with private values, each of whom aims to maximize their own individual utility. The seller, in contrast, aims to allocate the goods in a way that maximizes the total buyer utility. The seller must then elicit the values of the buyers in order to decide what goods to award each buyer. The canonical approach in mechanism design to ensure truthful reporting of the private information is to find appropriate prices to charge each buyer in order to align their objective with the objective of the seller. Indeed, there are many celebrated results to this end when the seller’s objective is welfare maximization or revenue maximization. However, in the case of consumer surplus maximization the picture is less clear – using high payments to ensure the highest value bidders are served necessarily decreases their surplus utility, but using low payments may lead the seller into serving lower value bidders. Our main result in this paper is a framework for designing mechanisms that maximize consumer surplus. We instantiate our framework in a variety of canonical multi-parameter auction settings (i.e., unit-demand bidders with heterogeneous items, multi-unit auctions, and auctions with divisible goods) and use it to design auctions achieving consumer surplus with tight approximation guarantees against the total social welfare. Along the way, we resolve an open question posed by Hartline and Roughgarden [STOC 2008] for the two bidders single item setting.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0757d777f48dfa3db3e71f672482290d8d9bd7c2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16972.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0757d777f48dfa3db3e71f672482290d8d9bd7c2,Symposium on the Theory of Computing,"Computer Science, Economics",1,23faae0b20d9f0b9329789a570b01798,10.1145/3717823.3718126,2402.16972,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Konstantinou, Dimitris Fotakis, N. Koziris",2021,"Modern large-scale computing deployments consist of complex elastic applications running over machine clusters. A current trend adopted by providers is to set unused virtual machines, or else spot instances, in low prices to take advantage of spare capacity. In this paper we present a group of efficient allocation and pricing policies that can be used by vendors for their spot price mechanisms. We model the procedure of acquiring virtual machines as a truthful knapsack auction and we deploy dynamic allocation and pricing rules that achieve near-optimal revenue and social welfare. As the problem is NP-hard our solutions are based on approximate algorithms. First, we propose two solutions that do not use prior knowledge. Then, we enhance them with three learning algorithms. We evaluate them with simulations on the Google Cluster dataset and we benchmark them against the Uniform Price, the Optimal Single Price and the Ex-CORE mechanisms.

5dc8ae69bd0f8560275a6334ec4fcf037773c147,Ethical Leadership and Financial Reporting Practices in Chad,Yaya Gamba,2024,"Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess the ethical leadership and financial reporting practices in Chad. 
Methodology: This study adopted a desk methodology. A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries. 
Findings: The study indicated that when leaders prioritize ethical conduct and integrity, it positively influences how financial information is reported and communicated to stakeholders. Ethical leaders foster a culture of transparency, accountability, and honesty, which leads to more accurate and reliable financial reporting. This, in turn, enhances investor confidence, reduces the risk of financial fraud, and promotes long-term sustainability for the organization. Studies also highlight the importance of ethical leadership in regulatory compliance, as leaders who prioritize ethics are more likely to ensure that financial reporting practices adhere to legal and ethical standards. Overall, the link between ethical leadership and financial reporting practices underscores the significant impact that leaders have on the integrity and credibility of financial information within companies.  
Implications to Theory, Practice and Policy: Transformational leadership theory, stakeholder theory and agency theory may be used to anchor future studies on assessing the ethical leadership and financial reporting practices in Chad. Organizations should implement comprehensive ethics training programs for leaders and employees to enhance ethical awareness, decision-making, and behavior related to financial reporting. Policymakers and regulators should strengthen regulatory oversight and enforcement mechanisms related to financial reporting practices.       ",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5dc8ae69bd0f8560275a6334ec4fcf037773c147,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5dc8ae69bd0f8560275a6334ec4fcf037773c147,American Journal of Accounting,Business,1,037ee3a8680cc93dbff179cd1f143f64,10.47672/ajacc.2165,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Business'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

We consider an information update system in which a destination acquires, and pays for, fresh data updates from a source. The destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general increasing function of the age-of-information (AoI). The source is strategic and incurs a sampling cost, which is its private information and may not be truthfully reported to the destination. To this end, we design an optimal (economic) mechanism for timely information acquisition by generalizing Myerson's seminal work. The goal is to minimize the sum of the destination's age-related cost and its payment to the source, while ensuring that the source truthfully reports its private information and will voluntarily participate in the mechanism. Our results show that, under some distributions of the source's cost, our proposed optimal mechanism can lead to an unbounded benefit, compared against a benchmark that naively trusts the source's report and thus incentivizes its maximal over-reporting.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d81d6292a5e89f325314702490a0d51fe26f2f9d,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d81d6292a5e89f325314702490a0d51fe26f2f9d,International Symposium on Information Theory,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",1,4c03d8f248db62d92fa829056965ca9b,10.1109/ISIT45174.2021.9517951,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Rotello, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy",2025,"As large language models increasingly rely on external data sources, compensating data contributors has become a central concern. But how should these payments be devised? We revisit data valuations from a $\textit{market-design perspective}$ where payments serve to compensate data owners for the $\textit{private}$ heterogeneous costs they incur for collecting and sharing data. We show that popular valuation methods-such as Leave-One-Out and Data Shapley-make for poor payments. They fail to ensure truthful reporting of the costs, leading to $\textit{inefficient market}$ outcomes. To address this, we adapt well-established payment rules from mechanism design, namely Myerson and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG), to the data market setting. We show that Myerson payment is the minimal truthful mechanism, optimal from the buyer's perspective. Additionally, we identify a condition under which both data buyers and sellers are utility-satisfied, and the market achieves efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating incentive compatibility into data valuation design, paving the way for more robust and efficient data markets.

Wilson",2024,"Incentive compatibility is core to mechanism design. The success of auctions, matching algorithms, and voting systems all hinge on the ability to select incentives that make it in the individual’s interest to reveal their type. But how do we test whether a mechanism that is designed to be incentive compatible is actually so in practice, particularly when faced with boundedly rational agents with nonstandard preferences? We review the many experimental tests that have been designed to assess behavioral incentive compatibility, separating them into two categories: indirect tests that evaluate behavior within the mechanism, and direct tests that assess how participants respond to the mechanism’s incentives. Using belief elicitation as a running example, we show that the most popular elicitations are not behaviorally incentive compatible.

It combines the flexibility of deep learning with a regret-based approach to relax incentive compatibility, allowing for approximations of revenue-maximizing auctions. However, applying these techniques to combinatorial auctions (CAs) - where bidders value bundles rather than individual items, capturing item interdependencies - remains a challenge, primarily due to the lack of methodologies that can effectively deal with combinatorial constraints. To tackle this, we propose two architectures: CANet, a fully connected neural network, and CAFormer, a transformer-based model designed to learn optimal randomized mechanisms. Unlike existing methods in traditional AMD, our approach is more scalable and free of assumptions about the structures of allowable bundles or bidder valuations. We demonstrate that our models match current methods in non-combinatorial settings and set new benchmarks for CAs. Specifically, our models consistently outperform benchmark mechanisms derived from heuristic approaches and provide empirical solutions where analytical results are unavailable.

Peeters",2024,": Reusing real-world health data is useful, but challenging. Multiple initiatives exist and more are continuously arising to overcome these challenges, but the strategic oversight across these initiatives is lacking, which leads to a fragmented ecosystem. An overview of which initiatives that work on unlocking real-world health data, making this data accessible for research and/or innovation and/or policy and getting an idea about which aspect of the ecosystem the initiatives are working on would be very helpful. It could help in figuring out how initiatives can work in synergy in order that consortia can be formed more efficiently. We tried to create an overview, resulting in a static list, but have thereby run into many problems and difficulties and have noticed that the information is even more scattered than expected, and often ambiguous and unclear. This paper highlights the need for strategic oversight in our complex health data space, defines key challenges and focuses on solutions and strategies for overcoming these challenges, and aims to guide the future of health data research and innovation on a global scale, offering a valuable resource for stakeholders in the field.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2161e525183a039ecf208cd2e6208ac8208495cb,https://doi.org/10.5220/0012417700003657,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2161e525183a039ecf208cd2e6208ac8208495cb,International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies,"Computer Science, Medicine, Environmental Science",1,e65fd0a20c2706c8736a8464eca2c41c,10.5220/0012417700003657,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00
0c87ed231edc4429d964f8806fec793995fd3073,Bridging Human Oversight and Black-box Driver Assistance: Vision-Language Models for Predictive Alerting in Lane Keeping Assist Systems,"Yuhang Wang, Hao Zhou",2025,"Lane Keeping Assist systems, while increasingly prevalent, often suffer from unpredictable real-world failures, largely due to their opaque, black-box nature, which limits driver anticipation and trust. To bridge the gap between automated assistance and effective human oversight, we present LKAlert, a novel supervisory alert system that leverages VLM to forecast potential LKA risk 1-3 seconds in advance. LKAlert processes dash-cam video and CAN data, integrating surrogate lane segmentation features from a parallel interpretable model as automated guiding attention. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, LKAlert issues both predictive alert and concise natural language explanation, enhancing driver situational awareness and trust. To support the development and evaluation of such systems, we introduce OpenLKA-Alert, the first benchmark dataset designed for predictive and explainable LKA failure warnings. It contains synchronized multimodal inputs and human-authored justifications across annotated temporal windows. We further contribute a generalizable methodological framework for VLM-based black-box behavior prediction, combining surrogate feature guidance with LoRA. This framework enables VLM to reason over structured visual context without altering its vision backbone, making it broadly applicable to other complex, opaque systems requiring interpretable oversight. Empirical results correctly predicts upcoming LKA failures with 69.8% accuracy and a 58.6\% F1-score. The system also generates high-quality textual explanations for drivers (71.7 ROUGE-L) and operates efficiently at approximately 2 Hz, confirming its suitability for real-time, in-vehicle use. Our findings establish LKAlert as a practical solution for enhancing the safety and usability of current ADAS and offer a scalable paradigm for applying VLMs to human-centered supervision of black-box automation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c87ed231edc4429d964f8806fec793995fd3073,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11535.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c87ed231edc4429d964f8806fec793995fd3073,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Engineering",1,7b396db2a12089910a18f6cd18eb14c3,10.48550/arXiv.2505.11535,2505.11535,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

This paper explores the design and implementation of automated content moderation systems that leverage advanced technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and machine learning. These systems aim to detect, analyze, and mitigate harmful content, including hate speech, misinformation, and explicit material, in real time. 
Key challenges addressed include achieving accuracy in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, minimizing false positives and negatives, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical guidelines. A hybrid moderation framework combining automated algorithms and human oversight is proposed to balance efficiency with contextual understanding. Advanced NLP models, such as transformer-based architectures, are utilized for text analysis, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed for image and video content assessment. Real-world applications, such as flagging inappropriate posts, restricting access to harmful media, and managing user reports, are examined to highlight the system's efficacy. 
Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of transparency, user privacy, and bias mitigation in designing these systems. Case studies from leading social media platforms illustrate the impact of automated moderation on reducing harmful content and fostering healthier online communities.

This paper conducts a comparative analysis of AI risk management strategies across the European Union (EU), United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (UK), and China. A multi-method qualitative approach, including comparative policy analysis, thematic analysis, and case studies, investigates how these regions classify AI risks, implement compliance measures, structure oversight, prioritize transparency, and respond to emerging innovations. Examples from high-risk contexts like healthcare diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, fintech, and facial recognition demonstrate the advantages and limitations of different regulatory models. The findings show that the EU implements a structured, risk-based framework that prioritizes transparency and conformity assessments, while the U.S. uses decentralized, sector-specific regulations that promote innovation but may lead to fragmented enforcement. The flexible, sector-specific strategy of the UK facilitates agile responses but may lead to inconsistent coverage across domains. China's centralized directives allow rapid large-scale implementation while constraining public transparency and external oversight.

Existing methods for detecting and preventing fraud often rely on reactive approaches, leaving organizations vulnerable to sophisticated schemes. This study proposes an AI-Enhanced Fraud Detection and Prevention Model (AI-FDPM), a real-time framework designed to monitor, detect, and prevent financial irregularities in bank reconciliation and transaction oversight processes. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and anomaly detection algorithms, the model ensures heightened accuracy and responsiveness in identifying fraudulent activities. The AI-FDPM employs a layered architecture that integrates data preprocessing, pattern recognition, and predictive analytics to identify anomalies in transaction data. Machine learning algorithms are trained on historical transaction datasets to recognize fraudulent patterns while continuously adapting to emerging threats. Additionally, the framework incorporates NLP for processing unstructured financial data, enabling the detection of inconsistencies in transaction narratives and supporting documentation. Real-time monitoring and alert systems further enhance the model's capabilities by providing proactive fraud prevention measures. Key findings demonstrate that the AI-FDPM significantly reduces financial discrepancies and improves reconciliation accuracy by up to 85%, while enabling timely intervention in high-risk scenarios. The model also supports scalability and adaptability, allowing financial institutions to handle increasing transaction volumes without compromising oversight quality. A case study analysis highlights successful implementations in mitigating fraud within banking systems, emphasizing the model's effectiveness and cost-efficiency. This research provides a transformative approach to fraud detection and prevention, addressing critical gaps in traditional methods. The AI-FDPM framework offers financial institutions a robust, scalable, and intelligent solution to enhance financial security and operational reliability.

We explore the accuracy of such systems in the context of higher education by predicting degree completion before admission, with potential applications for prioritizing admissions decisions. Using a large-scale dataset from Danish higher education admissions, we demonstrate that advanced sequential AI models offer more precise and fair predictions compared to current practices that rely on either high school grade point averages or human judgment. These models not only improve accuracy but also outperform simpler models, even when the simpler models use protected sociodemographic attributes. Importantly, our predictions reveal how certain student profiles are better matched with specific programs and fields, suggesting potential efficiency and welfare gains in public policy. We estimate that even the use of simple AI models to guide admissions decisions, particularly in response to a newly implemented nationwide policy reducing admissions by 10 percent, could yield significant economic benefits.

Baek, Subhash Kantamneni, Max Tegmark",2025,"Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger ones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent systems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code and Wargames. For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on general AI system capability. We then build on our findings in a theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. We also apply our theory to our four oversight games, where we find that NSO success rates at a general Elo gap of 400 are 13.5% for Mafia, 51.7% for Debate, 10.0% for Backdoor Code, and 9.4% for Wargames; these rates decline further when overseeing stronger systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b06a38a1d5166fb5931aa7f5c0b7e2198689aad1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18530.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b06a38a1d5166fb5931aa7f5c0b7e2198689aad1,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science",1,d70f3656a8c835f79ebeb679ee3267d7,10.48550/arXiv.2504.18530,2504.18530,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Choate, Laura Burke, Yasmine Ali",2024,"The COVID-19 pandemic caught the world unprepared. Large-scale testing efforts were urgently needed, and diagnostic strategies had to rapidly evolve in response to unprecedented worldwide demand. However, the rollout of diagnostic testing and screening for SARS-CoV-2 was often impeded by logistical challenges, including regulatory delays, workforce shortages, laboratory bottlenecks, and supply chain disruptions. Recognizing these hurdles early on, we developed a testing approach that supported frequent, repeat testing, particularly as communities reopened. We hypothesized and experimentally demonstrated that saliva was a suitable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. This finding was advanced into the development of open-source, extraction-free reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction protocols using readily available, “off-the-shelf” reagents and equipment for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva (“SalivaDirect’’). Working with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we established a novel regulatory framework wherein the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization to Yale University to offer the SalivaDirect test protocol to high-complexity diagnostic laboratories (as designated by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) with quality oversight provided by Yale. This grew into a network of more than 200 labs across the United States that, as of May 2024, resulted in over 6.5 million SARS-CoV-2 tests. By making the protocol flexible and open-source, laboratories were able to rapidly and economically scale testing using a simple, self-collected saliva specimen. Additionally, fostering a national network of laboratories enabled real-time exchanges, problem solving, and the development of community best practices.

This study examines the biases and limitations of LLMs in three roles: answer generator, judge, and debater. These roles loosely correspond to previously described alignment frameworks: preference alignment (judge) and scalable oversight (debater), with the answer generator reflecting the typical setting with user interactions. We develop a ``no-consensus'' benchmark by curating examples that encompass a variety of a priori ambivalent scenarios, each presenting two possible stances. Our results show that while LLMs can provide nuanced assessments when generating open-ended answers, they tend to take a stance on no-consensus topics when employed as judges or debaters. These findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated methods for aligning LLMs without human oversight, highlighting that LLMs cannot fully capture human disagreement even on topics where humans themselves are divided.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35adb11b185a22cdbc608c6823dd1744dd7f4c4f,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23820.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35adb11b185a22cdbc608c6823dd1744dd7f4c4f,Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,"Computer Science, Computer Science",1,923ab69ac9af990acee3a5cd5906f36c,10.48550/arXiv.2505.23820,2505.23820,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Moosajee",2024,"Background: Visual impairment can significantly impact an individual’s daily activities. Patients require regular monitoring, typically occurring within hospital eye services. Capacity constraints have necessitated innovative solutions to improve patient care. Existing digital solutions rely on task-based digital home monitoring such as visual acuity testing. These require active involvement from patients and do not typically offer an indication of quality of life. Digital phenotyping refers to the use of personal digital devices to quantify passive behaviour for detecting clinically significant changes in vision and act as biomarkers for disease. Its uniqueness lies in the ability to detect changes passively. The objective was to co-design an accessible smartphone app (OverSight) for the purposes of digital phenotyping in people with sight impairment. Methods: Development of OverSight included stakeholder consultations following principles of user-centred design. Apple iOS software frameworks (HealthKit, ResearchKit, and SensorKit) and a SwiftUI developer toolkit were used to enable the collection of active and passive data streams. Accessibility and usability were assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and feedback following a 3-month pilot study. Consultations with patients informed the design of OverSight, including preferred survey scheduling and the relevancy of patient support resources. Results: Twenty visually impaired participants (mean age 42 ± 19 years) were recruited to the pilot study. The average score on the SUS was 76.8 (±8.9), indicating good usability. There was a statistically significant moderate negative correlation between SUS scores and visual acuity in both the better (r = −0.494; p ≤ 0.001) and worse eye (r = −0.421; p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: OverSight offers promising potential for collecting patient-generated health data for the purposes of digital phenotyping in patients with eye disease. Through further testing and validation, this novel approach to patient care may ultimately provide opportunities for remote monitoring in ophthalmology.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9021274480670269e8be59e16213dbacb485c2f7,https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare12242550,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9021274480670269e8be59e16213dbacb485c2f7,Healthcare,"Medicine, Medicine, Computer Science, Engineering",1,5c8c31a797b17bb6282b17a31113c8c3,10.3390/healthcare12242550,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

As the application of such superhuman models becomes more and more popular, a critical question arises here: how can we ensure superhuman models are still safe, reliable and aligned well to human values? In this position paper, we discuss the concept of superalignment from the learning perspective to answer this question by outlining the learning paradigm shift from large-scale pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, to alignment training. We define superalignment as designing effective and efficient alignment algorithms to learn from noisy-labeled data (point-wise samples or pair-wise preference data) in a scalable way when the task becomes very complex for human experts to annotate and the model is stronger than human experts. We highlight some key research problems in superalignment, namely, weak-to-strong generalization, scalable oversight, and evaluation. We then present a conceptual framework for superalignment, which consists of three modules: an attacker which generates adversary queries trying to expose the weaknesses of a learner model; a learner which will refine itself by learning from scalable feedbacks generated by a critic model along with minimal human experts; and a critic which generates critics or explanations for a given query-response pair, with a target of improving the learner by criticizing. We discuss some important research problems in each component of this framework and highlight some interesting research ideas that are closely related to our proposed framework, for instance, self-alignment, self-play, self-refinement, and more.

Leder, Alvaro Kohn-Luque",2024,"Predicting cancer dynamics under treatment is challenging due to high inter-patient heterogeneity, lack of predictive biomarkers, and sparse and noisy longitudinal data. Mathematical models can summarize cancer dynamics by a few interpretable parameters per patient. Machine learning methods can then be trained to predict the model parameters from baseline covariates, but do not account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Instead, hierarchical Bayesian modeling can model the relationship between baseline covariates to longitudinal measurements via mechanistic parameters while accounting for uncertainty in every part of the model. The mapping from baseline covariates to model parameters can be modeled in several ways. A linear mapping simplifies inference but fails to capture nonlinear covariate effects and scale poorly for interaction modeling when the number of covariates is large. In contrast, Bayesian neural networks can potentially discover interactions between covariates automatically, but at a substantial cost in computational complexity. In this work, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of subpopulation dynamics that uses baseline covariate information to predict cancer dynamics under treatment, inspired by cancer dynamics in multiple myeloma (MM), where serum M protein is a well-known proxy of tumor burden. As a working example, we apply the model to a simulated dataset and compare its ability to predict M protein trajectories to a model with linear covariate effects. Our results show that the Bayesian neural network covariate effect model predicts cancer dynamics more accurately than a linear covariate effect model when covariate interactions are present. The framework can also be applied to other types of cancer or other time series prediction problems that can be described with a parametric model.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26ecd81405c7df09ef0fe2550029e319785f4a7b,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14508.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26ecd81405c7df09ef0fe2550029e319785f4a7b,,"Biology, Mathematics, Medicine, Computer Science",1,b5ffe382ed3f6e60b24454177a2c841c,,2405.14508,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

To this end, the aim of various research works in systems theory is to develop inductive modeling (based on data-intensive analysis) or deductive modeling (based on the deduction of mechanistic principles) to discover patterns and identify plausible correlations between past and present events, or to connect different causal relationships of interacting elements at different scales and compute mathematical predictions. Mathematical principles assume that there are constant and observable universal causal principles that apply to all biological systems. Nowadays, there are no suitable tools to assess the soundness of these universal causal principles, especially considering that organisms not only respond to environmental stimuli (and inherent processes) across multiple scales but also integrate information about and within these scales. This implies an uncontrollable degree of uncertainty. Methodology A method has been developed to detect the stability of causal processes by evaluating the information contained in the trajectories identified in a phase space. Time series patterns are analyzed using concepts from geometric information theory and persistent homology. In essence, recognizing these patterns in different time periods and evaluating their geometrically integrated information leads to the assessment of causal relationships. With this method, and together with the evaluation of persistent entropy in trajectories in relation to different individual systems, we have developed a method called Φ-S diagram as a complexity measure to recognize when organisms follow causal pathways leading to mechanistic responses. Results We calculated the Φ-S diagram of a deterministic dataset available in the ICU repository to test the method’s interpretability. We also calculated the Φ-S diagram of time series from health data available in the same repository. This includes patients’ physiological response to sport measured with wearables outside laboratory conditions. We confirmed the mechanistic nature of both datasets in both calculations. In addition, there is evidence that some individuals show a high degree of autonomous response and variability. Therefore, persistent individual variability may limit the ability to observe the cardiac response. In this study, we present the first demonstration of the concept of developing a more robust framework for representing complex biological systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e2bb83a0a849ba62a61123310931ee723200710,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/01/23/2022.01.21.477230.full.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e2bb83a0a849ba62a61123310931ee723200710,bioRxiv,"Biology, Computer Science, Medicine, Biology, Engineering",1,9b23bdfb577a37b43a0ebb4f09cfa1af,10.1101/2022.01.21.477230,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Wiemann, Lukas Bonekemper, Jonas Kappel, Peter Kraemer",2023,"Modal analysis is one of the elementary tools for the analysis of structural dynamics. In context of vibration-based damage diagnosis and continuous monitoring of modal quantities, different variants of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) were developed. In most cases, the results of the analysis (modal data) are improved by post-processing methods, e.g., by clustering of stable poles in stability diagrams. The aim of this paper is to facilitate the automatic interpretability of the computational results by preprocessing techniques. The method presented in this paper is used to distinguish between the physical poles and the unwanted mathematical poles to determine the natural frequencies more accurately. This is necessary because for the monitoring of complex real structures, high model orders are required, leading to the occurrence of mathematical poles. To enable a reliable separation, the spectral signal components are analyzed regarding their information content and their energy level in a specific frequency band. For this purpose, the widespread assumption is used that the largest singular values of the system response are related to the highest signal energy and that the lower singular values are caused by noise. With the use of different narrow frequency bands (e.g., by using bandpass filters), the estimation of an accurate threshold between noise and eigenfrequencies can be well established for each band. This technique is applied on the Covariance-Driven Stochastic Subspace Identification algorithm (SSI-COV) for OMA. In context of SSI-COV the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and the estimated threshold is used to build reduced and reassembled Hankel matrices from partial sum matrices for each frequency band separately. The advantage of the reduced matrices is that only physical poles have plausible modal damping values, and these can be well separate from mathematical poles. The effectiveness of the method is first demonstrated on simulated data and then successfully tested on a laboratory structure. The results, the advantages, and limitations of the method as well as the need for further improvements are discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2137d764c1f09807af5abc9137030aabf048243,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2137d764c1f09807af5abc9137030aabf048243,Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring,Engineering,1,eeed0e35191275df6e5d0ff50f50eeca,10.12783/shm2023/37039,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

For coprime planar arrays comprising two uniform rectangular subarrays, we link the signal separation to the tensor‐based model called coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and propose an improved coupled trilinear decomposition approach. The output data of coprime planar arrays are modeled as a coupled tensor set that can be further interpreted as a coupled CPD model, allowing a signal separation to be achieved using coupled trilinear alternating least squares (TALS). Furthermore, in the procedure of the coupled TALS, a Vandermonde structure enforcing approach is explicitly applied, which is shown to ensure fast convergence.

Tamadazte",2020,"Reconstruction of 3D objects in various tomographic measurements is an important problem which can be naturally addressed within the mathematical framework of 3D tensors. In Optical Coherence Tomography, the reconstruction problem can be recast as a tensor completion problem. Following the seminal work of Candès et al., the approach followed in the present work is based on the assumption that the rank of the object to be reconstructed is naturally small, and we leverage this property by using a nuclear norm-type penalisation. In this paper, a detailed study of nuclear norm penalised reconstruction using the tubal Singular Value Decomposition of Kilmer et al. is proposed. In particular, we introduce a new, efficiently computable definition of the nuclear norm in the Kilmer et al. framework. We then present a theoretical analysis, which extends previous results by Koltchinskii Lounici and Tsybakov. Finally, this nuclear norm penalised reconstruction method is applied to real data reconstruction experiments in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).

The aim of this study was to empirically identify the relationship between social support as a resource and the stability of an individual's mental health in wartime conditions. The following methods were used in the study: “The Mental Health Continuum – Short Form” (E.L. Nosenko, A.H. Chetveryk-Burchak), and the BASIC Ph Model. Mathematical-statistical methods applied included correlation analysis with the determination of the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the determination of differences using the Student's t-test. The study sample consisted of 382 Ukrainians living in Ukraine (of which 116 were men and 266 were women), with an average age of 21.3 years (ranging from 18 to 43 years). The results obtained demonstrate that more than a third of the respondents have a low level of stability of mental health, which is interpreted as a state of depression, a tense psycho-emotional state, passivity in activity and interaction with others. To overcome this state, the respondents most often resort to cognitive skills, belief and physical activity. Analysis of the relationship between mental health stability and various forms of social support revealed that communication and interaction with friends, family members, and members of organisations or communities to which one belongs are associated with higher indicators of mental health and well-being. Differences in mental health indicators and the use of social support were also found between men and women. Men are less likely to use social support as a method of coping with difficult life circumstances. The obtained data do not exhaust the problem of studying social support as a factor of mental health in wartime conditions, but they confirm that communication and interaction are associated with the psychological health and well-being of the individual",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/825de7074e437f40e272acdd617179be0d5a6802,https://sppstudios.com.ua/web/uploads/pdf/Scientific Studios on Social and Political Psychology_30(1)2024-39-45.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/825de7074e437f40e272acdd617179be0d5a6802,Scientific Studios on Social and Political Psychology,Psychology,1,ff17cb6a05896c178cb1966c35b1e5c3,10.61727/sssppj/1.2024.39,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

This development urges a harmonizing understanding across academia and industry for adoption of interpretable models instead of black-box models for advanced control strategies such as model predictive control (MPC), especially when applied in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulated areas. To this end, we first propose a comprehensive model development using Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc)to represent complex dynamics in a lower-dimensional space, disambiguating between underlying dynamics and actuation effects. Using data from a digital twin of PCM, our model demonstrates low computational complexity while effectively capturing nonlinear dynamics with significant improvements observed in the performance metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate enhanced uncertainty propagation performance when compared to state-space models obtained with N4SID and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems with control algorithms. Finally, we develop a closed-loop workflow that seamlessly connects data exchanges between Python (DMDc), GAMS (MPC optimisation) & gPROMS to evaluate the controller performance with setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection studies achieving high accuracy in real-time monitoring and control of granule size.

The performance of electron holography is limited by the ""shot noise"" inherent in electron micrographs (holograms), which are composed of a finite number of electrons. A promising approach for addressing this issue is to use mathematical and machine learning-based image-processing techniques for hologram denoising. With the advancement of information science, denoising methods have become capable of extracting signals that are completely buried in noise, and they are being applied to electron microscopy, including electron holography. However, these advanced denoising methods are complex and have many parameters to be tuned; therefore, it is necessary to understand their principles in depth and use them carefully. Herein, we present an overview of the principles and usage of sparse coding, wavelet hidden Markov model, and tensor decomposition, which have been applied to electron holography.

However, existing methods have limitations in accurately identifying cell types while maintaining model interpretability, especially in the presence of noise. Methods We propose a novel method called scMFG, which leverages feature grouping and group integration techniques for the integration of single-cell multi-omics data. By organizing features with similar characteristics within each omics layer through feature grouping. Furthermore, scMFG ensures a consistent feature grouping approach across different omics layers, promoting comparability of diverse data types. Additionally, scMFG incorporates a matrix factorization-based approach to enable the integrated results remain interpretable. Results We comprehensively evaluated scMFG’s performance on four complex real-world datasets generated using diverse sequencing technologies, highlighting its robustness in accurately identifying cell types. Notably, scMFG exhibited superior performance in deciphering cellular heterogeneity at a finer resolution compared to existing methods when applied to simulated datasets. Furthermore, our method proved highly effective in identifying rare cell types, showcasing its robust performance and suitability for detecting low-abundance cellular populations. The interpretability of scMFG was successfully validated through its specific association of outputs with specific cell types or states observed in the neonatal mouse cerebral cortices dataset. Moreover, we demonstrated that scMFG is capable of identifying cell developmental trajectories even in datasets with batch effects.

Brøndum, Marta Pelizzola, A. Hobolth, Martin Bøgsted",2025,"Since its introduction, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been a popular tool for extracting interpretable, low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. However, several recent studies have proposed replacing NMF with autoencoders. The increasing popularity of autoencoders warrants an investigation on whether this replacement is in general valid and reasonable. Moreover, the exact relationship between non-negative autoencoders and NMF has not been thoroughly explored. Thus, a main aim of this study is to investigate in detail the relationship between autoencoders and NMF. We define a non-negative linear autoencoder, AE-NMF, which is mathematically equivalent with convex NMF, a constrained version of NMF. The performance of NMF and the non-negative linear autoencoder is compared within the context of mutational signature extraction from simulated and real-world cancer genomics data. We find that the reconstructions based on NMF are more accurate compared with AE-NMF, while the signatures extracted using both methods exhibit comparable consistency and performance when externally validated. These findings suggest that AE-NMF, the linear non-negative autoencoders investigated in this article, do not provide an improvement of NMF in the field of mutational signature extraction. Our study serves as a foundation for understanding the theoretical implication of replacing NMF with non-negative autoencoders.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6506fe550fe05f5b6233f78e30e58c4301e3c826,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6506fe550fe05f5b6233f78e30e58c4301e3c826,J.

Some algorithms which are based on incorporating sparsity constraints in the nonconvex NMF optimization problem are applied in the past for analyzing microarray datasets. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these algorithms use block coordinate descent method which is known for providing closed form solutions.

Weinstock, Rebecca Keener, Surya B. Chhetri, Marios Arvanitis, Alexis Battle",2024,"Complex trait-associated genetic variation is highly pleiotropic. This extensive pleiotropy implies that multi-phenotype analyses are informative for characterizing genetic associations, as they facilitate the discovery of trait-shared and trait-specific variants and pathways (“genetic factors”). Previous efforts have estimated genetic factors using matrix factorization (MF) applied to numerous GWAS. However, existing methods are susceptible to spurious factors arising from residual confounding due to sample-sharing in biobank GWAS. Furthermore, MF approaches have historically estimated dense factors, loaded on most traits and variants, that are challenging to map onto interpretable biological pathways. To address these shortcomings, we introduce “GWAS latent embeddings accounting for noise and regularization” (GLEANR), a MF method for detection of sparse genetic factors from summary statistics. GLEANR accounts for sample sharing between studies and uses regularization to estimate a data-driven number of interpretable factors. GLEANR is robust to confounding induced by shared samples and improves the replication of genetic factors derived from distinct biobanks. We used GLEANR to evaluate 137 diverse GWAS from the UK Biobank, identifying 58 factors that decompose the genetic architecture of input traits and have distinct signatures of negative selection and degrees of polygenicity. These sparse factors can be interpreted with respect to disease, cell-type, and pathway enrichment. We highlight three such factors capturing platelet measure phenotypes and enriched for disease-relevant markers corresponding to distinct stages of platelet differentiation. Overall, GLEANR is a powerful tool for discovering both trait-specific and trait-shared pathways underlying complex traits from GWAS summary statistics.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f71359e8fa855241e00e3092cd5419271b1a210,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/11/14/2024.11.12.623313.full.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f71359e8fa855241e00e3092cd5419271b1a210,bioRxiv,"Biology, Medicine, Biology, Computer Science",1,46d9b49d52214770087a950d6be7eea0,10.1101/2024.11.12.623313,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

However, existing NMF-based multi-view clustering methods perform NMF on each view data respectively and ignore the impact of between-view. Thus, they can't well exploit the within-view spatial structure and between-view complementary information. To resolve this issue, we present semi-non-negative tensor factorization (Semi-NTF) and develop a novel multi-view clustering based on Semi-NTF with one-side orthogonal constraint. Our model directly performs Semi-NTF on the 3rd-order tensor which is composed of anchor graphs of views. Thus, our model directly considers the between-view relationship. Moreover, we use the tensor Schatten p-norm regularization as a rank approximation of the 3rd-order tensor which characterizes the cluster structure of multi-view data and exploits the between-view complementary information.

Dysfunction and apoptosis in immune cells result from the exposure to continuous tumor-related antigen stimulation and coinhibitory signals. To date, key factors pointing to the restriction of NB-specific CD8+ T cells remain elusive. Methods We performed bulk-RNA sequencing and lipidomic analyses of children with mediastinal NB. Bioinformatics analysis and biological validation were applied to uncover the underlying mechanism. Results Three subtypes were identified using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), among which we highlighted an apoptotic status of infiltrated CD8+ T cells, along with the highest CD52 and EDF1 expression in Cluster3 (C3) subtypes. It was verified that high EDF1 expression in NB cells led to Lactosylceramide (LacCer) accumulation, as well as downstream ganglioside-GD3, which subsequently increased the expression of CD52 and immune checkpoint genes, chemotaxis, and apoptosis-related events in activated CD8+T cells. Mechanistically, EDF1 was recruited as a coactivator to form the NF-κB/RelA/EDF1 complex, which further prevented the promoter region methylation of ST8SIA1, to elevate its transcription. Conclusion These findings characterize abundant GD3 in NB cells, which regulated by the EDF1/RelA/ST8SIA1 axis, is responsible for CD8+ T cell dysfunction. Inhibition of EDF1 may reduce suppressive factors and prevent immune escape of NB cells. Modulating NB-associated GD3 levels through metabolic intervention is beneficial for tuning the depth and duration of responses to current NB therapies. The integration of transcriptomic and lipidomic data offers a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between LacCer metabolites and the immune status in NB.

Currently, discrete gradient dynamics analysis has been successfully applied to shallow networks but encounters the difficulty of complex computation for deep networks.

Dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as an effective way to attenuate spatially incoherent noise without damaging useful signals. DL can adaptively learn atoms that best represent the structure of seismic data in a fully data-driven way, and thus can be applied in arbitrarily complex seismic datasets. Due to the existence of strong noise, the dictionary atoms could be strongly affected, e.g., containing many atoms that show quite irregular structures. Here, we propose a new method for effectively rejecting those noise-contaminated atoms while maintaining the most representative atoms, so as to improve the denoising performance. Atom classification is performed by taking advantage of the statistical features of the atoms in each category, e.g., regular (for signal) and irregular (for noise). More importantly, the rejection of atoms with a high probability of noise inference is controlled easily by a threshold, below which the atom is preserved for sparse coding and denoising. An efficient dictionary updating scheme is also used to avoid the computationally expensive singular value decomposition (SVD).

However, the paucity of labelled data inhibits classification models' training. Researchers have turned to generative deep learning techniques combined with signal processing to augment the existing data and improve cardiac auscultation classification models to overcome this challenge. However, the primary focus of prior studies has been on model performance as opposed to model robustness. Robustness, in this case, is defined as both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by measures such as Matthew's correlation coefficient. This work shows that more robust abnormal heart sound classifiers can be trained using an augmented dataset. The augmentations consist of traditional audio approaches and the creation of synthetic audio conditionally generated using the WaveGrad and DiffWave diffusion models.

Though large language models (LLM) could automate the coding process and improve the efficiency of such tasks, interpretability remains paramount for maintaining patient trust. Current efforts in interpretability of medical coding applications rely heavily on label attention mechanisms, which often leads to the highlighting of extraneous tokens irrelevant to the ICD code. To facilitate accurate interpretability in medical language models, this paper leverages dictionary learning that can efficiently extract sparsely activated representations from dense language model embeddings in superposition. Compared with common label attention mechanisms, our model goes beyond token-level representations by building an interpretable dictionary which enhances the mechanistic-based explanations for each ICD code prediction, even when the highlighted tokens are medically irrelevant. We show that dictionary features are human interpretable, can elucidate the hidden meanings of upwards of 90% of medically irrelevant tokens, and steer model behavior.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32a392b949cb8d9e967c4b9d3885aec2ec1c732e,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00173,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32a392b949cb8d9e967c4b9d3885aec2ec1c732e,Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Medicine",1,33dc46b8e8a4101a2a7bbdbecf06b3f5,10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.500,2411.00173,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

These sophisticated innovations rely on breakthrough technology to provide intelligent platforms for health monitoring, quick illness recognition, and precise treatment. Biomedical signal processing determines patterns of signals and serves as the backbone for reliable applications, medical diagnostics, and research. Deep Learning (DL) methods have brought significant innovation in biomedical signal processing, leading to the transformation of the health sector and medical diagnostics. This article covers an entire range of technical innovations evolved for DL-based biomedical signal processing where different modalities have been considered, including Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), and Electroencephalography (EEG). A vast amount of biomedical data in various forms is available, and DL concepts are required to extract and model this data in order to identify hidden complex patterns that can be utilized to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment of diseases in an individual. The nature of this developing topic certainly gives rise to a number of challenges. First, the application of sensitive and noisy time series data requires truly robust models. Second, many inferences made at the bedside must have interpretability by design. Third, the field will require that processing be performed in real-time if used for therapeutic interventions. We systematically evaluate these challenges and highlight areas where continued research is needed.

Noise removal while protecting useful signals has been the long-term research focus of seismic exploration and data processing. Seldom methods can be used to deal with all these types of noise simultaneously, which motivates the study of this research. Here, we propose a systematic and effective method to tackle various kinds of complex seismic noise in seismic data by designing a dictionary learning approach. To deal with random and high-amplitude noise, we propose a robust inversion framework to estimate the signals from noise-corrupted data iteratively. The inversion scheme is inspired by an $L1$ -norm regularized iterative denoising framework but performs conveniently in terms of the coherency-promoting denoising operator. Then, we propose a bandpass-limited signal retrieving scheme internally within the iterative framework to tackle the ground-roll suppression issue. The iterative robust dictionary learning approach is based on a singular-value decomposition (SVD)-free approach to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the denoising performance.

Addressing the challenge of inflexible reference images in unconditional diffusion probability models and enhancing image denoising performance is of paramount importance. In this research, we propose a novel image denoising model based on component decoupling and introduce sensitivity decoupling operators to prevent entanglement and redundancy among different decoupling models. Additionally, we leverage a model-driven network to fuse image components, resisting noise and model degradation, thereby aiding network convergence. Subsequently, we construct an image adaptive denoising model incorporating diffusion probability and dictionary learning. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over other algorithms in grayscale image processing on the Set12 dataset, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 35.75 dB and an average structural similarity (SSIM) value of 92.68%. Similarly, on the BSD68 dataset, our algorithm outperforms others with a PSNR of 34.35 dB and an average SSIM of 93.89%.

Rana, Jianhao Peng, Chao Pan, Hanbaek Lyu, Albert Cheng, Minji Kim, O. Milenkovic",2023,"Dictionary learning (DL), implemented via matrix factorization (MF), is commonly used in computational biology to tackle ubiquitous clustering problems. The method is favored due to its conceptual simplicity and relatively low computational complexity. However, DL algorithms produce results that lack interpretability in terms of real biological data. Additionally, they are not optimized for graph-structured data and hence often fail to handle them in a scalable manner. In order to address these limitations, we propose a novel DL algorithm called online convex network dictionary learning (online cvxNDL). Unlike classical DL algorithms, online cvxNDL is implemented via MF and designed to handle extremely large datasets by virtue of its online nature. Importantly, it enables the interpretation of dictionary elements, which serve as cluster representatives, through convex combinations of real measurements. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to data with a network structure by incorporating specialized subnetwork sampling techniques. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply cvxNDL on 3D-genome RNAPII ChIA-Drop data with the goal of identifying important long-range interaction patterns (long-range dictionary elements). ChIA-Drop probes higher-order interactions, and produces data in the form of hypergraphs whose nodes represent genomic fragments. The hyperedges represent observed physical contacts. Our hypergraph model analysis has the objective of creating an interpretable dictionary of long-range interaction patterns that accurately represent global chromatin physical contact maps. Through the use of dictionary information, one can also associate the contact maps with RNA transcripts and infer cellular functions. To accomplish the task at hand, we focus on RNAPII-enriched ChIA-Drop data from Drosophila Melanogaster S2 cell lines. Our results offer two key insights. First, we demonstrate that online cvxNDL retains the accuracy of classical DL (MF) methods while simultaneously ensuring unique interpretability and scalability. Second, we identify distinct collections of proximal and distal interaction patterns involving chromatin elements shared by related processes across different chromosomes, as well as patterns unique to specific chromosomes. To associate the dictionary elements with biological properties of the corresponding chromatin regions, we employ Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and perform multiple RNA coexpression studies. Availability and Implementation The code and test datasets are available at:\ https://github.com/rana95vishal/chromatin_DL/ Author summary We introduce a novel method for dictionary learning termed online convex Network Dictionary Learning (online cvxNDL). The method operates in an online manner and utilizes representative subnetworks of a network dataset as dictionary elements. A key feature of online cvxNDL is its ability to work with graph-structured data and generate dictionary elements that represent convex combinations of real data points, thus ensuring interpretability. Online cvxNDL is used to investigate long-range chromatin interactions in S2 cell lines of Drosophila Melanogaster obtained through RNAPII ChIA-Drop measurements represented as hypergraphs. The results show that dictionary elements can accurately and efficiently reconstruct the original interactions present in the data, even when subjected to convexity constraints. To shed light on the biological relevance of the identified dictionaries, we perform Gene Ontology enrichment and RNA-seq coexpression analyses. These studies uncover multiple long-range interaction patterns that are chromosome-specific. Furthermore, the findings affirm the significance of convex dictionaries in representing TADs cross-validated by imaging methods (such as 3-color FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization)).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcdf87b4f9510424963de5f7251c3b1fd579e579,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012095&type=printable,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcdf87b4f9510424963de5f7251c3b1fd579e579,bioRxiv,"Computer Science, Medicine, Biology, Computer Science, Biology",1,7927f3aa4f4e24148d8d12b6a542a578,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012095,2312.10519,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

The involved sparsifying transformations or dictionaries are typically either pre-trained using a model which reflects the assumed properties of the signals or adaptively learned during the reconstruction - yielding so-called blind Compressed Sensing approaches. However, by doing so, the transforms are never explicitly trained in conjunction with the physical model which generates the signals. In addition, properly choosing the involved regularization parameters remains a challenging task. Another recently emerged training-paradigm for regularization methods is to use iterative neural networks (INNs) - also known as unrolled networks - which contain the physical model. In this work, we construct an INN which can be used as a supervised and physics-informed online convolutional dictionary learning algorithm. We evaluated the proposed approach by applying it to a realistic large-scale dynamic MR reconstruction problem and compared it to several other recently published works.

According to our simulations, the proposed algorithms have noticeable improvement in both convergence rate and computational load in comparison to one-dimensional methods.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10e12e1e791f2e4876e3603de13eb72771b91f80,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10e12e1e791f2e4876e3603de13eb72771b91f80,European Signal Processing Conference,"Computer Science, Computer Science",1,0c9aee81fcfe0162a47939a2bdf84370,10.23919/Eusipco47968.2020.9287479,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Novikov, Stephen White",2022,"Dictionary learning, the problem of recovering a sparsely used matrix $\mathbf{D} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times K}$ and $N$ $s$-sparse vectors $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$ from samples of the form $\mathbf{y}_i = \mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}_i$, is of increasing importance to applications in signal processing and data science. When the dictionary is known, recovery of $\mathbf{x}_i$ is possible even for sparsity linear in dimension $M$, yet to date, the only algorithms which provably succeed in the linear sparsity regime are Riemannian trust-region methods, which are limited to orthogonal dictionaries, and methods based on the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which requires super-polynomial time in order to obtain an error which decays in $M$. In this work, we introduce SPORADIC (SPectral ORAcle DICtionary Learning), an efficient spectral method on family of reweighted covariance matrices. We prove that in high enough dimensions, SPORADIC can recover overcomplete ($K>M$) dictionaries satisfying the well-known restricted isometry property (RIP) even when sparsity is linear in dimension up to logarithmic factors. Moreover, these accuracy guarantees have an ``oracle property""that the support and signs of the unknown sparse vectors $\mathbf{x}_i$ can be recovered exactly with high probability, allowing for arbitrarily close estimation of $\mathbf{D}$ with enough samples in polynomial time. To the author's knowledge, SPORADIC is the first polynomial-time algorithm which provably enjoys such convergence guarantees for overcomplete RIP matrices in the near-linear sparsity regime.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba727f22256588d70d9f5d4a16b7a786983c7e9a,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10855.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba727f22256588d70d9f5d4a16b7a786983c7e9a,International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory,"Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Mathematics",1,27283fca6e0adbcc9e034c5741ca9904,,2210.10855,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

It is key in many applications of machine learning and signal processing. Solving SSC up to global optimality has never been explored in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we propose a reformulation of SSC into a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) solvable globally by generic solvers. We also consider a variant of SSC with nonnegativity constraints. We show experimentally that the global resolution can be applied in practice to medium-scale problems. For larger-scale problems, we propose a hybrid method that first uses a heuristic as a pre-processing to reduce the size of the original problem, and then solves the reduced problem exactly.

Wood",2023,"Spike sorting is a crucial step in the analysis of multichannel neural signals that enables the identification of individual neurons’ activity. However, the limited availability of low-power neuromorphic spike sorting methods is due to the difficulty of processing high-density multichannel extracellular neural signals. In this study, we propose to use the locally competitive algorithm (LCA) that has been previously implemented on neuromorphic hardware as a novel feature extraction method for spike sorting. Based on a bio-inspired neural network, LCA can learn a signal-dependent dictionary of spatiotemporal features and give highly sparse representations. The proposed approach results in better sorting accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios compared to k-SVD, a well-known sparse coding model, and the principal component analysis (PCA), a classical approach in spike sorting.

Haakma, Rik Vullings",2025,"Objective. Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable continuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising strategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However, monitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise the signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe artifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer interpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study proposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition and deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to integrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network, improving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model encodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of kernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained for denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model from the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily activities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep learning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method, on average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB and reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA dataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and comparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance.

Reconstruction is posited as a convex optimization minimizing energy. Formal conditions under which perfect and approximate reconstruction of the signal from the spike trains is possible are then identified.

Accurate fault diagnosis under varying speed conditions remains a challenging task, especially when dealing with weak, nonperiodic fault features embedded in noise and in the absence of angle encoder. This article proposes an improved multilayer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) model incorporating an overlap-crop (OC) operation for effective fault feature extraction under such conditions. The ML-CSC framework enhances the capability to extract weak transients by stacking multiple convolutional layers, while the OC operation mitigates boundary-induced transient effects and enables efficient parallel processing. The proposed method is validated using both simulated and real-world vibration signals under varying speed conditions. Compared with the existing approaches—including vanilla convolutional sparse coding (CSC), CSC-DFT, tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), and WMSDL—the OC CSC consistently yields higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements and better reconstruction accuracy. The use of multilayer dictionaries proves effective in capturing complex fault dynamics, with two- and three-layer models offering enhanced performance without significantly increasing model complexity.

Vullings",2022,"The use of wearable technology for monitoring a person’s health status is becoming increasingly more popular. Unfortunately, this technology typically suffers from low-quality measurement data, making the acquisition of, for instance, the heart rate based on electrocardiography data from non-adhesive sensors challenging. Such sensors are prone to motion artifacts and hence the electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements require signal processing to enhance their quality and enable detection of the heart rate. Over the last years, considerable progress has been made in the use of deep neural networks for many signal processing challenges. Yet, for healthcare applications their success is limited because the required large datasets to train these networks are typically not available. In this paper we propose a method to embed prior knowledge about the measurement data and problem statement in the network architecture to make it more data efficient. Our proposed method aims to enhance the quality of ECG signals by describing ECG signals from the perspective of a multi-measurement vector convolutional sparse coding model and use a deep unfolded neural network architecture to learn the model parameters. The sparse coding problem was solved using the Alternation Direction Method of Multipliers. Our method was evaluated by denoising ECG signals, that were corrupted by adding noise to clean ECG signals, and subsequently detecting the heart beats from the denoised data and compare these to the heartbeats and derived heartrate variability features detected in the clean ECG signals. This evaluation demonstrated an improved in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement ranging from 17 to 27 dB and an improvement in heart rate detection (i.e. F1 score) ranging between 0 and 50%, where the range depends on the SNR of the input signals.

Two recent papers (Baumgartner and Gebharter [2016]; Baumgartner and Casini [2017]) propose a theoretical alternative to (MM) in light of several important conceptual objections. Their alternative approach, the no de-coupling (NDC) account, conceives of constitution as a dependence relation that once postulated provides the best explanation of the impossibility of breaking the common cause coupling of a macro-level mechanism and its micro-level components. This entails an abductive view of constitutive inference. Proponents of the NDC or abductive account recognize that their discussion leaves open a big question concerning the practical dimension of the notion of constitutive relevanssssce: Is it possible to faithfully reconstruct constitutional reasoning in science in terms of a failure to de-couple, via interlevel experiments, phenomena from their mechanistic constituents? Focusing on the field of memory and long-term potential (LTP) research, this article argues that the abductive account provides a more adequate description of interlevel experiments in neuroscience. We also suggest that the account highlights some significant practical recommendations of how to interpret the findings of interlevel experiments. 1. Introduction2.

The difficulties that humans face in acknowledging cognitive senses and abilities are only because of the singularity of our views on human cognition. If animals have feelings, there might be a case to be made that robots do have. Non-expert users interacting with robots may mislead the functionality of the robot. If someone is present in front of a robot and the robot can determine their sex, accent of English and emotion simply from their speech data, it helps in development of an embedded cognitive model. Though having limitations, studies in neuroscience have shown that animal models have significantly contributed to the understanding of the mechanistic and functional aspects of cognitive activities such as speaking. As a result, the usage of robots in a range of industries requires the capacity to make understandable and expressive speech. Thus, we present three models for identifying sex, accent, and emotion. To attain better outcomes, we have proposed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and adjusted it as needed. To evaluate how well the model can perform, we have employed the attention layer, bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Dropout concepts and judged our trainable datapoints to be very large. The experimental results show our superior findings, in terms of accuracy obtained in identification of sex and accent: 94.62%, 97.37% consecutively and recognition of emotion: 99.84%, which suggest that our study might be applied in the future as a noteworthy solution for the aforementioned problems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/551a1bb411e2199884d1f3d8d1298ada535f558a,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/551a1bb411e2199884d1f3d8d1298ada535f558a,International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Psychology",1,cfada617fae57be186d2b0db46af3b8f,10.1109/ICCCNT54827.2022.9984265,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

 Predicting the coefficient of friction (COF) is essential for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of mechanical systems. Nevertheless, traditional mechanistic models relying on fixed values or fitted curves fail to accurately capture this complexity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a model for predicting the COF of wet friction components using an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm optimized by the sparrow search algorithm (SSA). This model effectively captures the nonlinear relationships among relative speed, pressure, temperature, and COF. As a result, the proposed SSA-XGBoost model exhibits excellent predictive performance with an RMSE of only 0.063, and 88.3% of the COF predictions have a relative error of less than 1%, significantly outperforming other deep learning algorithms. Additionally, to enhance the understanding of the COF prediction results for wet friction components, SHAP interpretability analysis is used to explore the influence of relative speed, pressure, and temperature on the predicted COF values.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ae5cdeb154b7d5c1a3fcbb39c4dc28daf422d3a,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ae5cdeb154b7d5c1a3fcbb39c4dc28daf422d3a,Journal of tribology,"Engineering, Materials Science",1,03d39aebe77e880379f5a611f5c221d0,10.1115/1.4067111,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Materials Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00

This paper presents a novel methodology for interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR 50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear operations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e2bafb0a851afa00bc4a6a635acb175ee16fc2d,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09931.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e2bafb0a851afa00bc4a6a635acb175ee16fc2d,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Engineering, Computer Science",1,e058912974523b3a3b1cf85a648f12f0,10.48550/arXiv.2507.09931,2507.09931,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:59.030544+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:59.030544+00:00

These biases can potentially contribute to harmful real-world consequences, reinforcing stereotypes and exacerbating inequalities in various social contexts. While existing research on diffusion bias mitigation has predominantly focused on guiding content generation, it often neglects the intrinsic mechanisms within diffusion models that causally drive biased outputs. In this paper, we investigate the internal processes of diffusion models, identifying specific decision-making mechanisms, termed bias features, embedded within the model architecture. By directly manipulating these features, our method precisely isolates and adjusts the elements responsible for bias generation, permitting granular control over the bias levels in the generated content. Through experiments on both unconditional and conditional diffusion models across various social bias attributes, we demonstrate our method’s efficacy in managing generation distribution while preserving image quality.

In our experiments, we use spatial autocorrelation to show how features obtained for placenames display spatial patterns related to their geographic location and can thus be interpreted geospatially, providing insights into how these models process geographical information.

Bahador,2025,"Mechanistic interpretability improves the safety, reliability, and robustness of large AI models. This study examined individual attention heads in vision transformers (ViTs) fine tuned on distorted 2D spectrogram images containing non relevant content (axis labels, titles, color bars). By introducing extraneous features, the study analyzed how transformer components processed unrelated information, using mechanistic interpretability to debug issues and reveal insights into transformer architectures. Attention maps assessed head contributions across layers. Heads in early layers (1 to 3) showed minimal task impact with ablation increased MSE loss slightly ({\mu}=0.11%, {\sigma}=0.09%), indicating focus on less critical low level features. In contrast, deeper heads (e.g., layer 6) caused a threefold higher loss increase ({\mu}=0.34%, {\sigma}=0.02%), demonstrating greater task importance. Intermediate layers (6 to 11) exhibited monosemantic behavior, attending exclusively to chirp regions. Some early heads (1 to 4) were monosemantic but non task relevant (e.g. text detectors, edge or corner detectors). Attention maps distinguished monosemantic heads (precise chirp localization) from polysemantic heads (multiple irrelevant regions).

Importantly, the secret word is not presented to the model in its training data or prompt. We then investigate methods to uncover this secret. First, we evaluate non-interpretability (black-box) approaches. Subsequently, we develop largely automated strategies based on mechanistic interpretability techniques, including logit lens and sparse autoencoders. Evaluation shows that both approaches are effective in eliciting the secret word in our proof-of-concept setting.

Eiben, Sophie Klumper, Guido Schafer, Artem Tsikiridis",2025,"We initiate the study of mechanism design with outliers, where the designer can discard $z$ agents from the social cost objective. This setting is particularly relevant when some agents exhibit extreme or atypical preferences. As a natural case study, we consider facility location on the line: $n$ strategic agents report their preferred locations, and a mechanism places a facility to minimize a social cost function. In our setting, the $z$ agents farthest from the chosen facility are excluded from the social cost. While it may seem intuitive that discarding outliers improves efficiency, our results reveal that the opposite can hold. We derive tight bounds for deterministic strategyproof mechanisms under the two most-studied objectives: utilitarian and egalitarian social cost. Our results offer a comprehensive view of the impact of outliers. We first show that when $z \ge n/2$, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve a bounded approximation for either objective. For egalitarian cost, selecting the $(z + 1)$-th order statistic is strategyproof and 2-approximate. In fact, we show that this is best possible by providing a matching lower bound. Notably, this lower bound of 2 persists even when the mechanism has access to a prediction of the optimal location, in stark contrast to the setting without outliers. For utilitarian cost, we show that strategyproof mechanisms cannot effectively exploit outliers, leading to the counterintuitive outcome that approximation guarantees worsen as the number of outliers increases. However, in this case, access to a prediction allows us to design a strategyproof mechanism achieving the best possible trade-off between consistency and robustness. Finally, we also establish lower bounds for randomized mechanisms that are truthful in expectation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ccc9c5b861516dc495011466f8eeafceb80ec9a,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09561.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ccc9c5b861516dc495011466f8eeafceb80ec9a,,"Computer Science, Economics",0,0a3f630830269f8d75c43c0dd6462603,,2509.09561,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Two types of recyclers, automobile manufacturers and third-party recycling companies, are discussed separately.Design/methodology/approachThe essence of the information screening mechanism is to design differentiated benefit distributed mechanism according to the recycling ability of the recyclers and to inspire them to make their best effort to recycle. The effectiveness of the mechanism is examined and discussed. In addition, the interaction between the government subsidy and information screening mechanism is further analyzed.FindingsRecyclers are incentivized to truthfully report their recycling capabilities under an optimal benefit distribution mechanism, as this obtains greater rewards than misreporting. Government subsidies can enhance information screening by increasing rewards for recyclers who invest more effort. As rewards per unit of EV battery recycled rise, recyclers' efforts also increase. A higher proportion of capable recyclers reduces the profitability of false reporting while boosting manufacturers’ profits.Originality/valueThis paper proposes an information screening mechanism to enhance transparency and efficiency in the EV battery recycling supply chain, addressing information asymmetry.

Moreover, we characterize its limit and convergence speed. We infer an upper bound on the Bayesian approximation ratio when

 k
 > 2. This allows us to introduce criteria to determine which percentile mechanism is better suited to address a given agent distribution. We then establish the existence of an optimal percentile mechanism and characterize it via a system of

The system designer aims to minimize system cost by considering the prosumers' strategic token allocation between blockchain staking and energy purchase for their applications. This is challenging as the system designer does not know prosumers' private information of impatience levels towards different applications. To this end, we propose an online learning mechanism (OLM), which includes incentive mechanisms to guide both prosumers' private information reporting and staking decisions in two phases. In the exploration phase, we design a randomized staking reward to encourage prosumers' truthful reporting of their private information for the learning of impatience level distributions. Based on the threshold structure of the prosumers' equilibrium staking strategies, in the exploitation phase, we propose a learning-error-based reward to minimize the system cost considering the finite-sample bias. By characterizing the optimal exploration duration, we prove that OLM achieves an asymptotic zero-regret against the complete information benchmark, with the regret bounded by [EQUATION] when operating for T time slots. We implement the corresponding smart contract in Ethereum to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.

Therefore, this paper proposes a truthful auction mechanism that efficiently allocates unused Wi-Fi channels, prioritizing users based on latency needs. The proposed framework enables seamless coexistence between Wi-Fi and 5G/6G systems in unlicensed spectrum environments by utilizing a Decentralized Channel Administration Database (DCAD) to manage airtime allocation. This ensures that latency-sensitive applications are adequately supported while minimizing interference at receivers. Additionally, the framework integrates a Q-learning-based optimization mechanism, leveraging model-free Reinforcement Learning to allocate spectrum resources dynamically. Simulation results validate the solution’s effectiveness, demonstrating enhanced user utility, reduced interference at receivers, and scalable spectrum management.

The efficiency of pharmaceutical integrity supervision is closely linked to government oversight mechanisms and the behaviors of third-party testing agencies. This study constructs an evolutionary game model that incorporates rent-seeking dynamics and introduces a reward-punishment mechanism, integrating drug production enterprises, third-party testing agencies, government regulators, and drug wholesale enterprises. By solving for the stable equilibrium points of each participant’s strategic choices and analyzing the stability of strategy combinations using Lyapunov’s first method, the study employs Matlab 2022b for simulation analysis to verify the impact of various decision variables on the strategic choices of different entities. The findings reveal that: 1) The rejection of rent-seeking by third-party testing agencies enhances the incentives for drug production enterprises to operate with integrity, indicating that the government should increase penalties for accepting rent-seeking behavior. 2) Drug wholesale enterprises’ reporting likelihood increases production enterprises’ integrity and third-party testing agencies’ rejection of rent-seeking, inversely tied to reporting costs. 3) Reducing the costs of stringent government supervision and increasing the speculative costs of rent-seeking for third-party testing agencies help prevent dishonest practices among drug production enterprises. 4) A well-designed reward and punishment mechanism facilitates a synergistic environment of government supervision, self-discipline among pharmaceutical enterprises, and social harmony.

The Bulow-Klemberer theorem proposes that expanding the number of participants is a more effective approach to increase revenue than modifying the auction format. However, agents lack the motivation to invite others because doing so intensifies competition among them. On the other hand, misreporting social networks is also a common problem that can reduce revenue. Examples of misreporting include Sybil attacks (an agent pretending to be multiple bidders) and coalition groups (multiple agents pretending to be an agent). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel mechanism called the Truthful Referral Diffusion Mechanism (TRDM). TRDM incentivizes agents to report their social networks truthfully, and some of them are rewarded by the seller for improving revenue. In spite of the fact that some agents overbid in TRDM, the revenue is fixed, and it is higher than the revenue of any mechanism without referrals. TRDM is budget-balanced (non-negative revenue) and generates an efficient outcome (maximized social welfare), making it attractive for both the seller and the buyers as it improves revenue and reward.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbc78464df732fd2687ae0a54150ca55a17858a1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08135,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbc78464df732fd2687ae0a54150ca55a17858a1,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",0,9fbbe3d4ae0f6aa101cdc1c9f58c024d,10.48550/arXiv.2302.08135,2302.08135,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Drawing from real-world large-scale Agile transformation programs, including evidence from Visa’s enterprise initiatives, the paper introduces a governance framework designed to align distributed stakeholders, streamline risk management, and improve portfolio-level delivery consistency. The research outlines mechanisms for shared planning, tooling integration, and synchronized oversight that enable organizations to deliver predictable value while preserving Agile flexibility. 
Key transformation barriers—such as fragmented communication, inconsistent development maturity, and vendor accountability—are examined alongside mitigation practices. The framework promotes continuous improvement, harmonized delivery cadences, and performance tracking across diverse technical and organizational boundaries. 
This paper contributes a practical roadmap for executives and program managers leading multi-vendor Agile transformations, emphasizing that success lies not just in implementing Agile methods but in adapting governance to the realities of scale and complexity. It advances both theoretical understanding and actionable strategy for cross-functional alignment, delivery resilience, and scalable Agile adoption.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7705fe03c1e3936f5b8c137ba2d94e2a77da8e0b,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7705fe03c1e3936f5b8c137ba2d94e2a77da8e0b,International Journal of Applied Mathematics,"Business, Computer Science, Engineering",0,080763f1063a383eed9b37269a38802b,10.12732/ijam.v38i2s.75,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Business'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Jhaveri, Abegaz Mohammed Seid, Aiman M. Erbad",2025,"Federated learning-based model marketplaces have the potential to securely leverage healthcare data for efficient healthcare transactions. However, the willingness to participate in this marketplace is severely hindered by self-interested model sellers, who maximize their personal gains via distorting the quality of their models. To this end, we propose a reputation-driven hierarchical incentive mechanism, called PACE, which combines contract cooperation and game pricing to motivate model sellers to be honest, thereby improving the sustainability of the model marketplace via two-layer cooperation. Specifically, at the training layer, we design a reward payment rule based on multidimensional contracts, while at the trading layer, we use a competitive market pricing game to develop the accuracy pricing rule. In particular, the above rules cleverly combine the fine-grained model sellers’ reputations with the willingness of healthcare devices to indirectly affect the model sellers’ utilities. Theoretically, we prove that PACE can effectively incentivize model sellers to truthfully report model quality while satisfying both individual rationality and incentive compatibility with a fairness guarantee. Experimental results conducted on four real-world datasets show that our PACE improves the global performance by up to 12.85% and reduces the global loss by at least 19.23% compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/795e2172fc4b77ce24f9abadaeef1d18637bdd3f,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/795e2172fc4b77ce24f9abadaeef1d18637bdd3f,IEEE transactions on consumer electronics,"Computer Science, Medicine, Computer Science",0,893ede1b6d458174868e6238fb328e74,10.1109/TCE.2024.3510732,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

The proposed system replaces traditional manual processes with a streamlined, automated framework that enhances data accuracy, operational efficiency, and user experience. Developed primarily for librarians and library administrators, the system facilitates seamless management of key modules including book maintenance, member records, issue/return tracking, and lost book handling. Additionally, administrative users are granted access to staff management and comprehensive reporting functionalities for operational analytics.The LMS is designed as a web-based platform, offering centralized control over library resources and enabling real-time updates to book status and user interactions. The system significantly reduces the overhead associated with manual operations, minimizes human errors, and improves resource utilization by incorporating automated validation and modular design. Unlike conventional library systems, this model identifies and addresses limitations such as the absence of One-Time Password (OTP) authentication, lack of automated due-date reminders, and the non-integration of smart card access.To ensure future readiness, the system architecture allows scalability for advanced features such as OTP-based user verification, SMS/email reminders for overdue books, and smart card-based user identification.

Ozele",2024,"This study investigates the moderating effect of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the relationship between corporate governance, specifically ownership structure, and financial reporting quality in listed non-finance firms in Nigeria. Utilizing an ex-post facto research design, the study drew its data from 67 non-finance firms listed on the Nigerian Exchange Group over a ten-year period (2012-2021). The study employs purposive sampling and hierarchical regression analysis to explore the complex connection between IFRS adoption and ownership structures, revealing that IFRS plays a significant role in enhancing the quality of financial reporting. The findings indicate that while ownership concentration may weaken financial reporting quality in the absence of IFRS, the adoption of IFRS significantly moderates this effect, leading to improved transparency and reduced earnings manipulation. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence from a less developed market context, emphasizing the critical interaction between global accounting standards and corporate governance mechanisms. The study concludes that robust enforcement of IFRS compliance, combined with targeted capacity building for financial professionals, is essential to ensure high-quality financial reporting in Nigeria.

However, in real-world applications such as school choice and residency matching, preferences are revealed after capacity decisions are made, with matching occurring afterward; uncertainty about agents'preferences must be considered during capacity planning. Moreover, even under strategy-proof mechanisms, agents may strategically misreport preferences based on beliefs about admission chances. We introduce a two-stage stochastic matching problem with uncertain preferences, using school choice as a case study. In the first stage, the clearinghouse expands schools'capacities before observing students'reported preferences. Students either report their true preferences, producing exogenous uncertainty, or act strategically, submitting reported preferences based on their true preferences and admission chances (which depend on capacities), introducing endogenous uncertainty. In the second stage, the clearinghouse computes the student-optimal stable matching based on schools'priorities and students'reported preferences. In strategic cases, endogenous reported preferences are utility-maximizing transformations of capacity decisions and exogenous true preferences; we handle uncertainty using sample average approximation(SAA). We develop behavior-based mathematical formulations and, due to problem complexity, propose Lagrangian- and local-search-based behavior-specific heuristics for near-optimal solutions. Our SAA-based approaches outperform the average scenario approach on students'matching preferences and admission outcomes, emphasizing the impact of stochastic preferences on capacity decisions. Student behavior notably influences capacity design, stressing the need to consider misreports.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e2d25419b8921e313d3598507c7ff89aef38b20,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22560.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1e2d25419b8921e313d3598507c7ff89aef38b20,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics",0,a7ab36678d781cd5605a652714d6e460,10.48550/arXiv.2506.22560,2506.22560,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost $\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le B,S\subseteq U\}$. Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular, and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of items.

However, since these tools must be employed in secret, it can be challenging to identify abuses or changes in use that could be of significant public interest. In this paper, we evaluate this phenomenon in the context of National Security Letters (NSLs). NSLs are a form of legal process that empowers parts of the United States federal government to request certain pieces of information for national security purposes. After initial concerns about the lack of public oversight, Congress worked to increase transparency by mandating government agencies to publish aggregated statistics on the NSL usage and by allowing the private sector to report information on NSLs in transparency reports. The implicit goal is that these transparency mechanisms should deter large-scale abuse by making it visible. We evaluate how well these mechanisms work by carefully analyzing the full range of publicly available data related to NSL use. Our findings suggest that they may not lead to the desired public scrutiny as we find published information requires significant manual effort to collect and parse data due to the lack of structure and context. Moreover, we discovered mistakes (subsequently fixed after our reporting to the ODNI), which suggests a lack of active auditing.

Jaillet",2025,"We study a repeated resource allocation problem with strategic agents where monetary transfers are disallowed and the central planner has no prior information on agents' utility distributions. In light of Arrow's impossibility theorem, acquiring information about agent preferences through some form of feedback is necessary. We assume that the central planner can request powerful but expensive audits on the winner in any round, revealing the true utility of the winner in that round. We design a mechanism achieving $T$-independent $O(K^2)$ social welfare regret while only requesting $O(K^3 \log T)$ audits in expectation, where $K$ is the number of agents and $T$ is the number of rounds. We also show an $\Omega(K)$ lower bound on the regret and an $\Omega(1)$ lower bound on the number of audits when having low regret. Algorithmically, we show that incentive-compatibility can be mostly enforced via the imposition of adaptive future punishments, where the audit probability is inversely proportional to the winner's future winning probability. To accurately estimate such probabilities in presence of strategic agents, who may adversely react to any potential misestimate, we introduce a flagging component that allows agents to flag any biased estimate (we show that doing so aligns with individual incentives). On the technical side, without a unique and known distribution, one cannot apply the revelation principle and conclude that truthful reporting is exactly an equilibrium. Instead, we characterize the equilibrium via a reduction to a simpler auxiliary game, in which agents cannot strategize until close to the end of the game; we show equilibria in this game can induce equilibria in the actual, fully strategic game. The tools developed therein may be of independent interest for other mechanism design problems in which the revelation principle cannot be readily applied.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/482e6201291b22e1f46ab9a922da9a40b7a18589,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08412.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/482e6201291b22e1f46ab9a922da9a40b7a18589,Annual Conference Computational Learning Theory,"Computer Science, Economics, Economics",0,cbdc7c6da50df5788e6c1f2b327b4873,10.48550/arXiv.2502.08412,2502.08412,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Chung",2025,"The proliferation of flexible loads has empowered residential users in contributing both upward and downward frequency regulation reserves to the power grid. Due to barriers like minimum bid size, residential users with relatively small power consumption must be aggregated before they can enter the reserve market. However, the large number of residential users renders the aggregation mechanism design problem a challenging task. In particular, the cost for reserve provision of each user is not only highly heterogeneous, but also coupled through both the temporal dimension and the up/down regulation direction. In order to allow the users to fully express their costs, in this paper, we propose a combinatorial reverse auction (CRA) framework as the market mechanism for user aggregation. In this auction, the aggregator is the auctioneer and procures reserves from residential users. The users submit package bids consisting of combinations of both upward and downward reserves over multiple time-slots, capturing the coupling in the user cost. Furthermore, to address the infamous computational challenges of large-scale combinatorial auctions, we develop a novel fast combinatorial auction (FCA) mechanism that can be solved in polynomial time. It includes an approximate winner determination algorithm and a critical payment scheme. Notably, our proposed mechanism is rigorously proved to possess desirable economic properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality. Extensive simulations have validated the theoretic properties of the proposed CRA mechanism and its advantages over existing methods. In particular, compared with the widely employed truthful Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, CRA can be $10^{4}$ times faster than VCG when the user number is above 1000. Meanwhile, it is able to achieve near-optimal social cost, where the average optimality loss is 2.92%.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3b840774a258d3841682bed76014a9ac5bea22e,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3b840774a258d3841682bed76014a9ac5bea22e,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,"Engineering, Economics, Computer Science",0,a1b364ca75b34a2cc862b18cfebf95b8,10.1109/TSTE.2024.3479451,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

This paper considers the set-up with multiple task requesters and several task executors in a strategic setting. Each task requester has multiple heterogeneous tasks and an estimated budget for the tasks. In our proposed model, the Government has a publicly known fund (or budget) and is limited. Due to limited funds, it may not be possible for the platform to offer the funds to all the available task requesters. For that purpose, in the first tier, the voting by the city dwellers over the task requesters is carried out to decide on the subset of task requesters receiving the Government fund. In the second tier, each task of the task requesters has start and finish times. Based on that, firstly, the tasks are distributed to distinct slots. In each slot, we have multiple task executors for executing the floated tasks. Each task executor reports a cost (private) for completing the floated task(s). Given the above-discussed set-up, the objectives of the second tier are: (1) to schedule each task of the task requesters in the available slots in a non-conflicting manner and (2) to select a set of executors for the available tasks in such a way that the total incentive given to the task executors should be at most the budget for the tasks. For the discussed scenario, a truthful incentive based mechanism is designed that also takes care of budget criteria. Theoretical analysis is done, and it shows that the proposed mechanism is computationally efficient, truthful, budget-feasible, and individually rational. The simulation is carried out, and the efficacy of the designed mechanism is compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f025878598be183e617af33ebce677ec9aa292c,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10206.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f025878598be183e617af33ebce677ec9aa292c,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",0,46b6610c2e3bee703fb4ad6f2cf1b8e5,10.48550/arXiv.2405.10206,2405.10206,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00,2025-09-30 00:48:00.124992+00:00

Given oracle access to an algorithm for an underlying optimization problem, the goal is to simulate an incentive compatible mechanism. The mechanism will be evaluated on its expected welfare, relative to the algorithm provided, and its complexity is measured by the time (and queries) needed to simulate the mechanism on any input. While it is known that black-box reductions are not possible in many prior-free settings, settings with priors appear more promising: there are known reductions for Bayesian incentive compatible (BIC) mechanism design for general classes of welfare maximization problems. This dichotomy begs the question: which mechanism design problems admit black-box reductions, and which do not? Our main result is that black-box mechanism design is impossible under two of the simplest settings not captured by known positive results. First, for the problem of allocating n goods to a single buyer whose valuation is additive and independent across the goods, subject to a downward-closed constraint on feasible allocations, we show that there is no polytime (in n) BIC black-box reduction for expected welfare maximization. Second, for the setting of multiple single-parameter agents—where polytime BIC reductions are known—we show that no polytime reductions exist when the incentive requirement is tightened to Max-In-Distributional-Range. In each case, we show that achieving a sub-polynomial approximation to the expected welfare requires exponentially many queries, even when the set of feasible allocations is known to be downward-closed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cfd8ab989f9f96265c0e3ca4cd91266273e0273,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10794,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cfd8ab989f9f96265c0e3ca4cd91266273e0273,ACM Trans.

Xue",2022,"Payment channel networks (PCNs) are proposed to improve the cryptocurrency scalability by settling off-chain transactions. However, a significant barrier is that a PCN user must solicit sufficient capital owned by the counterparty on its channel (i.e., inbound liquidity) to receive payments. To alleviate this inbound liquidity problem, Channel Liquidity Marketplaces (CLMs), e.g., Bitcoin's Lightning Pool, have been introduced, such that users can buy and sell inbound liquidity by trading crypto capital commitment in PCNs. Existing CLMs lack good incentive mechanisms that can attract more user participation. To fulfill this void, we design Cumulonimbus, an incentive mechanism for trading crypto capital commitment, which satisfies truthfulness, individual rationality, budget balance, and computational efficiency. Particularly, Cumulonimbus considers two unique features of crypto capital commitment, referred to as demand indivisibility and supply divisibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that Cumulonimbus achieves higher satisfaction ratio, liquidity utilization, and social welfare compared with a state-of-the-art CLM mechanism Lightning Pool [18].",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c29afebe0c7e2f1f2008a94261efffc5094728f,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c29afebe0c7e2f1f2008a94261efffc5094728f,ICC 2022 - IEEE International Conference on Communications,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Economics",0,c4d845d8646edbc7be2dd3258e103710,10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838590,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

Instead, each buyer reports and commits to a bid distribution in the ex-ante stage, which the auctioneer uses as input to the mechanism. Buyers strategically decide the reported distributions to maximize ex-ante utility, potentially deviating from their value distributions. As shown in previous work, classical prior-dependent mechanisms such as the Myerson auction fail to elicit truthful value distributions at the ex-ante stage, despite satisfying Bayesian incentive compatibility at the interim stage. We study the design of ex-ante incentive compatible mechanisms, and aim to maximize revenue in a prior-independent approximation framework. We introduce a family of threshold-augmented mechanisms, which ensures ex-ante incentive compatibility while boosting revenue through ex-ante thresholds. Based on these mechanisms, we construct the Peer-Max Mechanism, which achieves an either-or approximation guarantee for general non-identical distributions. Specifically, for any value distributions, its expected revenue either achieves a constant fraction of the optimal social welfare, or surpasses the second-price revenue by a constant fraction, where the constants depend on the number of buyers and a tunable parameter. We also provide an upper bound on the revenue achievable by any ex-ante incentive compatible mechanism, matching our lower bound up to a constant factor.

However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however, not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be8b9b26615b2c173ba4b6e8ff02e14b082707ab,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22507.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be8b9b26615b2c173ba4b6e8ff02e14b082707ab,,"Computer Science, Computer Science",0,afb2c9b7a319138eca89ce71768fde8b,,2509.22507,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00,2025-09-30 00:47:49.908057+00:00

The proposed design is a single-piece mechanism that is produced from polypropylene and compatible with both additive manufacturing and injection molding techniques. The scalability of compliant mechanisms allows for a wide range of size options during the design process. An extensive survey of the current literature reveals that the design proposed is without precedent, marking it as both novel and inventive. In this study, the design procedure of the proposed universal joint, stress analysis of the links, the torque capacity of the joint, and an experimental setup are presented. The produced prototype demonstrates the functionality of the proposed design. In addition, it should be noted that the prototype production of the proposed design was conducted using the additive manufacturing method.

We propose a novel incentive model that leverages both monetary rewards and reputation-based strategies to encourage honest participation, resource sharing, and collaborative learning. The model considers factors such as computational power, data quality, and energy consumption to distribute rewards fairly among participants. Additionally, we investigate the trade-offs between global model performance and the cost of incentivization, aiming to find a balance that ensures long-term sustainability and scalability. Through simulations and theoretical analysis, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism and highlight its potential impact on the adoption of federated learning in real-world multi-cloud environments.

Approaches to scaling AI supervision include debate, in which two agents engage in structured dialogue to help a judge evaluate claims; critique, in which models identify potential flaws in proposed solutions; and prover-verifier games, in which a capable 'prover' model generates solutions that must be verifiable by a less capable 'verifier'. Evaluations of the scalability of these and similar approaches to difficult problems benefit from datasets that include (1) long-form expert-verified correct solutions and (2) long-form flawed solutions with annotations highlighting specific errors, but few are available. To address this gap, we present FindTheFlaws, a group of five diverse datasets spanning medicine, mathematics, science, coding, and the Lojban language. Each dataset contains questions and long-form solutions with expert annotations validating their correctness or identifying specific error(s) in the reasoning. We evaluate frontier models' critiquing capabilities and observe a range of performance that can be leveraged for scalable oversight experiments: models performing more poorly on particular datasets can serve as judges/verifiers for more capable models. Additionally, for some task/dataset combinations, expert baselines exceed even top model performance, making them more beneficial for scalable oversight experiments.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87362d2f42a4b72de95787763b896540b7e6d80a,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22989.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87362d2f42a4b72de95787763b896540b7e6d80a,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science",0,4e5e7b076be8a123a53ca6f6211e9e2f,10.48550/arXiv.2503.22989,2503.22989,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Yet as AI systems grow more capable, human feedback becomes increasingly unreliable. This raises the problem of scalable oversight: How can we supervise AI systems that exceed human capabilities? In this work, we propose to model the human evaluator's beliefs about the AI system's behavior to better interpret the human's feedback. We formalize human belief models and theoretically analyze their role in inferring human values. We then characterize the remaining ambiguity in this inference and conditions for which the ambiguity disappears. To mitigate reliance on exact belief models, we then introduce the relaxation of human belief model covering.

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Nursing Home (CNH) program provides in-person oversight monitoring the quality of care of veterans in VA-contracted community-based skilled nursing homes. The number of veterans receiving CNH care is projected to increase by 80% by 2037.


Methods
Retrospective observational data describing the distance between contracted facilities and VA medical centers (VAMCs) were linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid monthly Nursing Home Compare and Brown University Long Term Care: Facts on Care in the US data. Qualitative interviews with CNH-based staff and VA-based CNH program oversight team members were conducted using a semistructured interview guide. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed independently and integrated during the interpretation of results.


Results
The number of CNHs per VAMC ranged from 1 to 68 (mean, 18). One in 4 CNHs were > 70 miles from the associated VAMC; among CNHs with 2 to 5 veterans, 44% were located > 50 miles away. Four qualitative themes emerged regarding VA CNH oversight: (1) benefits of VA CNH team engagement/ visits, including quality assurance and care coordination; (2) burden of VA CNH oversight due to geographic dispersion with too few or too many veterans at each to achieve efficiency; (3) oversight burdens and limited staffing restricted ability to add CNHs; and (4) remote access and interoperability of electronic health records and balancing the number of CNH veterans with staffing could facilitate successful oversight.


Conclusions
The success of the CNH program will depend on the exchange of information and matching available resources to veterans' needs. At a time when strategies to ease the burden on NHs and VA CNH coordinators are needed, the VA needs to improve to properly scale the program.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5386211bb8456641d6979f2e7a2bb789e4b87259,https://cdn.mdedge.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/fdp04010338.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5386211bb8456641d6979f2e7a2bb789e4b87259,"Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS","Medicine, Medicine",0,b0cebcc908764fb95e3a53cd226945a0,10.12788/fp.0421,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:58.124675+00:00

Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that causes the gradual deterioration of cognitive abilities, presents considerable difficulties in accurately diagnosing and interpreting brain imaging, particularly in the early stages. Neural-enhance Style Transfer (NST), once recognized in the creative field for its capacity to combine the styles of many images, is currently being adapted to improve the clarity and comprehensibility of brain scans used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease. The scalability of this technology is incredibly revolutionary in managing the immense amount of neuroimaging data. In addition, this method also includes the transfer of stylistic characteristics from high-resolution, annotated brain MRIs to broader sets of standard scans, which often need to be clarified and defined. Such enhancement greatly enhances important characteristics, such as brain networks and regions of degeneration, which are essential for the early identification of Alzheimer’s disease. An exemplary use of NST in this field has shown a significant enhancement in the discernibility of brain microstructures, vital for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. This improvement has resulted in a considerable rise of over 25% in the accuracy of detecting first pathological alterations.

For instance, AI could create highly personalized learning pathways, but this might conflict with educators’ intentions for structured skill development. This paper proposes a framework to address this paradox, focusing on four key principles: ethics, robustness, interpretability, and scalable oversight. We examine the current landscape of AI in medical education, highlighting its potential to enhance learning experiences, improve clinical decision making, and personalize education. We review ethical considerations, emphasize the importance of robustness across diverse healthcare settings, and present interpretability as crucial for effective human–AI collaboration. For example, AI-based feedback systems like i-SIDRA enable real-time, actionable feedback, enhancing interpretability while reducing cognitive overload. The concept of scalable oversight is introduced to maintain human control while leveraging AI’s autonomy.

We find no overall advantage for the tested protocols, although in Study 1, showing arguments in favor of both answers improves accuracy in cases where the model is incorrect. In Study 2, participants in both groups become more confident in the system's answers after conducting online research, even when those answers are incorrect.

To counteract these issues, researchers have proposed blockchain-based solutions for enhanced data protection. This research work highlights an innovative approach utilizing the services of Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a secure and encrypted connection framework accessible via web browsers that supports global data storage and distribution on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. This model ensures privacy, accuracy of information, and eliminates additional service fees or software requirements. However, even decentralized networks like IPFS have faced cyber threats compromising user data. In response to this challenge, the presented research outlines a model incorporating AES-256 encryption to protect files before uploading them onto IPFS nodes. Secure transmission is achieved through WebRTC technology which facilitates the exchange of encrypted file hashes and keys with recipients. The key takeaways from this study include an optimized method for file storage and distribution designed to thwart cyber-attacks targeting stored or shared files while also providing economic benefits by removing extra storage costs associated with large files in centralized systems.

By letting humans correct high-impact errors once, the verified memory acts as a frozen safety contract that future agent actions must satisfy.

The thermal decomposition of polymers plays a key role in various fields, such as waste recycling and energy recovery, and in the development of new materials. The objective of this study is to model the degradation kinetics using thermogravimetric data, matrix-based numerical methods, and quantum chemical calculations. To solve the resulting systems of linear algebraic equations (SLAEs), matrix decomposition algorithms (QR, SVD, and Cholesky) were employed, which enabled the determination of activation energy values for the process. Comparison of the activation energy (Ea) results obtained using the decomposition method of Cholesky (207.21 kJ/mol), normal equations (205.22 kJ/mol), singular value decomposition (206.23 kJ/mol), and QR decomposition (206.23 kJ/mol) showed minor changes that were associated with the features of each method. Quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were performed to analyze the molecular structure and interpret the IR spectra. This study establishes that the content of functional groups (ether and ester) and the type of chemical bonds exert critical influences on the decomposition mechanism and associated thermal parameters. The results confirm that the polymer’s structural architecture governs its thermal stability.

Papalexakis",2025,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

House, Jessica W. Tsai",2025,"Two decades after the human genome, prediction in cancer remains limited. The entire multi-ome affects the disease. And, unlike typical artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), e.g., neural networks and deep learning, our multi-tensor AI/ML is uniquely able to identify predictors from multi-omic clinical data. We have been developing the algorithms, i.e., the “multi-tensor comparative spectral decompositions,” to extend the mathematics that underlies quantum mechanics to overcome the limitations of typical AI/ML. We demonstrated the algorithms in the discovery and validation of novel predictors of survival and response to treatment in, e.g., astrocytoma, including glioblastoma (GBM), brain, lung, nerve, ovarian, and uterine cancers.
 The algorithms, first, blindly, i.e., without any assumptions or a-priori knowledge, removed batch effects and separated demographic variations from the data. This enabled identifying, e.g., a predictor in ovarian cancer, which is encompassed within the normally varying X chromosome. Second, the algorithms identified the predictors repeatedly, in federated and imbalanced public datasets from as few as 50-100 patients each, showing that the algorithms are batch- and demographics-agnostic, and the predictors are actionable in the general population. Third, the predictors were interpreted in terms of known and new disease mechanisms and drug targets and combinations of targets to sensitize the tumors to the treatment. The predictors are independent from all standard-of-care indicators, additionally showing that this information that they contain was missing from the understanding and management of cancer. Fourth, the GBM predictor, which is the first biomarker to encompass the whole genome, was prospectively and retrospectively experimentally validated to be the most accurate and precise. All other attempts to associate a GBM tumor’s DNA copy numbers with the patient’s outcome failed. For 70 years, the best indicator has remained age at diagnosis, establishing that the algorithms find what all others miss, and the predictors outperform all others where they exist.
 Here, we present recent experiments demonstrating that, fifth, the GBM predictor correctly identified previously unrecognized drug targets, i.e., genes that are required for the tumor’s cell proliferation and viability, further validating the mechanistic interpretability of the multi-tensor AI/ML. Guide RNAs were designed and a lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 all-in-one vector was harnessed to knock out the candidate genes. Knockout validation at the protein level was performed using Western blot. Knockout in patient-derived GBM cell lines resulted in significantly attenuated cell viability and proliferation.
 We conclude that our multi-tensor AI/ML is uniquely suited for personalized medicine.

This study presents a comprehensive data-driven framework to analyze the spatiotemporal interplay between metro and dockless bikesharing usage using real-world data from Tianjin, China. Two primary methods are employed: K-means clustering is used to categorize metro stations and bike usage zones based on temporal demand features, and non-negative Tucker decomposition is applied to a three-way tensor (day, hour, station) to extract latent mobility modes. These modes capture recurrent commuting and leisure behaviors, and their alignment across modes is assessed using Jaccard similarity indices. Our findings reveal distinct usage typologies, including mismatched (misalignment of jobs and residences), employment-oriented, and comprehensive zones, and highlight strong temporal coordination between metro and bikesharing during peak hours, contrasted by spatial divergence during off-peak periods. The analysis also uncovers asymmetries in peripheral stations, suggesting differentiated planning needs.

 Accurate calculation of the space charge force inside charged particle beams is of practical concern for a deep understanding of the dynamical evolution of beams propagating in accelerators, especially for high-intensity machines. Many computational schemes have been well developed for space charge calculation. Conventional matrix-based methods are primarily suited for the two-dimensional (2-D) space charge calculation. However, one major limitation of such methods is that for the three dimensional (3-D) case, the matrix representation becomes much more complicated. In this paper, we propose a new method via tensor representation on a discretized 3-D map for space charge calculation. With the utilization of the n-mode product of tensors (orthogonal basis), the 3-D Poisson equation can be solved by a concise manner for not only rectangular domain, but also non-rectangular case.

Conversely, canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition maintains efficiency but lacks a precise statistical interpretation. To attain both interpretability and powerful dimension reduction, this paper proposes a novel approach under the supervised factor modeling paradigm, which first uses CP decomposition to extract response and covariate features separately and then regresses response features on covariate ones. This leads to a new CP-based low-rank structure for the coefficient tensor. Furthermore, to address heterogeneous signals or potential model misspecifications arising from stringent low-rank assumptions, a low-rank plus sparse model is introduced by incorporating an additional sparse coefficient tensor. Nonasymptotic properties are established for the ordinary least squares estimators, and an alternating least squares algorithm is introduced for optimization.

Kountchev",2022,"A tensor representation structure based on the multilayer tensor spectrum pyramid (MLTSP) is introduced in this work. The structure is “truncated”, i.e., part of the high-frequency spectrum coefficients is cut-off, and on the retained low-frequency coefficients, obtained at the output of each pyramid layer, a hierarchical tensor SVD (HTSVD) is applied. This ensures a high concentration of the input tensor energy into a small number of decomposition components of the tensors obtained at the coder output. The implementation of this idea is based on a symmetrical coder/decoder. An example structure for a cubical tensor of size 8 × 8 × 8, which is represented as a two-layer tensor spectrum pyramid, where 3D frequency-ordered fast Walsh–Hadamard transform and HTSVD are used, is given in this paper. The analysis of the needed mathematical operations proved the low computational complexity of the new approach, due to a lack of iterative calculations. The high flexibility of the structure in respect to the number of pyramid layers, the kind of used orthogonal transforms, the number of retained spectrum coefficients, and HTSVD components, permits us to achieve the desired accuracy of the restored output tensor, imposed by the application. Furthermore, this paper presents one possible application for 3D object searches in a tensor database.

The method combines Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) to extract low-dimensional temporal features from multi-way electricity usage data, with a Genetic Algorithm that optimizes the hyperparameters of time series models applied to the latent annual factors. We model the dataset as a third-order tensor spanning electric utilities, industrial sectors, and years, and apply canonical polyadic decomposition under non-negativity constraints. The annual component is forecasted using autoregressive models, with hyperparameter tuning guided by the prediction error or reconstruction accuracy on a validation set. Comparative experiments using real-world electricity data from Japan demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower mean squared error than baseline approaches without tensor decomposition or evolutionary optimization. Moreover, we find that reducing the model's degrees of freedom via tensor decomposition improves generalization performance, and that initialization sensitivity in NTF can be mitigated through multiple runs or ensemble strategies. These findings suggest that the proposed framework offers an interpretable, flexible, and scalable approach to long-term electricity demand prediction and can be extended to other structured time series forecasting tasks.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9ce847ba907246c7cedeb47d13729ef7c550a3d,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22132.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9ce847ba907246c7cedeb47d13729ef7c550a3d,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Engineering, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Economics",0,32fa563743737c115d54188f2e26812b,10.48550/arXiv.2503.22132,2503.22132,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Economics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

In this position paper, we offer a perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks. These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic interpretability.

 Prediction in cancer remains limited, and drugs continue to fail clinical trials and post-market validation. The entire multi-ome affects the disease, but typical artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) cannot generate predictors from multi-omic clinical data. Because, first, the data are “skinny, ” with orders of magnitude more features than samples. Neural networks and deep learning, e.g., would require ≥3B-patient sets to generate models from the 3B-nucleotide genome alone. Second, batch and demographic variations mask the disease-specific patterns. Third, unavoidable imbalances and unavailable labels obscure the distinctions among subpopulations. Fourth, accuracy and interpretability are usually traded off, but (pre)clinical models need to accommodate both. Fifth, the data are of different types, numbers, and dimensions.
 Our multi-tensor AI/ML is uniquely able to identify accurate, precise, actionable, and mechanistically interpretable predictors from multi-omic clinical data. We have been developing the algorithms, i.e., the “multi-tensor comparative spectral decompositions, ” to extend the mathematics that underlies quantum mechanics to overcome the limitations of typical AI/ML. We demonstrated the algorithms in the discovery and validation of predictors in, e.g., astrocytoma, including glioblastoma (GBM), brain, lung, nerve, ovarian, and uterine cancers. The algorithms identified the predictors repeatedly, in federated and imbalanced public datasets from as few as 50-100 patients each. The GBM predictor, the first to encompass the whole genome and the first to associate a GBM tumor’s DNA copy-number alterations with the patient’s outcome, was additionally prospectively and retrospectively experimentally validated to be the most accurate and precise predictor of survival and response to treatment. Recent experiments also show that the GBM predictor correctly identified previously unrecognized drug targets, i.e., genes that are required for the tumor’s cell proliferation and viability.
 Here, we demonstrate the multi-tensor AI/ML in the discovery and validation of whole-transcriptome predictors of survival in response to atezolizumab PD-L1 inhibitor immunotherapy. The predictors were discovered in pre-treatment metastatic disease profiles from an open-source clinical trial, and validated in primary disease profiles from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). One predictor is additionally correlated with the response to the treatment, and the other - with the tissue of metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards models show that the two predictors outperform the best indicator of response to atezolizumab to date, i.e., tumor mutation burden (TMB).
 We conclude that our multi-tensor AI/ML is uniquely suited for personalized medicine.

Such systems often involve nonlinear feedbacks, delays, and interactions across scales. Classical modeling derives explicit governing equations, often systems of differential equations, by combining mechanistic assumptions, experimental observations, and known physical laws. The growing complexity of biological processes has, however, motivated complementary data-driven methods that aim to infer model structure directly from measurements, often without specifying equations a priori. In this review, we survey approaches for model discovery in biological dynamical systems, focusing on three methodological families: regression-based methods, network-based architectures, and decomposition techniques. We compare their ability to address three core goals: forecasting future states, identifying interactions, and characterizing system states. Representative methods are applied to a common benchmark, the Oregonator model, a minimal nonlinear oscillator that captures shared design principles of chemical and biological systems.

Wollner, Kathrin Welker",2025,"In this work, we investigate a novel approach for the simulation of two-dimensional, brittle, quasi-static fracture problems based on a shape optimization approach. In contrast to the commonly-used phase-field approach, this proposed approach for investigating fracture paths does not require a specified `length-scale'parameter defining the diffuse interface region nor a level set function. Instead, it interprets the fracture as part of the boundary of the domain and uses shape optimization algorithms to minimize the energy in the system and therefore describes the fracture propagation directly. Embedding the problem of energy minimization in a Riemannian manifold framework formulated on a suitable shape space, together with the choice of an outer Riemannian metric, yields both advantages from an analytical as well as an applied perspective. Furthermore, an eigenvalue decomposition of the strain tensor is used to produce more realistic fracture paths (the so-called strain splitting), which only allows fracture growth from tensile loads. Numerical simulations for the commonly considered single-edge notch tension and shear test are performed and the results are evaluated in comparison to phase-field results.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5ec60c83ea788e521db39e0c55359c77060c566,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19112.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5ec60c83ea788e521db39e0c55359c77060c566,,"Mathematics, Engineering, Physics",0,fecd2e442258e82d9a380a68f049ab7e,,2507.19112,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Dimethylsilanediol (DMSD), while not sold commercially, has been demonstrated to be a degradation product of methylsiloxane polymers and volatile methylsiloxanes (VMS) in the environment. Polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) and VMS enter the soil compartment when biosolids from wastewater treatment are applied for soil amendment. Understanding the fate and transport of DMSD in soil is important for understanding the ultimate fate of methylsiloxanes. Recently published experimental studies in bare soil and plant-soil systems have significantly advanced the understanding of the fate of DMSD. The results supported the upward transport of DMSD to top surface soil along with pore water during dry periods, its volatilization into the air phase at the soil surface, and its phytovolatilization via transpiration through plants. However, a more systematic understanding was needed to interpret the data using mechanistic models. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: i) develop mathematical models for DMSD movement in soil systems, ii) optimize the model parameters using recent experimental data, and iii) test the models with varying parameters under different environmental conditions to evaluate DMSD movement in soils. Our models predicted DMSD concentrations and movements that were in good agreement with the experimental results frompreviously reported column studies in bare soil and soil-plant systems. Sensitivity analyses reveal the key factors governing hydraulic conductivity, DMSD vs water transport and rate of DMSD transfer to air are soil texture, KOC and KOA, respectively. The impact of plants on DMSD removal to air is also discussed. In the future, we hope to use this model in combination with experimental data to better understand the fate of DMSD in the environment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012cc7583b09d408bde04cc6c10754c95d4658e6,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012cc7583b09d408bde04cc6c10754c95d4658e6,Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management,"Medicine, Environmental Science, Chemistry",0,8fc8a8dbf9aeefd953acc7a7a7e00032,10.1093/inteam/vjaf072,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Chemistry'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

Based on the strong low rankness characteristic of the RSIs, IGLL fully utilizes the background information for foreground inpainting and constrains the consistency of the key ranks. Based on the low smoothness characteristic of the RSIs, learnable edges and structure priors are designed to enhance the non-smoothness of the results. Specifically, the generator of IGLL consists of a pixel-level reconstruction net (PIRN) and a perception-level reconstruction net (PERN). In PIRN, the proposed global attention module (GAM) establishes long-range pixel dependencies. GAM performs precise normalization and avoids overfitting. In PERN, the proposed flexible feature similarity module (FFSM) computes the similarity between background and foreground features and selects a reasonable feature for recovery. Compared with existing works, FFSM improves the fineness of feature matching. To avoid the problem of local-smoothness in the results, both the generator and discriminator utilize the structure priors and learnable edges to regularize large concentrated missing regions. Additionally, IGLL incorporates mathematical constraints into deep-learning models. A singular value decomposition (SVD) loss item is proposed to model the low-rankness characteristic, and it constrains feature consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IGLL performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of the reconstruction quality and computation costs, especially on RSIs with high mask ratios. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal the effectiveness of GAM, FFSM, and SVD loss.

However, with the increase of volume and complexity of mobility data, it has become challenging to retrieve important information and critical features of spatiotemporal mobility.

This paper introduces a data-driven approach for estimating high-dimensional travel demands. We propose a method to identify mobility patterns using a probabilistic tensor decomposition approach for interpreting the complexity and uncertainty of mobility data. Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is applied for inferring mobility patterns. A case study is presented, where the proposed model is applied to New York city taxi data.

We examine each method's accuracy, stability, and consistency through a series of test cases. These methods are applied to simulate some selected mathematical models, and the results are shown in tables. The graph of each table is depicted in figures for discussion and comparative analysis. The results show that, while straightforward, the Euler method demonstrates significant limitations in accuracy compared to the Classical Runge-Kutta method, which provides reliable and precise results. The Adomian Decomposition Method solves the problems and yields results very close to the analytical solution, but the block method performs better due to its multistep approach. Simulink offers a more robust approach for modelling and simulation with visible and interpretable solutions for good understanding.

This framework has been applied to analyze diverse datasets related to a wide range of problems: from COVID-19 to wildfires and climate. Here, we will focus on the analysis of geothermal prospectivity of the Great Basin, U.S. The basin covers a vast area that is yet to be thoroughly explored to discover new geothermal resources. The available regional geochemical data are expected to provide critical information about the geothermal reservoir properties in the basin, including temperature, fluid/heat flow, boundary conditions, and spatial extent. The geochemical data may also include hidden (latent) information that is a proxy for geothermal prospectivity. We processed the sparse geochemical dataset of 18 geochemical attributes observed at 14,341 locations.

Mizin,2023,"Over the past decades orientalism as an approach adopted in Western studies of nonWestern cultures has been subject to major philosophical analysis. The critical impulse that was transmitted by Edward Said to the scientific community in 1978 was powerful enough to create a universal framework. This conceptual framework makes possible both a revisionist point of view toward the West and a Western offensive discourse toward the so-called internal colonization. When we decompose Orientalism into components, for example through hermeneutic analysis, this phenomenon turns out to be one of the justifiably commonplace problems of the representation of nonWestern cultures in Western academic studies. Orientalists and researchers of non-Western cultures are criticized for mechanistic constructivism applied to the Other, but at the same time, conservative ideologists (René Guénon, Oswald Spengler, etc.) tend to draw attention to the fundamental crisis of Western science, its epistemological dysfunction and unnecessitated plurality that does not bring us closer to understanding the essence. However, both approaches unfairly overlook the factor of already exerted constructive influence on non-Western cultures. Orientalism can be seen not only as a form of exploitation, but also as a form of providing a language of self-interpretation, which have had a visible effect on non-Western cultures' understanding of themselves.

However, when the response variables are available, PCA does not guarantee that the derived principal components are informative to the response variables. Supervised PCA (SPCA) methods address this limitation by incorporating response variables into the learning process, typically through an objective function similar to PCA. Existing SPCA methods do not adequately address the challenge of deriving projections that are both interpretable and informative with respect to the response variable. The only existing approach attempting to overcome this, relies on a mathematically complicated manifold optimization scheme, sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. We propose covariance-supervised principal component analysis (CSPCA), a novel SPCA method that projects data into a lower-dimensional space by balancing (1) covariance between projections and responses and (2) explained variance, controlled via a regularization parameter. The projection matrix is derived through a closed-form solution in the form of a simple eigenvalue decomposition. To enhance computational efficiency for high-dimensional datasets, we extend CSPCA using the standard Nystr\""om method.

 Standard-of-care treatment regimens have long been designed for maximal cell kill, yet these strategies often fail when applied to metastatic cancers due to the emergence of drug resistance. Adaptive treatment strategies have been developed as an alternative approach, dynamically adjusting treatment to suppress the growth of treatment-resistant populations, delaying, or even preventing, tumor progression. Promising clinical results in prostate cancer indicate the potential to optimize adaptive treatment protocols. We propose the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to guide adaptive drug scheduling, and demonstrate that these treatment schedules can outperform the current adaptive protocols in a mathematical model calibrated to prostate cancer dynamics, more than doubling the time to progression. We show that the DRL strategies are robust to patient variability, including both tumor dynamics and clinical monitoring schedules. We demonstrate that the DRL framework can produce interpretable, adaptive strategies based on a single tumor burden threshold, replicating and informing optimal treatment strategies. Given the DRL framework has no knowledge of the underlying mathematical tumor model, this demonstrates the capability of DRL to help develop treatment strategies in novel or complex settings. Finally, we propose a five-step pathway combining mechanistic modeling with the DRL framework to translate this approach to the clinic with limited information for a given patient. Integrating conventional tools to ensure the interpretability of traditionally `black-box' DRL models, we generate personalized treatment schedules that consistently outperform clinical standard-of-care protocols.

The ratios of the geometric parameters of the shell differ significantly from thin-walled structures, to which traditional technical hypotheses could be applied. The formulation of a mathematical model defining the stress-strain states of a thick-walled structure was carried out within the framework of a nonlinear three-dimensional theory. The peculiarity of the developed model was that orthotropic composites were adopted as the structural materials of the shell, the deformation and strength properties of which manifest themselves in different ways in accordance with the types of stress states being realized. The manifestation of such mechanical properties of materials is interpreted as induced heterogeneity, which significantly complicates the methodology for calculating spatial structures. Due to the specified features of the research object, isoparametric finite elements of a three-dimensional tetrahedral shape, the nodes of which had three degrees of freedom, were used to develop a computational model. In order to adequately account for the stiffness properties of orthotropic composites exhibiting induced heterogeneity, the basis of the determining relationships for them was the deformation potential formulated in the normalized stress tensor space associated with the main axes of orthotropy of materials. Due to the nonlinearity of the problem under consideration, the process of solving it was based on the method of variable elasticity parameters. As a result of the implementation of the computational model, comprehensive information was obtained on the stresses, deformations and displacements of the shell, the main of which are presented in the text of the article with the addition of their analysis.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b56ec919cffff882c3d2f752e560783fc8c75557,https://doi.org/10.22337/2587-9618-2024-20-4-141-149,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b56ec919cffff882c3d2f752e560783fc8c75557,International Journal for Computational Civil and Structural Engineering,"Engineering, Materials Science",0,da702b18a467a3e0b6ed4c1470e9af52,10.22337/2587-9618-2024-20-4-141-149,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Materials Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:26.107098+00:00

The diversity of cell states and the transitions between them have been interpreted as bifurcations in these dynamics. However, due to the complexity of networks and limited knowledge of reaction kinetics, bifurcation behaviors in biological systems remain largely underexplored. To address this, we developed a mathematical method, Structural Bifurcation Analysis (SBA), which decomposes the system into substructures and determines important aspects of bifurcation behaviors—such as substructures responsible for bifurcation conditions, bifurcation-inducing parameters, and bifurcating variables—solely from network topology. We establish a direct relationship between SBA and classical bifurcation analysis, enabling the study of systems even in the presence of conserved quantities. Additionally, we provide a step-by-step bifurcation analysis for general use. We applied our method to the macrophage M1/M2 polarization system.

Despite this, few formal approaches have been proposed to determine how the various preclinical models represent/resemble primary patient tumors. Here, we present the first comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq analysis of neuroblastoma across an extensive cohort of patient tumors and a variety of preclinical model systems (n = 126 total samples assembled – the largest cohort of its kind). By developing an unsupervised machine learning method, which we term “automatic consensus nonnegative matrix factorization” (acNMF), we have integrated and contrasted the transcriptional landscapes of patient tumors with those of cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and genetic mouse models (GEMM). We discovered that the dominant adrenergic gene expression programs commonly found in neuroblastoma patient tumors were generally preserved across all preclinical models. However, the presumptive chemo-resistant mesenchymal-like programs, while identifiable in cell lines, were primarily restricted to subpopulations of cancer-associated fibroblasts and Schwann-like cells in vivo. Surprisingly however, a mesenchymal-like program could be acutely chemotherapy-induced in GEMM and was evident in pre-treated patient and PDX samples, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of therapy escape resulting from an acute shift in cell state. In addition, our approach could further delineate the classical neuroblastoma adrenergic and mesenchymal gene expression programs, discovering for example, novel subpopulations of cancer associated fibroblasts and reproducible subtypes of adrenergic programs. These behaviors were conserved across tumors and preclinical models, which we validated by RNA in situ hybridization, an ultra-sensitive, high resolution, spatial transcriptomics technology. Overall, we offer a nuanced, high-resolution view of neuroblastoma pre-clinical systems for advancing therapeutic development, as well as a generalizable set of computational tools, which can be applied in other diseases. We have created an open-source web resource, featuring this integrated map to aid the scientific community in further exploration of these integrated data (available at http://pscb.stjude.org).

S. Novikov",2025,"Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in computationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields due to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through mathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions within a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted potential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed approach achieves up to 50% compression without any loss of MTP accuracy and can be applied to compress other MLIPs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3555b33df02d12667fab93a1f742b60aa6225a3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04440.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3555b33df02d12667fab93a1f742b60aa6225a3,,"Physics, Materials Science, Computer Science",0,821927b962ac40ccf71d10ffde1002bd,,2509.04440,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Materials Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

The instruction of physical and mathematical disciplines in higher education institutions employing cutting-edge methods and universal approaches, which seamlessly integrate scientific and engineering activities of future specialists, remains one of the pertinent and priority tasks. The utilization of multidimensional or even infinite-dimensional spaces has become an effective and nearly indispensable tool in mathematical modeling of physical phenomena. This circumstance is directly linked to the increasing level of abstraction and the refinement of mathematical methods. The use of geometric methods inherent in vector algebra and vector analysis as the foundation for studying mechanics, despite their illustrative nature, is losing its relevance. Methods built upon matrix formalism are evolving as substitutes. The matrix framework enables the exploitation of phase space advantages to derive canonical equations of motion for continuous media and electromagnetic field equations in covariant forms. The electromagnetic potential acquires mechanical significance, allowing the utilization of electromechanical analogies at a fundamental level rather than on a merely formal basis, as done in classical electrodynamics. Goal. The aim is to broaden the domain of matrix formalism application to infinite-dimensional spaces, substantiate its advantages compared to other approaches used in teaching the fundamentals of electrodynamics, and demonstrate its potential both in terms of modeling and utilizing computer technologies. Methodology. The methodological foundation for choosing matrix methods lies in the utilization of statistical modeling techniques for the motion of electromechanical systems in infinite-dimensional spaces. Additionally, electrical phenomena are viewed as manifestations of mechanical motion in spacetime. Such an approach enables the extensive use of analogical reasoning to interpret and understand equations that possess the most abstract nature. Results.  It has been demonstrated that the matrix method, previously applied in teaching classical mechanics, allows leveraging the benefits of transitioning to configuration space and phase space for obtaining canonical equations of relativistic mechanics and electromagnetic field equations. Moreover, the electromagnetic field is regarded as an integral part of relativistic dynamics. Originality. To enhance the understanding of electrodynamical processes, the mechanical nature of electrical phenomena is explored in this study, employing formal-mathematical analogies with classical mechanics. An inherent feature of the approach is the utilization of infinite-dimensional matrices with real coefficients, which, however, does not lead to significant complications. Practical value. The proposed method effectively formalizes the equations of electrodynamics, facilitating their utilization in solving practical problems with the aid of computer technologies, while remaining within the confines of standard mathematical preparation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32b32f7ec3315933bcf4f1589b4bb61698c197aa,http://bulletin.khadi.kharkov.ua/article/download/301397/293538,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32b32f7ec3315933bcf4f1589b4bb61698c197aa,Bulletin of Kharkov National Automobile and Highway University,"Engineering, Education, Physics",0,2116370a05e7005dd3d9abb475b2ea51,10.30977/bul.2219-5548.2024.104.1.146,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Education'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

Cai, Chengsheng Mao, Yuan Luo",2021,"Background: The increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHR) across the US has created troves of computable data, to which machine learning methods have been applied to extract useful insights. In particular, tensor factorization is one such method which has seen much development in recent years. EHR data, represented as a three-dimensional analogue of a matrix (tensor), is decomposed into two-dimensional factors that can be interpreted as computational phenotypes. Constraints imposed during the factorization can promote the discovery of phenotypes with certain desirable properties. Methods: We apply constrained tensor factorization to derive computational phenotypes and predict mortality in cohorts of patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer in the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse from 2000 to 2015. In our experiments, we examined using a supervised term in the factorization algorithm, filtering tensor co-occurrences by medical indication, and incorporating additional social determinants of health (SDOH) covariates in the factorization process. We evaluated the resulting computational phenotypes qualitatively and by assessing their ability to predict five-year mortality using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic. Results: Filtering by medical indication led to more concise and interpretable phenotypes. Mortality prediction performance (AUC) varied under the different experimental conditions and by cancer type (breast: 0.623 – 0.694, prostate: 0.603 – 0.750, colorectal: 0.523 – 0.641, and lung: 0.517 – 0.623). Generally, prediction performance improved with the use of a supervised term and the incorporation of SDOH covariates. Conclusion: Constrained tensor factorization, applied to sparse EHR data of patients with cancer, can discover computational phenotypes predictive of five-year mortality. The incorporation of SDOH variables into the factorization algorithm is an easy-to-implement and effective way to improve prediction performance.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32123f6c22777c7680d603873773155302856b92,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12933.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32123f6c22777c7680d603873773155302856b92,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Medicine, Computer Science",0,56083dfd9ee7cbc0c99105a7bfc211cf,,2112.12933,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

The theoretical foundation of this framework is the main algebraic result of this paper (Theorem A): a proof that the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, A_Jac, possesses the structure of a homotopy E3-algebra. This algebraic structure is shown to be a consequence of 3-dimensional geometry, originating from a""Tetrahedron Principle""where the fundamental IHX relation is interpreted as an algebraic manifestation of the tetrahedron's combinatorial properties. This geometric perspective is used to provide a rigorous proof of the""Principle of Decomposability""that underpins the Goussarov-Habiro clasper calculus, thereby supplying a mathematical justification for the consistency of this geometric surgery theory. To establish a computational basis, the framework is built from the first principles of factorization homology, from which a universal surgery formula is derived via the excision axiom (Theorem B) independently of any conjectural models. The utility of this axiomatically-grounded theory is demonstrated by constructing a new observable, the""H_1-decorated LMO invariant.""This invariant is defined in accordance with the principles of TQFT, where the evaluation of a closed diagram (a numerical invariant) is the trace of the corresponding open diagram (an operator). As the main applied result of this paper (Theorem C), it is proven that this invariant distinguishes the lens spaces L(156, 5) and L(156, 29), a pair known to be indistinguishable by the classical LMO invariant. This result validates the proposed framework and establishes the LMO Spectrum as a new tool in quantum topology that unifies the geometric intuition of clasper theory with the algebraic rigor of modern homotopy theory.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/802482612354bf90ad067ae567bf8c611f10e37a,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18985.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/802482612354bf90ad067ae567bf8c611f10e37a,,"Mathematics, Physics, Mathematics",0,2d0006a3500a0806b626f5916e40af55,,2508.18985,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

This study presents a comparative evaluation of topic modeling techniques applied to Nepali political news, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and BERTopic, a Transformer-based neural topic modeling approach. A largescale dataset of Nepali political news articles from 2018 to 2023 was collected and preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Experimental results indicate that LDA outperforms neural topic modeling approaches in the Nepali language context due to the limitations of pre-trained Transformer models for Nepali. Coherence score evaluations confirm LDA's superior topic consistency and interpretability compared to alternative methods. The study identifies key political themes and their temporal trends, offering insights into the evolution of political discourse in Nepal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study evaluating multiple topic modeling techniques for Nepali text analysis.

This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users'actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM.

The methods based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for community detection have been widely studied and applied because of their flexibility and high interpretability. Nevertheless, accompanied by ideal assumptions, classic community detection methods face the following problems. First, they lead to a mismatch between communities, i.e., topology and semantic information. Second, they cannot overcome the effect of macroscopic semantic noise on methods. Finally, they cannot retain the nodes’ distance information in the high-dimensional topology space. Aiming at the these problems, this article proposes a community detection method with self-perception ability that solves the problem of macro semantic noise. The aforementioned issues are overcome by introducing the subspace transfer module and the generalized Laplacian self-perception module.

Wyłomańska",2023,"Time-frequency representation (TFR) is often used for non-stationary signal analysis. The most intuitive and interpretable TFR is the spectrogram. Recently, a concept of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully applied to local damage detection in rolling elements of bearings via spectrogram factorization. NMF applied to the spectrogram allows one to find an informative frequency band, which could be further used as a filter characteristic. However, the obtained filter characteristics mostly detect the informative frequency band, which also encompasses a lot of noise. In the case where noise is more problematic, as is the case for acoustic signals from industrial machines, the NMF hardly detects the damage. To solve this problem and obtain more selective filters, which are more robust to noise, we propose the non-negative matrix under-approximation (NMU) as an informative frequency band selector. Due to the more sparse parts-based representation of the NMU compared to NMF, NMU provides more selective filter characteristics, which neglect the non-informative frequency bands related to the noise. In practice, it means that NMU gives a better signal-to-noise ratio for the filtered signal.

Therefore, we present omicsGMF, a fast, scalable, and interpretable matrix factorization method, tailored for bulk and single-cell proteomics data. Unlike current workflows that sequentially apply imputation, batch correction, and principal component analysis, omicsGMF integrates these steps into a unified framework, dramatically enhancing data processing and dimensionality reduction.

f48bd5ff22c6b9997180a53d66356de4bceafaf4,Dyadic Factorization and Efficient Inversion of Sparse Positive Definite Matrices,"Michal Kos, Krzysztof Podg'orski, Hanqing Wu",2025,"In inverting large sparse matrices, the key difficulty lies in effectively exploiting sparsity during the inversion process. One well-established strategy is the nested dissection, which seeks the so-called sparse Cholesky factorization. We argue that the matrices for which such factors can be found are characterized by a hidden dyadic sparsity structure. This paper builds on that idea by proposing an efficient approach for inverting such matrices. The method consists of two independent steps: the first packs the matrix into a dyadic form, while the second performs a sparse (dyadic) Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the packed matrix. The novel packing procedure works by recovering block-tridiagonal structures, focusing on aggregating terms near the diagonal using the $l_1$-norm, which contrasts with traditional methods that prioritize minimizing bandwidth, i.e. the $l_\infty$-norm. The algorithm performs particularly well for matrices that can be packed into banded or dyadic forms which are moderately dense. Due to the properties of $l_1$-norm, the packing step can be applied iteratively to reconstruct the hidden dyadic structure, which corresponds to the detection of separators in the nested dissection method. We explore the algebraic properties of dyadic-structured matrices and present an algebraic framework that allows for a unified mathematical treatment of both sparse factorization and efficient inversion of factors. For matrices with a dyadic structure, we introduce an optimal inversion algorithm and evaluate its computational complexity. The proposed inversion algorithm and core algebraic operations for dyadic matrices are implemented in the R package DyadiCarma, utilizing Rcpp and RcppArmadillo for high-performance computing.

Gabrielson, Vince D. Calhoun, T. Adalı",2025,"Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a powerful data-driven method that has been widely applied in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis to uncover underlying sources. An attractive way to boost ICA performance is via constraints to guide ICA factors to be similar to user-supplied ""references"", allowing incorporation of prior-knowledge into the factorization. However, most of existing constrained ICA methods typically only impose source constraints and are unable to impose constraints on the mixing matrix. With multi-subject medical imaging datasets, constraining the mixing matrix with subjects’ symptom-related measurements, such as clinical scores or cognitive variables, enhances the algorithm’s ability to identify brain activities associated with these symptoms. This offers a novel perspective for understanding the pathologies underlying various psychiatric disorders. Therefore, to overcome the limitations of existing constrained ICA algorithms, we introduce a new constrained ICA algorithm: adaptive-reverse constrained matrix entropy bound minimization (arc-M-EBM), which imposes constraints on the mixing matrix and uses adaptive-reverse thresholding to avoid overfitting or underfitting. This approach ensures flexibility and leads to more accurate and interpretable source separation. Simulations demonstrate that arc-M-EBM outperforms traditional ICA methods. Application to resting-state fMRI data from 176 subjects from healthy controls and patients reveals significant relationships between constrained components and clinical measures, enhancing our understanding of brain-behavior relationships.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25111a52187e617454d48b0fd06af717dd3dbcd9,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25111a52187e617454d48b0fd06af717dd3dbcd9,Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Medicine",0,6299687572add37a31c83c3750110856,10.1109/CISS64860.2025.10944691,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

Tongue coating differences are key diagnostic markers, yet molecular-level analyses are lacking. We applied metabolomics to identify differential metabolites distinguishing these patterns. Methods In this study, the first principal component was analyzed by the OPLS-DA model. The model quality was evaluated by 7-fold cross-validation, and the model validity was evaluated based on R²Y (interpretability of categorical variable Y) and Q² (predictability of the model), and the permutation test was used for further verification. Strict criteria were used for differential metabolite screening. The Euclidean distance matrix of the quantitative values of differential metabolites was calculated, and cluster analysis was performed using the complete linkage method. All pathways mapped by human differential metabolites were retrieved through the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway database, and key pathways were screened out by combining enrichment and topological analysis. The spearman algorithm was used to calculate the correlation coefficient and P value matrix. Finally, the effect of the binary classifier was evaluated by drawing the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) and calculating the area under the curve (AUC), and the combination with the highest AUC was selected as the optimal diagnostic model. Results Twenty significant differential metabolites emerged (P<0.05). Pathway analysis highlighted three key pathways, notably glycerophospholipid metabolism involving phosphatidylethanolamine. Phenol-based models showed optimal diagnostic performance (highest AUC). Conclusion Metabolite profiles significantly differed between CD and DH. Glycerophospholipid metabolism was central, with phosphatidylethanolamine as a key metabolite. Phenol requires further validation as a diagnostic biomarker.

Here we address this gap by applying a network-based, integrative framework that combines whole-blood transcriptomic data with gene-trait associations to uncover mechanistic insights into DS-associated conditions. First, we performed matrix factorization using PLIER on Human Trisome Project (HTP) RNA-Seq profiles from 304 trisomy-21 (T21) and 95 euploid (D21) individuals, deriving 156 biologically interpretable gene modules. We then identified 92 modules whose activity differed significantly between T21 and D21 and annotated these with prior-knowledge and KEGG pathways. To connect modules to clinical traits, we integrated PrediXcan-derived TWAS results from the UK Biobank, revealing 25 T21-specific modules with significant gene-trait associations (FDR < 0.1), including modules linked to cardiovascular, hematological, immune, metabolic, and neurological phenotypes relevant to DS. Using HTP clinical records as a replication cohort, 13 of these modules reliably predicted comorbidity status (AUC > 0.65, mAPS > 0.65). Most notably module 37, an interferon-stimulated gene network, whose elevated expression robustly distinguished DS individuals with pulmonary hypertension (AUC = 0.76, mAPS = 0.73).

 High-risk neuroblastoma is one of the most difficult to treat pediatric cancers, with a survival rate of only about 50% and significant long-term consequences from current chemotherapy. Preclinical models such as cell lines and mice are the backbone of drug development and experimental-mechanistic oncology, but the development of new treatments is hampered in part by a lack of understanding of the direct clinical relevance of such data collected in preclinical models. Despite this, few formal methods have been developed to determine how these various models represent/resemble primary patient tumors. Here, we present the first comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq analysis of neuroblastoma across an extensive cohort of patient tumors and a variety of preclinical model systems (n = 126 total samples assembled - the largest cohort of its kind). By building an innovative unsupervised machine learning method, which we term “automatic consensus nonnegative matrix factorization” (acNMF), we have integrated and contrasted the transcriptional landscapes of patient tumors with those of cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and genetic mouse models (GEMM).Using these tools, we discovered the dominant adrenergic gene expression programs found in neuroblastoma patient tumors were preserved across all preclinical models. However, the presumptive chemo-resistant mesenchymal-like programs, while identifiable in cell lines, were primarily restricted to subpopulations of cancer-associated fibroblasts and Schwann-like cells in vivo. Surprisingly, a mesenchymal-like program could be acutely chemotherapy-induced in GEMM and was evident in pre-treated patient and PDX samples, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of therapy escape. In addition to these core findings, our computational tools were able to further delineate the classical neuroblastoma adrenergic and mesenchymal gene expression programs, discovering for example, novel subpopulations of cancer associated fibroblasts. These behaviors were conserved across tumors and most preclinical models, which we validated by RNA in situ hybridization, which is a high resolution ultra sensitive spatial transcriptomics technology. Our work cautions against overreliance on traditional preclinical models without recognizing their limitations and we offer a nuanced, high-resolution view of neuroblastoma pre-clinical systems for advancing therapeutic development. We have launched an open-source web resource, featuring this integrated map to aid the scientific community in further exploration of these data and hypothesis generation (available at http://pscb.stjude.org).

Najarian, R. Stidham",2025,"Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify different types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix and tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with multi-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial for understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported symptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than other data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping and other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of computational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which integrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict medication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based method that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the UC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework that makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us to handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts changes in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and 0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes consisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal patterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be successfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We identify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes include several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant infromation that is usually discarded.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10506b9250a48eb0c14c8b8034467ad169b05dfd,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20065.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10506b9250a48eb0c14c8b8034467ad169b05dfd,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Medicine, Computer Science",0,9cbea3a7611944f2b7b25477b3962be7,10.48550/arXiv.2506.20065,2506.20065,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

This theory utilizes Bresler-Marcuvitz transverse equations, characteristic Green’s function procedure, and the Wiener-Hopf technique to address complex scattering problems [1]. The effectiveness of this technique has already been demonstrated in the analysis of wedge problems in isotropic media [2], and now we have extended its application to more general cases [3–4]. We derive Generalized Wiener-Hopf equations (GWHEs) from spectral functional equations in angular regions filled with arbitrary linear media with the application of boundary conditions as solution of transverse equations. These equations can be systematically interpreted with network formalism. We recall that GWHEs have plus and minus unknowns that are defined into different complex planes but related together. We believe that this mathematical technique significantly expands the possibilities for spectral analysis of electromagnetic problems involving angular regions filled with complex arbitrary linear media. We observe that the GWHEs in arbitrary linear media usually report physical unknowns defined into multiple complex planes (more than 2) as the physical problem usually contains more than one propagation constant. Traditional spectral methods such as SommerfeldMalyuzhinets (SM) method, the Kontorovich-Lebedev (KL) transform method, and the Wiener-Hopf (WH) method are fundamental and complementary in studying diffraction problems in presence of sharp discontinuities immersed in isotropic region. The primary benefit in utilizing the SM and KL techniques is the application of the spectral complex angular plane derived from the Sommerfeld integral theory, which has also been successfully applied in the Wiener-Hopf framework through the concept of rotating waves in isotropic angular region, see for instance [2] and references therein. However, the definition of this complex plane is possible in problem with one propagation constant. One of the most important result obtained in presence of anisotropic media is the exact solution obtained by Felsen in the case of the scattering by a PEC wedge immersed in uniaxial medium illuminated by plane waves at normal incidence [5], by applying a generalized version of separation of variables. In the present work, we apply for the first times direct Fredholm factorization [6] to GWHEs avoiding introduction of spectral mapping to resort to CWHEs. In particular the method is effective for problems with more than one propagation constat where the spectral mapping cannot be introduced, and other techniques are ineffective. The fundamental tool in direct Fredholm factorization is the application of Cauchy integral representation to GWHEs that allows to represent unknowns in one complex plane starting from multiple complex planes.

Sapper, Sean Youn, D. Henze, M. Canagaratna, Harald Stark, J. Jimenez",2025,"Abstract. Weighted positive matrix factorization (PMF) has been used by scientists to find small sets of underlying factors in environmental data. However, as the size of the data has grown, increasing computational costs have made it impractical to use traditional methods for this factorization. In this paper, we present a new external weighting method to dramatically decrease computational costs for these traditional algorithms. The external weighting scheme, along with the randomized hierarchical alternating least squares (RHALS) algorithm, was applied to the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS 2013) dataset of gaseous highly oxidized multifunctional molecules (HOMs). The modified RHALS algorithm successfully reproduced six previously identified interpretable factors, with the total computation time of the nonoptimized code showing potential improvements of the order of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to competing algorithms. We also investigate rotational ambiguity in the solution and present a simple “pulling” method to rotate a set of factors. This method is shown to find alternative solutions and, in some cases, lower the weighted residual error of the algorithm.

Recent theory explains implicit regularization over the deep matrix factorization (DMF) model and analyzes the trajectory of discrete gradient dynamics in the optimization process. These discrete gradient dynamics can mathematically characterize the practical learning rate of adaptive gradient (AdaGrad) optimization, such as root-mean-square propagation (RMSProp). Discrete gradient dynamics analysis has been successfully applied to shallow networks but encounters difficulty in complex computation for deep networks. In this work, we introduce another discrete gradient dynamics, landscape analysis, to theoretically and experimentally explain the implicit regularization of RMSProp-based deep networks. It mainly focuses on gradient regions like saddle points and local minima. We investigate the benefits of increasing learning rates in saddle point escaping (SPE) stages. We prove that, for a rank-R matrix reconstruction, DMF will converge to a second-order critical point after R stages of SPE. Besides, we analyze the time it takes to escape from the plateau of the SPE stage. These conclusions are further experimentally verified on low-rank matrix, image reconstruction, and Hankel matrix reconstruction problems. Our proof is also applicable to gradient descent (GD) and adaptive moment estimation (Adam) but cannot apply to AdaGrad, further showing experimentally that the implicit regularization capability of RMSProp is stronger than GD and AdaGrad and weaker than Adam.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1f93212f37cf260d3895587a1335c73272bb994,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1f93212f37cf260d3895587a1335c73272bb994,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,"Medicine, Computer Science, Mathematics",0,cdc89badd309989e40e8372428a2a895,10.1109/TNNLS.2025.3574683,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

Existing topic models primarily integrate word embedding and matrix decomposition, which only generates keyword-based hot topics with weak interpretability, making it difficult to meet the specific needs of users. Mining phrase-based hot topics with syntactic dependency structure have been proven to model structure information effectively. A key challenge lies in the effective integration of the above information into the hot topic mining process.Design/methodology/approachThis paper proposes the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based hot topic mining method, semantics syntax-assisted hot topic model (SSAHM), which combines semantic association and syntactic dependency structure. First, a semantic–syntactic component association matrix is constructed. Then, the matrix is used as a constraint condition to be incorporated into the block coordinate descent (BCD)-based matrix decomposition process. Finally, a hot topic information-driven phrase extraction algorithm is applied to describe hot topics.FindingsThe efficacy of the developed model is demonstrated on two real-world datasets, and the effects of dependency structure information on different topics are compared. The qualitative examples further explain the application of the method in real scenarios.Originality/valueMost prior research focuses on keyword-based hot topics. Thus, the literature is advanced by mining phrase-based hot topics with syntactic dependency structure, which can effectively analyze the semantics. The development of syntactic dependency structure considering the combination of word order and part-of-speech (POS) is a step forward as word order, and POS are only separately utilized in the prior literature. Ignoring this synergy may miss important information, such as grammatical structure coherence and logical relations between syntactic components.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55354fd67066270908f4854ca2f3b1d2b5ba6a35,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JEBDE-07-2022-0023/full/pdf?title=user-concerned-actionable-hot-topic-mining-enhancing-interpretability-via-semantic-syntactic-association-matrix-factorization,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55354fd67066270908f4854ca2f3b1d2b5ba6a35,Journal of Electronic Business &amp; Digital Economics,Computer Science,0,097676d4cd5cedc1a5e8dfc676445ed7,10.1108/jebde-07-2022-0023,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here, we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering, while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features, exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together, these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fd580f711583f88df30a67e8501d9e766af17007,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10920.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fd580f711583f88df30a67e8501d9e766af17007,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science",0,db5e5d97e90e13a5f9fdbc22a424ff32,10.48550/arXiv.2506.10920,2506.10920,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:12.191642+00:00

The noise present in the seismic data is categorized into two types: random and erratic noise. The random noise is distributed uniformly over the seismic data. The erratic noise attenuation is always challenging due to the unknown distribution of high-amplitude peaks over seismic data. The existing double sparsity dictionary learning (DSDL) method performs with analytical and adaptive transforms; both the transforms include iterative algorithms with K-singular-value decomposition (SVD); it is computationally costly, and the dictionary is initialized with trained data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method of dictionary learning with double regularization (DLDR) to denoise both random and erratic noise from seismic data. In double regularization, we used with $\ell _{1}$ -norm and nuclear norm. The denoised data is applied to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) to improve denoising while preserving the signal features from seismic data while reducing the computational cost. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean squared error (MSE), and local similarity map. The numerical results demonstrated that the proposed method resulted in higher SNR, lower MSE, and less signal leakage from seismic data.

Vasilakos",2025,"Device-free localization (DFL) represents an emerging technology in autonomous driving assistance systems, sensing targets around a vehicle without requiring them carrying any devices. Current machine learning methodologies for DFL struggle with adaptively extracting discriminative features, resulting in weak robustness. Although dictionary learning techniques have shown potentiality in robust feature extraction for images and signals, their direct application to improving the robustness of DFL presents significant challenges. Specifically, the unsupervised mechanism of dictionary learning complicates the calibration of target location bases. The complex optimization processes also lead to inefficient parameter updating. To address these issues, we propose a deep-supervised dictionary learning (DSDL) approach for enhancing the robustness of DFL. The proposed DSDL method synergizes the advantages of sparse representation and deep learning, incorporating the robustness and interpretability of dictionary learning with the efficient parameter updating characteristic of deep learning. The supervised mechanism enables collaborative labeling of the learned signal bases. Experimental results, derived from an established DFL system, demonstrate that our DSDL outperforms existing techniques in both robustness and accuracy. DSDL maintains strong robustness and achieves high localization accuracy, surpassing 99% on clean data and sustaining over 97% accuracy under 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

However, most existing CDL methods are based on batch processing, which requires computing the entire dataset at once, resulting in a significant memory requirement that limits further development. To address this issue, researchers have turned to online convolutional dictionary learning (OCDL) in recent years. OCDL inputs data as a stream and stores all historical information in a pair of fixed-size history arrays. This approach avoids the problem of increasing memory requirements with the number of samples. However, current OCDL methods encounter two primary issues when handling big datasets or large dictionaries: the high time complexity of updating history arrays or dictionaries and the challenge of selecting hyperparameters linked to the ADMM algorithm. This paper proposes a slice-based approximate OCDL method called SAOCDL to address the aforementioned problems. The algorithm utilizes a sparse approximation model, where historical data samples are approximated as the convolution sum of the best local dictionary of a single sample and the corresponding local sparse codes. The current sample and a pair of fixed-size history arrays that store this approximation are used to update the best local dictionary. The resulting optimization problem is solved in the spatial domain using the proposed convergent inertial proximal-gradient algorithm, which combines dry friction with Hessian-driven damping. Extensive experiments were conducted on various benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SAOCDL approach is highly competitive in terms of performance, efficiency, and memory with state-of-the-art OCDL and CDL algorithms.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ff7a5aec83dc63f029b3ae92670f390efd9b241,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ff7a5aec83dc63f029b3ae92670f390efd9b241,Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Methodologies for Multimedia,Computer Science,0,9409fe4aa8032f0781a7f9a6f6b6e628,10.1145/3689089.3689705,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

The erratic noise attenuation is always challenging due to the unknown distribution of high-amplitude peaks over seismic data. In literature, the double sparsity dictionary learning (DSDL) methods were used for erratic and random noise attenuation. Here, analytical and adaptive transformations are performed sequentially to attenuate erratic and random noises. However, the DSDL technique leads to a high computational cost due to K-SVD. Therefore, we propose a double dictionary learning (DDL) method to denoise both random and erratic noise by preserving the signal features from seismic data. The method uses two parallel adaptive dictionaries for simultaneous denoising, and both dictionaries are concatenated further to form a comprehensive dictionary. The regularized K-SVD was used to update the dictionary and sparse coefficients for signal preservation. The DDL method effectively reduced the computational costs. The DDL method was applied to different synthetic and field datasets for denoising. The numerical results show that the proposed method provides a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lower mean-squared error (mse), and less signal leakage than existing state-of-the-art denoising methods.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c4b6378863f43f880aabd7a150b77d31dde02c8d,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c4b6378863f43f880aabd7a150b77d31dde02c8d,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,"Computer Science, Engineering, Geology, Environmental Science",0,b287dd911e7642f2273e9cf530c08c36,10.1109/LGRS.2025.3580580,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Geology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

 The magnetotelluric (MT) method has been widely applied in deep energy resource surveys with the advantage of large-depth exploration and sensitivity to electrical differences. However, the observed data of the MT method are exceptionally sensitive to artificial noise. To improve the survey effectiveness of the MT method in a strong electromagnetic (EM) interference environment. We introduce the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) into the processing of MT data and propose a recognition and separation method for MT strong noise. First, to obtain a precise signal-to-noise recognition model, we train the TCN network by measuring MT samples that are artificially labeled. Then the trained network is used to separate the signal to be processed into high-quality segments and noise-contaminated segments. Finally, K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) dictionary learning is applied to perform signal-to-noise separation of the recognized noise-contaminated segments to obtain the noise-free signal segments. The noise-free signal segments are recombined with the recognized high-quality signal segments to obtain a complete high-quality signal.

Through learning a basic dictionary for normal pattern and augmenting the low-dimensional sparse dictionaries for analyzing different fault patterns, the process signals can be decomposed into fault-free and fault-related components. To guarantee the in-statistical-control status of the fault-free part and improve detection sensitivity, a $\ell _{2}$-penalty is imposed on the sum of coefficient vectors to ensure that the monitoring statistic related to the fault-free part will not exceed the control limit. In addition, two Frobenius norm penalties are imposed on the zero centered coefficient matrix and atom matrix to improve the robustness of signal decomposition. Instead of imposing $\ell _{1}$-sparsity constraint on the atoms, a hard sparsity constraint is used to correctly select fault-related feature variables, so that fault patterns can be better revealed. The informative dictionaries are then incorporated into the moving window-based monitoring strategy, yielding a fault detection and isolation scheme suitable for incipient faults.

While existing CDL methods are predominantly designed and used for fully supervised settings, many real-world classification tasks often rely on weakly labeled data, where only bag-level annotations are available. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised convolutional dictionary learning framework that jointly learns shared and class-specific components, for multi-instance multi-label (MIML) classification where each example consists of multiple instances and may be associated with multiple labels. Our approach decomposes signals into background patterns captured by a shared dictionary and discriminative features encoded in class-specific dictionaries, with nuclear norm constraints preventing feature dilution. A Block Proximal Gradient method with Majorization (BPG-M) is developed to alternately update dictionary atoms and sparse coefficients, ensuring convergence to local minima. Furthermore, we incorporate a projection mechanism that aggregates instance-level predictions to bag-level labels through learnable pooling operators.Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing MIML methods in terms of classification performance, particularly in low-label regimes. The learned dictionaries provide interpretable representations while effectively handling background noise and variable-length instances, making the method suitable for applications such as environmental sound classification and RF signal analysis.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd5c41d4b2e4544f9d3b29194899f1ee170d6931,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08573.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd5c41d4b2e4544f9d3b29194899f1ee170d6931,,"Engineering, Computer Science",0,98fd3443213f15981150190083286dfe,,2503.08573,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00,2025-09-30 00:46:06.117109+00:00

Numerous techniques have been developed to identify faults in bearings. However, the signals under time-varying speed condition are nonstationary, and most diagnosis methods suffer from the nonstationary property caused by time-varying speed problem. The change of speed changes the fault pulse frequency, but the structure of pulse remains the same. Shift-invariant dictionary learning (SIDL) can learn the repetitive structure in the signal without the limitation of the structure's size. Thus, the fault pulses in the fault signal under time-varying speed condition. Union of circulants dictionary learning (UCDL) is a kind of SIDL, where the algorithm takes the advantage of explicit circulant structures and has the powerful ability to learn the fault pulses into the atoms. In this work, we use UCDL to extract features under time-varying speed condition, and hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to diagnose faults. We further found that UCDL with the global sparse coding named basis pursuit, which can maintain the stability of the coefficient solution, has a better performance in the time-varying diagnosis. To validate the performance of the proposed method named improved SIDL, both simulation and experimental signals are processed, and the diagnosis results prove the high efficiency of the proposed method in the time-varying diagnosis.

From the theoretical analysis, the introduction of deep network to extract the deep-level features of the image and its use in dictionary training is more beneficial to complement the high-frequency information in the low-resolution image. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves the best results in terms of both the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the gradient energy function of the reconstructed images.

Magner, Maxwell McNeil, Petko Bogdanov",2025,"Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand, dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution, called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent. We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality, AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines.

This study presents a multiframe superresolution method using sparse coding to enhance synchrotron radiation microspectroscopy images. By reconstructing high-resolution images from multiple low-resolution ones, exposure time is minimized, reducing radiation effects, thermal drift, and sample degradation while preserving spatial resolution. Unlike deep learning-based superresolution methods, which overlook positional misalignment, our approach treats positional shifts as known control parameters, enhancing superresolution accuracy with a small, noisy dataset. Additionally, our sparse coding method learns an optimal dictionary tailored for nanostructure extraction, fine-tuning the SR process to the unique characteristics of the data, even with noise and limited samples. Applied to 3D nanoscale electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (nano-ESCA) data, our method, utilizing a high-resolution dictionary learned from 3D nano-ESCA datasets, significantly improves image quality, preserving structural details.

Therefore, the LRTC-CSC methods can not only solve the missing value problem but also recover the details.

Despite the numerous applications of deep neural networks in this domain, their lack of interpretability hinders their further adoption. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable network block named DCT-ISTA for the diagnosis of rotating machinery faults, which is obtained by unrolling the classical Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm from the compressive sensing field and integrating prior knowledge from the fault diagnosis domain. DCT-ISTA combines sparse coding with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), formulated as a network through algorithmic unrolling, and integrates it as a data denoising method with backbone networks to enhance their performance.

In this paper, a non-electrical signal feature dataset of key components of high-voltage DC converter valve is established by using principal component analysis to streamline the data volume. The compression-aware feature extraction algorithm based on polynomial matrix sparse coding is used to extract and collect the non-electrical signal parametric data. Through the performance over the experimental signal analysis, it can be known that the eigenvalues of a total of 10 parameters, including the infrared temperature measurement results, the appearance, the presence of corrosion or dirt, and the presence of abnormal vibration and sound, are all greater than 1. Therefore, these 10 parameters are identified as the key parameters. When the number of measurement points is between 64 and 200, the algorithm in this paper can satisfy the need of feature extraction when the signal length is insufficient, compared with the traditional approach.

Sarma, Debasis Samanta",2024,"Graph Signal (GS) representations of multi-variable brain recordings offer a synergistic integration between regional brain activity and global communications inside the human brain. The recent advent of Graph Signal Processing tools provides novel mathematical structures to analyze the brain GSs, thus offering a unique opportunity to trace the information flow inside the brain and identify essential biomarkers. However, brain recording’s intrinsically noisy and high-dimensional nature often leads to the misidentification of critical biomarkers and increased computational requirements. Sparsity-based approaches provide data compression and noise reduction by capturing the most significant information using a limited number of non-zero coefficients from an overcomplete basis dictionary. But their application is limited only to regular data structures. This study proposes a framework for sparse representation of the brain GSs that are defined on the irregular connectivity graph structure. The proposed framework incorporates the connectivity information into the basis dictionary in the form of the normalized Laplacian of the underlying weighted network. Specifically, the proposed parametric dictionary consists of multiple concatenated sub-dictionaries, each being a polynomial of the graph Laplacian matrix. This graph-structure-aware sparse representation framework serves the conflicting requirements of both sparsity and discriminability of the resulting sparse codes. The proposed framework is implemented on open-source Schizophrenic Electroencephalogram data, where a 0.0296 sparse reconstruction RMS error is achieved for only 5 non-zero coefficients. Further, utilizing the sparse codes for normal and Schizophrenic detection using the XGBoost model, 10 -fold cross-validated detection accuracies of $88.43 \%$ and $\mathbf{9 5 . 5 9 \%}$ are achieved for 5 and 8 non-zero coefficients, respectively.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91455bd524a9b1e64a506664f8a78037ab85542f,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/91455bd524a9b1e64a506664f8a78037ab85542f,International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies,"Computer Science, Medicine, Computer Science",0,351197b9744722f5a0ec479c29a174f6,10.1109/ICCCNT61001.2024.10725230,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:59.362493+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:59.362493+00:00

Moreover, the inherent border effect of a convolution model is mitigated with a carefully designed weight function.

 Spike sorting is a crucial step in decoding multichannel extracellular neural signals, enabling the identification of individual neuronal activity.

Latham",2022,"Training data is always finite, making it unclear how to generalise to unseen situations. But, animals do generalise, wielding Occam's razor to select a parsimonious explanation of their observations. How they do this is called their inductive bias, and it is implicitly built into the operation of animals' neural circuits. This relationship between an observed circuit and its inductive bias is a useful explanatory window for neuroscience, allowing design choices to be understood normatively. However, it is generally very difficult to map circuit structure to inductive bias. Here, we present a neural network tool to bridge this gap. The tool meta-learns the inductive bias by learning functions that a neural circuit finds easy to generalise, since easy-to-generalise functions are exactly those the circuit chooses to explain incomplete data.

Generally, we show it can flexibly extract inductive biases from supervised learners, including spiking neural networks, and show how it could be applied to real animals.

Gilbert, C. Panitz, Mingzhou Ding, A. Keil",2025,"ABSTRACT Aversive conditioning changes visuocortical responses to conditioned cues, and the generalization of these changes to perceptually similar cues may provide mechanistic insights into anxiety and fear disorders. Yet, as in many areas of cognitive neuroscience, testing hypotheses about trial‐by‐trial dynamics in conditioning paradigms is challenged by poor single‐trial signal‐to‐noise ratios (SNR), missing trials, and inter‐individual differences. The present technical report demonstrates how a state‐of‐the‐art Bayesian workflow can overcome these issues, using a preliminary sample of simultaneously recorded EEG‐fMRI data. A preliminary group of observers (N = 24) viewed circular gratings varying in orientation, with only one orientation paired with an aversive outcome (noxious electric pulse). Gratings were flickered at 15 Hz to evoke steady‐state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), recorded with 31 channels of EEG in an MRI scanner. First, the benefits of a Bayesian multilevel structure are demonstrated on the fMRI data by improving a standard fMRI first‐level multiple regression. Next, the Bayesian modeling approach is demonstrated by applying a theory‐driven learning model to the EEG data. The multilevel structure of the Bayesian learning model informs and constrains estimates per participant, providing an interpretable generative model. In the example analysis provided in this report, it showed superior cross‐validation accuracy and provided insights into participant‐level learning dynamics. It also isolated the generalization effects of conditioning, providing improved statistical certainty. Lastly, missing trials were interpolated and weighted appropriately using the full model's structure. This is a critical aspect for single‐trial analyses of simultaneously recorded physiological measures because each added measure will typically increase the number of trials missing a complete set of observations. The present report aims to illustrate the utility of this analytical framework. It shows how models may be iteratively built and compared in a modern Bayesian workflow. Future models may use different conceptualizations of learning, allow integration of clinically relevant factors, and enable the fusion of different simultaneous recordings such as EEG, autonomic, behavioral, and hemodynamic data.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7385b4a260e83d2d906aee456a1c206a9e128836,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7385b4a260e83d2d906aee456a1c206a9e128836,Human Brain Mapping,"Medicine, Psychology",0,788c3641d7c4017fc3f2ebe626f00cc7,10.1002/hbm.70360,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Merzon, Sofia Tauriainen, Ana Triana, Tarmo Nurmi, Hanna Huhdanpää, Minna Mannerkoski, Eeva T. Aronen, Mikhail Kantonistov, Linda Henriksson, E. Macaluso, Juha Salmi",2025,"Functional connectomics is a popular approach to investigate the neural underpinnings of developmental disorders of which attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent. Nonetheless, neuronal mechanisms driving the aberrant functional connectivity resulting in ADHD symptoms remain largely unclear. Whereas resting state activity reflecting intrinsic tonic background activity is only vaguely connected to behavioral effects, naturalistic neuroscience has provided means to measure phasic brain dynamics associated with overt manifestation of the symptoms. Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in three experimental conditions, an active virtual reality (VR) task where the participants execute goal-directed behaviors, a passive naturalistic Video Viewing task, and a standard Resting State condition. Thirty-nine children with ADHD and thirty-seven typically developing (TD) children participated in this preregistered study. Functional connectivity was examined with network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical metrics. During the naturalistic VR task, the ADHD group showed weaker task performance and stronger functional connectivity than the TD group. Group differences in functional connectivity were observed in widespread brain networks: particularly subcortical areas showed hyperconnectivity in ADHD. More restricted group differences in functional connectivity were observed during the Video Viewing, and there were no group differences in functional connectivity in the Resting State condition. These observations were consistent across NBS and graph theoretical analyses, although NBS revealed more pronounced group differences. Furthermore, during the VR task and Video Viewing, functional connectivity in TD controls was associated with task performance during the measurement, while Resting State activity in TD controls was correlated with ADHD symptoms rated over six months. We conclude that overt expression of the symptoms is correlated with aberrant brain connectivity in ADHD. Furthermore, naturalistic paradigms where clinical markers can be coupled with simultaneously occurring brain activity may further increase the interpretability of psychiatric neuroimaging findings.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93c7136ebd80a64c98101c8eb60ba320a820a536,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319746,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93c7136ebd80a64c98101c8eb60ba320a820a536,PLoS ONE,"Medicine, Psychology",0,5f2c01968fda6d7c4a201ff3de22ace7,10.1371/journal.pone.0319746,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Here, we approached this problem by modeling gaze patterns of monkeys playing Pac-Man. We first show a transformer network trained to reproduce their gameplay developed internal attention patterns closely matching the monkeys'eye movements. By dissecting the network's attention, we revealed a hierarchical structure comprising two components: a value-based layer encoding fixed object salience, coupled with a dynamic interaction layer tracking relational information between game elements. We further developed a condensed model in which reward-driven attention serves as a gain modulator and is integrated with spatial attention maps, predicting attention as well as the transformer.

Hennel, Christian C. Ruff",2024,"Risk preferences – the willingness to accept greater uncertainty to achieve larger potential rewards – determine many aspects of our lives and are often interpreted as an individual trait that reflects a general ’taste’ for risk. However, this perspective cannot explain why risk preferences can change considerably across contexts and even across repetitions of the identical decisions. Here we provide modelling and neural evidence that contextual shifts and moment-to-moment fluctuations in risk preferences can emerge mechanistically from Bayesian inference on noisy magnitude representations in parietal cortex. Our participants underwent fMRI while choosing between safe and risky options that were either held in working memory or present on the screen. Risky options that were held in working memory were less likely to be chosen (risk aversion) when they had large payoffs but more likely to be chosen (risk-seeking) when they had small payoffs. These counterintuitive effects are mechanistically explained by a computational model of the Bayesian inference underlying the perception of the payoff magnitudes: Options kept in working memory are noisier and therefore more prone to central tendency biases, leading small (or large) payoffs to be overestimated (or underestimated) more. Congruent with the behavioural modelling, fMRI population-receptive field modelling showed that on trials where intraparietal payoff representations were noisier, choices were also less consistent and less risk-neutral, in line with participants resorting more to their prior belief about potential payoffs. Our results highlight that individual risk preferences and their puzzling changes across contexts and choice repetitions are mechanistically rooted in perceptual inference on noisy parietal magnitude representations, with profound implications for economic, psychological, and neuroscience theories of risky behaviour.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0627a0e9f2c2e1b051fa7742045777ca4396824a,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/08/23/2024.08.23.609296.full.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0627a0e9f2c2e1b051fa7742045777ca4396824a,bioRxiv,Biology,0,ba186b16815cf68a9f1f758c3d34d971,10.1101/2024.08.23.609296,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:52.493537+00:00

Cognitive connectomics is undergoing a transformative evolution from static, descriptive brain maps to dynamic, causality-driven models of neural circuitry. Traditional methods captured the architecture of brain networks but often lacked the mechanistic insights necessary to decode real-time brain function. Integrating advances in molecular labeling technologies, high-resolution structural imaging, and computational causal inference offers unprecedented opportunities to map the brain’s operational dynamics with temporal precision. This paper critically synthesizes recent breakthroughs, including molecular barcoding techniques and electron microscopy innovations, and explores the convergence of machine learning-based causal discovery methods. We propose a comprehensive framework that unifies molecular, structural, and computational approaches to establish real-time, mechanistic cognitive connectomics, setting the foundation for next-generation neuroscience research and clinical applications.

Koban",2025,"Human social interactions rely on the ability to reflect on one’s own and others’ internal states and traits—a psychological process known as mentalizing. Impaired or altered self- and other-related mentalizing is a hallmark of multiple psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Yet, replicable and easily testable brain markers of mentalizing have so far been lacking. Here, we apply an interpretable machine learning approach to multiple datasets (total N=281) to train and validate fMRI brain signatures that predict 1) mentalizing about the self, 2) mentalizing about another person, and 3) both types of mentalizing. We test their generalizability across healthy adults, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The classifier trained across both types of mentalizing showed 98% predictive accuracy in independent validation datasets. Self-mentalizing and other-mentalizing classifiers had positive weights in anterior/medial and posterior/lateral brain areas respectively, with accuracy rates of 82% and 77% for out-of-sample prediction. Classifier patterns across cohorts revealed better self/other separation in 1) healthy adults compared to individuals with schizophrenia and 2) with increasing age in adolescence. Together, our findings reveal consistent and separable neural patterns subserving mentalizing about self and others—present at least from the age of adolescence and functionally altered in severe neuropsychiatric disorders. These mentalizing signatures hold promise as mechanistic neuromarkers to measure social-cognitive processes in different contexts and clinical conditions.

While preliminary findings suggest a frequency-dependent behavior in ViT representations, further investigation is needed to generalize across datasets and architectures. This study highlights the potential of frequency-based interpretability but also underscores the need for more rigorous evaluation in larger, more diverse settings.

5855d37f295085befc3229026050eb904450d261,Survey on the Role of Mechanistic Interpretability in Generative AI,Leonardo Ranaldi,2025,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has revolutionised how systems process information, make decisions, and adapt to dynamic environments. AI-driven approaches have significantly enhanced efficiency and problem-solving capabilities across various domains, from automated decision-making to knowledge representation and predictive modelling. These developments have led to the emergence of increasingly sophisticated models capable of learning patterns, reasoning over complex data structures, and generalising across tasks. As AI systems become more deeply integrated into networked infrastructures and the Internet of Things (IoT), their ability to process and interpret data in real-time is essential for optimising intelligent communication networks, distributed decision making, and autonomous IoT systems. However, despite these achievements, the internal mechanisms that drive LLMs’ reasoning and generalisation capabilities remain largely unexplored. This lack of transparency, compounded by challenges such as hallucinations, adversarial perturbations, and misaligned human expectations, raises concerns about their safe and beneficial deployment. Understanding the underlying principles governing AI models is crucial for their integration into intelligent network systems, automated decision-making processes, and secure digital infrastructures. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of explainability approaches aimed at uncovering the fundamental mechanisms of LLMs. We investigate the strategic components contributing to their generalisation abilities, focusing on methods to quantify acquired knowledge and assess its representation within model parameters. Specifically, we examine mechanistic interpretability, probing techniques, and representation engineering as tools to decipher how knowledge is structured, encoded, and retrieved in AI systems. Furthermore, by adopting a mechanistic perspective, we analyse emergent phenomena within training dynamics, particularly memorisation and generalisation, which also play a crucial role in broader AI-driven systems, including adaptive network intelligence, edge computing, and real-time decision-making architectures. Understanding these principles is crucial for bridging the gap between black-box AI models and practical, explainable AI applications, thereby ensuring trust, robustness, and efficiency in language-based and general AI systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5855d37f295085befc3229026050eb904450d261,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5855d37f295085befc3229026050eb904450d261,Big Data and Cognitive Computing,Computer Science,0,0d8a32befb1dd7aab45d7d3f8efa0c71,10.3390/bdcc9080193,,"[{'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00,2025-09-30 00:45:40.147869+00:00

Stocking, Ian Chuang, Claire Tomlin",2025,"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5).

While recent work has shown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction attacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been systematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a network's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the model works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate system. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from scratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is private and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious server), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and attention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits. Our findings reveal that obfuscation dramatically alters activation patterns within attention heads yet preserves the layer-wise computational graph. This disconnect hampers reverse-engineering of user prompts: causal traces lose their alignment with baseline semantics, and token-level logit attributions become too noisy to reconstruct. At the same time, feed-forward and residual pathways remain functionally intact, suggesting that obfuscation degrades fine-grained interpretability without compromising top-level task performance. These results establish quantitative evidence that architectural obfuscation can simultaneously (i) retain global model behaviour and (ii) impede mechanistic analyses of user-specific content.

By dissecting the network's inner workings, we identified fundamental features like maze walls and pathways, forming the basis of the model's decision-making process. A significant observation was the goal misgeneralization, where the RL agent developed biases towards certain navigation strategies, such as consistently moving towards the top right corner, even in the absence of explicit goals. Using techniques like saliency mapping and feature mapping, we visualized these biases. We furthered this exploration with the development of novel tools for interactively exploring layer activations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a800bac1609408eb955625b7ce0df234d48d3845,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00867.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a800bac1609408eb955625b7ce0df234d48d3845,arXiv.org,"Computer Science, Computer Science",0,ff64df4544d96f3711ebfc6255e44f82,10.48550/arXiv.2411.00867,2411.00867,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",2025-09-29 20:01:19.456152+00:00,2025-09-29 20:01:48.743394+00:00
