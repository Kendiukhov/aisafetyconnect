5582bebed97947a41e3ddd9bd1f284b73f1648c2,Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-Based Localization,"Ramprasaath R. Selvaraju, Abhishek Das, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Michael Cogswell, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra",2016,"We propose a technique for producing ‘visual explanations’ for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent and explainable. Our approach—Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g.captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g.visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, all without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are robust to adversarial perturbations, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (e) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models learn to localize discriminative regions of input image. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names (Bau et al. in Computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017) to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a ‘stronger’ deep network from a ‘weaker’ one even when both make identical predictions.

Ma̧dry, Aleksandar Makelov, Ludwig Schmidt, Dimitris Tsipras, Adrian Vladu",2017,"Recent work has demonstrated that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples---inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data and yet classified incorrectly by the network. In fact, some of the latest findings suggest that the existence of adversarial attacks may be an inherent weakness of deep learning models. To address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much of the prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against any adversary. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest the notion of security against a first-order adversary as a natural and broad security guarantee. We believe that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models.

Aron, Rosalind E. Keith, S. Kirsh, Jeffery A. Alexander, J. Lowery",2009,"BackgroundMany interventions found to be effective in health services research studies fail to translate into meaningful patient care outcomes across multiple contexts. Health services researchers recognize the need to evaluate not only summative outcomes but also formative outcomes to assess the extent to which implementation is effective in a specific setting, prolongs sustainability, and promotes dissemination into other settings. Many implementation theories have been published to help promote effective implementation. However, they overlap considerably in the constructs included in individual theories, and a comparison of theories reveals that each is missing important constructs included in other theories. In addition, terminology and definitions are not consistent across theories. We describe the Consolidated Framework For Implementation Research (CFIR) that offers an overarching typology to promote implementation theory development and verification about what works where and why across multiple contexts.MethodsWe used a snowball sampling approach to identify published theories that were evaluated to identify constructs based on strength of conceptual or empirical support for influence on implementation, consistency in definitions, alignment with our own findings, and potential for measurement. We combined constructs across published theories that had different labels but were redundant or overlapping in definition, and we parsed apart constructs that conflated underlying concepts.ResultsThe CFIR is composed of five major domains: intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of the individuals involved, and the process of implementation. Eight constructs were identified related to the intervention (e.g., evidence strength and quality), four constructs were identified related to outer setting (e.g., patient needs and resources), 12 constructs were identified related to inner setting (e.g., culture, leadership engagement), five constructs were identified related to individual characteristics, and eight constructs were identified related to process (e.g., plan, evaluate, and reflect). We present explicit definitions for each construct.ConclusionThe CFIR provides a pragmatic structure for approaching complex, interacting, multi-level, and transient states of constructs in the real world by embracing, consolidating, and unifying key constructs from published implementation theories. It can be used to guide formative evaluations and build the implementation knowledge base across multiple studies and settings.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c780fb585f838c22f451906a4603414299fee434,https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1748-5908-4-50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c780fb585f838c22f451906a4603414299fee434,Implementation science : IS,"Medicine, Medicine",10582,af415d50a56ac7a09a27622554e30e18,10.1186/1748-5908-4-50,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00

In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.

df40ce107a71b770c9d0354b78fdd8989da80d2f,Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks,"Nicholas Carlini, D. Wagner",2016,"Neural networks provide state-of-the-art results for most machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: given an input x and any target classification t, it is possible to find a new input x' that is similar to x but classified as t. This makes it difficult to apply neural networks in security-critical areas. Defensive distillation is a recently proposed approach that can take an arbitrary neural network, and increase its robustness, reducing the success rate of current attacks' ability to find adversarial examples from 95% to 0.5%.In this paper, we demonstrate that defensive distillation does not significantly increase the robustness of neural networks by introducing three new attack algorithms that are successful on both distilled and undistilled neural networks with 100% probability. Our attacks are tailored to three distance metrics used previously in the literature, and when compared to previous adversarial example generation algorithms, our attacks are often much more effective (and never worse). Furthermore, we propose using high-confidence adversarial examples in a simple transferability test we show can also be used to break defensive distillation. We hope our attacks will be used as a benchmark in future defense attempts to create neural networks that resist adversarial examples.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/df40ce107a71b770c9d0354b78fdd8989da80d2f,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04644,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/df40ce107a71b770c9d0354b78fdd8989da80d2f,IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,"Computer Science, Computer Science",8941,218cbd0ddc0c07129ca8a6e57177fe24,10.1109/SP.2017.49,1608.04644,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

ddf303100649ad7c66d17119de7ac00b41e466d7,Accelerated Profile HMM Searches,S. Eddy,2011,"Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the “multiple segment Viterbi” (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call “sparse rescaling”. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ddf303100649ad7c66d17119de7ac00b41e466d7,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002195&type=printable,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ddf303100649ad7c66d17119de7ac00b41e466d7,PLoS Comput.

They can also improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias: recent adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation reduce the difference between the training and test domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. However, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) show compelling visualizations, they are not optimal on discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. On the other hand, discriminative approaches can handle larger domain shifts, but impose tied weights on the model and do not exploit a GAN-based loss. In this work, we first outline a novel generalized framework for adversarial adaptation, which subsumes recent state-of-the-art approaches as special cases, and use this generalized view to better relate prior approaches. We then propose a previously unexplored instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling, untied weight sharing, and a GAN loss, which we call Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA). We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably simpler than competing domain-adversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise of our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation results on standard domain adaptation tasks as well as a difficult cross-modality object classification task.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/345afa0e85cb2f5cb438ae44027499ff2c392409,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05464,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/345afa0e85cb2f5cb438ae44027499ff2c392409,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Computer Science, Computer Science",4821,170c9e352517135daa97bcf7ca1228de,10.1109/CVPR.2017.316,1702.05464,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

Zonca",2018,"Observations of the submillimetre emission from Galactic dust, in both total intensityIand polarization, have received tremendous interest thanks to thePlanckfull-sky maps. In this paper we make use of such full-sky maps of dust polarized emission produced from the third public release ofPlanckdata. As the basis for expanding on astrophysical studies of the polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust, we present full-sky maps of the dust polarization fractionp, polarization angleψ, and dispersion function of polarization angles 𝒮. The joint distribution (one-point statistics) ofpandNHconfirms that the mean and maximum polarization fractions decrease with increasingNH. The uncertainty on the maximum observed polarization fraction,pmax= 22.0−1.4+3.5% at 353 GHz and 80′ resolution, is dominated by the uncertainty on the Galactic emission zero level in total intensity, in particular towards diffuse lines of sight at high Galactic latitudes. Furthermore, the inverse behaviour betweenpand 𝒮 found earlier is seen to be present at high latitudes. This follows the 𝒮 ∝ p−1relationship expected from models of the polarized sky (including numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence) that include effects from only the topology of the turbulent magnetic field, but otherwise have uniform alignment and dust properties. Thus, the statistical properties ofp,ψ, and 𝒮 for the most part reflect the structure of the Galactic magnetic field. Nevertheless, we search for potential signatures of varying grain alignment and dust properties. First, we analyse the product map 𝒮 × p, looking for residual trends. While the polarization fractionpdecreases by a factor of 3−4 betweenNH = 1020 cm−2andNH = 2 × 1022 cm−2, out of the Galactic plane, this product 𝒮 × ponly decreases by about 25%. Because 𝒮 is independent of the grain alignment efficiency, this demonstrates that the systematic decrease inpwithNHis determined mostly by the magnetic-field structure and not by a drop in grain alignment. This systematic trend is observed both in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and in molecular clouds of the Gould Belt. Second, we look for a dependence of polarization properties on the dust temperature, as we would expect from the radiative alignment torque (RAT) theory. We find no systematic trend of 𝒮 × pwith the dust temperatureTd, whether in the diffuse ISM or in the molecular clouds of the Gould Belt. In the diffuse ISM, lines of sight with high polarization fractionpand low polarization angle dispersion 𝒮 tend, on the contrary, to have colder dust than lines of sight with lowpand high 𝒮. We also compare thePlanckthermal dust polarization with starlight polarization data in the visible at high Galactic latitudes. The agreement in polarization angles is remarkable, and is consistent with what we expect from the noise and the observed dispersion of polarization angles in the visible on the scale of thePlanckbeam. The two polarization emission-to-extinction ratios,RP/pandRS/V, which primarily characterize dust optical properties, have only a weak dependence on the column density, and converge towards the values previously determined for translucent lines of sight. We also determine an upper limit for the polarization fraction in extinction,pV/E(B − V), of 13% at high Galactic latitude, compatible with the polarization fractionp ≈ 20% observed at 353 GHz. Taken together, these results provide strong constraints for models of Galactic dust in diffuse gas.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e93c1c323a3f2f001595d9279ea9b874406b7994,https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2020/09/aa33885-18.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e93c1c323a3f2f001595d9279ea9b874406b7994,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Physics, Physics",4407,eddb774ca3a987cc962a9d14ee25bcab,10.1051/0004-6361/201833885,1807.06212,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00

Dietterich",2019,"In this paper we establish rigorous benchmarks for image classifier robustness. Our first benchmark, ImageNet-C, standardizes and expands the corruption robustness topic, while showing which classifiers are preferable in safety-critical applications. Then we propose a new dataset called ImageNet-P which enables researchers to benchmark a classifier's robustness to common perturbations. Unlike recent robustness research, this benchmark evaluates performance on common corruptions and perturbations not worst-case adversarial perturbations.

However, existing approaches have limited scalability and robustness in handling more than two domains, since different models should be built independently for every pair of image domains. To address this limitation, we propose StarGAN, a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to StarGAN's superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain.

New York: Penguin Press, 2011. 294 pp. ISBN: 978-0-670-92038-9 “We’re not evil. We try really hard not to be evil. But if we wanted to, man, could we ever.” An unnamed Google engineer, interviewed in The Filter Bubble. In 1991, Mark Weiser wrote, “the most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it... The constant background presence of these products...does not require active attention...It [becomes] difficult to imagine modern life otherwise” (p. 94). Weiser, a Xerox PARC researcher, would witness the personal computing revolution from an epicenter of technological innovation. Though Weiser’s article did not necessarily anticipate the impact of search engines, “Computing in the 21 st Century,” would prove prescient. More than twenty years after Weiser’s publication, Eli Pariser’s The Filter Bubble examines the unintended consequences of web personalization: technologies which, while not disappearing into society’s fabric, are growing ubiquitous, and therefore less visible in our critical evaluation of information. Pariser’s svelte, readable book is less a polemic and more a work of consumer advocacy. In eight chapters, he examines the cost of personalized intellectual environments from the perspective of many stakeholders: everyday searchers, scholars, Google engineers, marketers, and even national security agents. He argues that search settings and social media allow us to pre-sanitize our information environments without our full realization of the lost information channels. Millions of metrics — from our Facebook ""likes"" to our aggregated history of selected banner ads — accrue into an algorithmic profile of encounter information we deem unpleasant or objectionable. The resulting bubble deflects various new information sources, while still promoting the illusion of comprehensive search. The potential cost is not just anathema to good search, but to the foundations of an informed citizenry. The web we navigate navigates us. Google tracks our searches, engineering ""personalized"" results, which are tailored to our supposed needs. Facebook aggregates our likes, login times, and other metrics to target advertisements. Amazon has built a digital empire on its alchemy of stored consumer behavior, purchase correlation research, and predictive marketing. Marketers have an enormous appetite for data that can help them send the right ad at the right time to prospective consumers. The more aggregated information advertisers can find, the most numbers they can sift. Various algorithms can correlate interests or preferences that many experts would never imagine (Pariser cites the Netflix algorithm Cinematch, which accurately predicted that people who liked Silence of the Lambs typically liked The Wizard of Oz).

This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. 
The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between ""hand-engineering"" and ""end-to-end"" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3a58efcc4558727cc5c131c44923635da4524f33,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01261.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3a58efcc4558727cc5c131c44923635da4524f33,arXiv.org,"Mathematics, Computer Science, Computer Science",3256,70564d9eb716977f401192a79c5b0258,,1806.01261,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:43:58.858318+00:00,2025-10-22 22:43:58.858318+00:00

Goodfellow, Samy Bengio",2016,"Adversarial examples are malicious inputs designed to fool machine learning models. They often transfer from one model to another, allowing attackers to mount black box attacks without knowledge of the target model's parameters. Adversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on adversarial examples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce its test error on clean inputs. So far, adversarial training has primarily been applied to small problems. In this research, we apply adversarial training to ImageNet. Our contributions include: (1) recommendations for how to succesfully scale adversarial training to large models and datasets, (2) the observation that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods, (3) the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than single-step attack methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting black-box attacks, and (4) resolution of a ""label leaking"" effect that causes adversarially trained models to perform better on adversarial examples than on clean examples, because the adversarial example construction process uses the true label and the model can learn to exploit regularities in the construction process.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2a85a6766b982ff7c8980e57ca6342d22493827,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01236.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2a85a6766b982ff7c8980e57ca6342d22493827,International Conference on Learning Representations,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",3228,969823af45e93f483ce60c6d70b8bfca,,1611.01236,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

Swami",2015,"Deep learning algorithms have been shown to perform extremely well on many classical machine learning problems. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 1030. We also find that distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we tested.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6adf016e7531c91100d3cf4a74f5d4c87b26b528,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04508,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6adf016e7531c91100d3cf4a74f5d4c87b26b528,IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",3132,bed4a064e97a7942094d765be81f90a3,10.1109/SP.2016.41,1511.04508,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

(2018) introduced a new task of commonsense natural language inference: given an event description such as “A woman sits at a piano,” a machine must select the most likely followup: “She sets her fingers on the keys.” With the introduction of BERT, near human-level performance was reached. Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense inference? In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans (>95% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (<48%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical ‘Goldilocks’ zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models. Our construction of HellaSwag, and its resulting difficulty, sheds light on the inner workings of deep pretrained models.

Adversarial attacks serve as an important surrogate to evaluate the robustness of deep learning models before they are deployed. However, most of existing adversarial attacks can only fool a black-box model with a low success rate. To address this issue, we propose a broad class of momentum-based iterative algorithms to boost adversarial attacks. By integrating the momentum term into the iterative process for attacks, our methods can stabilize update directions and escape from poor local maxima during the iterations, resulting in more transferable adversarial examples. To further improve the success rates for black-box attacks, we apply momentum iterative algorithms to an ensemble of models, and show that the adversarially trained models with a strong defense ability are also vulnerable to our black-box attacks. We hope that the proposed methods will serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of various deep models and defense methods.

Virtual adversarial loss is defined as the robustness of the conditional label distribution around each input data point against local perturbation. Unlike adversarial training, our method defines the adversarial direction without label information and is hence applicable to semi-supervised learning. Because the directions in which we smooth the model are only “virtually” adversarial, we call our method virtual adversarial training (VAT). The computational cost of VAT is relatively low. For neural networks, the approximated gradient of virtual adversarial loss can be computed with no more than two pairs of forward- and back-propagations. In our experiments, we applied VAT to supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks on multiple benchmark datasets.

Mcdaniel",2017,"Adversarial examples are perturbed inputs designed to fool machine learning models. Adversarial training injects such examples into training data to increase robustness. To scale this technique to large datasets, perturbations are crafted using fast single-step methods that maximize a linear approximation of the model's loss. We show that this form of adversarial training converges to a degenerate global minimum, wherein small curvature artifacts near the data points obfuscate a linear approximation of the loss. The model thus learns to generate weak perturbations, rather than defend against strong ones. As a result, we find that adversarial training remains vulnerable to black-box attacks, where we transfer perturbations computed on undefended models, as well as to a powerful novel single-step attack that escapes the non-smooth vicinity of the input data via a small random step. We further introduce Ensemble Adversarial Training, a technique that augments training data with perturbations transferred from other models. On ImageNet, Ensemble Adversarial Training yields models with strong robustness to black-box attacks.

Nurtay, Lucie Abeler-Dörner, Michael J Parker, D. Bonsall, C. Fraser",2020,"Instantaneous contact tracing New analyses indicate that severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is more infectious and less virulent than the earlier SARS-CoV-1, which emerged in China in 2002. Unfortunately, the current virus has greater epidemic potential because it is difficult to trace mild or presymptomatic infections. As no treatment is currently available, the only tools that we can currently deploy to stop the epidemic are contact tracing, social distancing, and quarantine, all of which are slow to implement. However imperfect the data, the current global emergency requires more timely interventions. Ferretti et al. explored the feasibility of protecting the population (that is, achieving transmission below the basic reproduction number) using isolation coupled with classical contact tracing by questionnaires versus algorithmic instantaneous contact tracing assisted by a mobile phone application. For prevention, the crucial information is understanding the relative contributions of different routes of transmission. A phone app could show how finite resources must be divided between different intervention strategies for the most effective control. Science, this issue p. eabb6936 Instantaneous contact tracing and notifications by mobile phone app could potentially stop the COVID-19 epidemic. INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has clear potential for a long-lasting global pandemic, high fatality rates, and incapacitated health systems. Until vaccines are widely available, the only available infection prevention approaches are case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, physical distancing, decontamination, and hygiene measures. To implement the right measures at the right time, it is of crucial importance to understand the routes and timings of transmission. RATIONALE We used key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes with a renewal equation formulation, and analytically determined the speed and scale for effective identification and contact tracing required to stop the epidemic. RESULTS We developed a mathematical model for infectiousness to estimate the basic reproductive number R0 and to quantify the contribution of different transmission routes. To parameterize the model, we analyzed 40 well-characterized source-recipient pairs and estimated the distribution of generation times (time from infection to onward transmission). The distribution had a median of 5.0 days and standard deviation of 1.9 days. We used published parameters for the incubation time distribution (median 5.2 days) and the epidemic doubling time (5.0 days) from the early epidemic data in China. The model estimated R0 = 2.0 in the early stages of the epidemic in China. The contributions to R0 included 46% from presymptomatic individuals (before showing symptoms), 38% from symptomatic individuals, 10% from asymptomatic individuals (who never show symptoms), and 6% from environmentally mediated transmission via contamination. Results on the last two routes are speculative. According to these estimates, presymptomatic transmissions alone are almost sufficient to sustain epidemic growth. To estimate the requirements for successful contact tracing, we determined the combination of two key parameters needed to reduce R0 to less than 1: the proportion of cases who need to be isolated, and the proportion of their contacts who need to be quarantined. For a 3-day delay in notification assumed for manual contact tracing, no parameter combination leads to epidemic control. Immediate notification through a contact-tracing mobile phone app could, however, be sufficient to stop the epidemic if used by a sufficiently high proportion of the population. We propose an app, based on existing technology, that allows instant contact tracing. Proximity events between two phones running the app are recorded. Upon an individual’s COVID-19 diagnosis, contacts are instantly, automatically, and anonymously notified of their risk and asked to self-isolate. Practical and logistical factors (e.g., uptake, coverage, R0 in a given population) will determine whether an app is sufficient to control viral spread on its own, or whether additional measures to reduce R0 (e.g., physical distancing) are required. The performance of the app in scenarios with higher values of R0 can be explored at https://bdi-pathogens.shinyapps.io/covid-19-transmission-routes/. CONCLUSION Given the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 and the high proportion of transmissions from presymptomatic individuals, controlling the epidemic by manual contact tracing is infeasible. The use of a contact-tracing app that builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases would be sufficient to stop the epidemic if used by enough people, in particular when combined with other measures such as physical distancing. An intervention of this kind raises ethical questions regarding access, transparency, the protection and use of personal data, and the sharing of knowledge with other countries. Careful oversight by an inclusive advisory body is required. Instant contact tracing can reduce the proportion of cases that need to be isolated and contacts who need to be quarantined to achieve control of an epidemic. Subject A becomes symptomatic after having had contact with other people in different settings the day before. Contacts are notified and quarantined where needed. In the inset, the green area indicates the success rates needed to control an epidemic with R0 = 2 (i.e., negative growth rates after isolating cases and quarantining their contacts). The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2) is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems. Preventing further transmission is a priority. We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact tracing needed to stop the epidemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 is spreading too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, it could be controlled if this process were faster, more efficient, and happened at scale. A contact-tracing app that builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without resorting to mass quarantines (“lockdowns”) that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31fb4ea7a135c545c8d79e78b72a02a4ebf32e61,https://www.science.org/cms/asset/b6b9e1f8-d230-4fb2-9021-f0ab83d9ad74/pap.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31fb4ea7a135c545c8d79e78b72a02a4ebf32e61,Science,"Computer Science, Medicine, Medicine, Environmental Science, Computer Science",2408,80a56dc2fbfe0e341d6a32a58e9660eb,10.1126/science.abb6936,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:54:02.232968+00:00,2025-10-22 22:54:02.232968+00:00

Sakurai",2017,"Recent research has revealed that the output of deep neural networks (DNNs) can be easily altered by adding relatively small perturbations to the input vector. In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution (DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results show that 67.97% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03% and 22.91% confidence on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating robustness.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6f835ca6e12245a835ab6074bc6ec2c3c60b85a,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08864,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6f835ca6e12245a835ab6074bc6ec2c3c60b85a,IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",2395,fd1db266b64a9f31ec6150fbeadd7896,10.1109/TEVC.2019.2890858,1710.08864,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

Unlike what has been developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data, self-supervised learning and pre-training are less explored for GNNs. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) framework for learning unsupervised representations of graph data. We first design four types of graph augmentations to incorporate various priors. We then systematically study the impact of various combinations of graph augmentations on multiple datasets, in four different settings: semi-supervised, unsupervised, and transfer learning as well as adversarial attacks. The results show that, even without tuning augmentation extents nor using sophisticated GNN architectures, our GraphCL framework can produce graph representations of similar or better generalizability, transferrability, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Gawer",2018,"Research Summary: The recent surge of interest in “ecosystems” in strategy research and practice has mainly focused on what ecosystems are and how they operate. We complement this literature by considering when and why ecosystems emerge, and what makes them distinct from other governance forms. We argue that modularity enables ecosystem emergence as it allows a set of distinct yet interdependent organizations to coordinate without full hierarchical fiat. We show how ecosystems address multilateral dependences based on various types of complementarities—supermodular or unique, unidirectional or bidirectional—which determine the ecosystem's value‐add. We argue that at the core of ecosystems lie nongeneric complementarities, and the creation of sets of roles that face similar rules. We conclude with implications for mainstream strategy and suggestions for future research. Managerial Summary: We consider what makes ecosystems different from other business constellations, including markets, alliances, or hierarchically managed supply chains. Ecosystems, we posit, are interacting organizations, enabled by modularity, not hierarchically managed, bound together by the nonredeployability of their collective investment elsewhere. Ecosystems add value as they allow managers to coordinate their multilateral dependence through sets of roles that face similar rules, thus obviating the need to enter into customized contractual agreements with each partner. We explain how different types of complementarities (unique or supermodular, generic or specific, uni‐ or bi‐directional) shape ecosystems and offer a “theory of ecosystems” that can explain what they are, when they emerge, and why alignment occurs. Finally, we outline the critical factors affecting ecosystem emergence, evolution, and success—or failure.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea08f63bf14c9a1634da65aa3d57b412c772a0a2,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/smj.2904,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea08f63bf14c9a1634da65aa3d57b412c772a0a2,Strategic Management Journal,"Medicine, Environmental Science",2230,4ef2892ba6341505b6668aace8929c74,10.2139/ssrn.3218233,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00

However, deep neural networks with the softmax classifier are known to produce highly overconfident posterior distributions even for such abnormal samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for detecting any abnormal samples, which is applicable to any pre-trained softmax neural classifier. We obtain the class conditional Gaussian distributions with respect to (low- and upper-level) features of the deep models under Gaussian discriminant analysis, which result in a confidence score based on the Mahalanobis distance. While most prior methods have been evaluated for detecting either out-of-distribution or adversarial samples, but not both, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances for both cases in our experiments. Moreover, we found that our proposed method is more robust in harsh cases, e.g., when the training dataset has noisy labels or small number of samples. Finally, we show that the proposed method enjoys broader usage by applying it to class-incremental learning: whenever out-of-distribution samples are detected, our classification rule can incorporate new classes well without further training deep models.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d03ca175e2b2745126e792fdc31dfadae4c63afa,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03888.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d03ca175e2b2745126e792fdc31dfadae4c63afa,Neural Information Processing Systems,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",2226,e204a6f3187ce0b76e1179c22d0e97e9,,1807.03888,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

This ""randomized smoothing"" technique has been proposed recently in the literature, but existing guarantees are loose. We prove a tight robustness guarantee in $\ell_2$ norm for smoothing with Gaussian noise. We use randomized smoothing to obtain an ImageNet classifier with e.g. a certified top-1 accuracy of 49% under adversarial perturbations with $\ell_2$ norm less than 0.5 (=127/255). No certified defense has been shown feasible on ImageNet except for smoothing. On smaller-scale datasets where competing approaches to certified $\ell_2$ robustness are viable, smoothing delivers higher certified accuracies. Our strong empirical results suggest that randomized smoothing is a promising direction for future research into adversarially robust classification.

Many promising defenses could be broken later on, making it difficult to identify the state-of-the-art. Frequent pitfalls in the evaluation are improper tuning of hyperparameters of the attacks, gradient obfuscation or masking. In this paper we first propose two extensions of the PGD-attack overcoming failures due to suboptimal step size and problems of the objective function. We then combine our novel attacks with two complementary existing ones to form a parameter-free, computationally affordable and user-independent ensemble of attacks to test adversarial robustness. We apply our ensemble to over 50 models from papers published at recent top machine learning and computer vision venues.

However, recent research on DNNs has indicated ever-increasing concern on the robustness to adversarial examples, especially for security-critical tasks such as traffic sign identification for autonomous driving. Studies have unveiled the vulnerability of a well-trained DNN by demonstrating the ability of generating barely noticeable (to both human and machines) adversarial images that lead to misclassification. Furthermore, researchers have shown that these adversarial images are highly transferable by simply training and attacking a substitute model built upon the target model, known as a black-box attack to DNNs. Similar to the setting of training substitute models, in this paper we propose an effective black-box attack that also only has access to the input (images) and the output (confidence scores) of a targeted DNN. However, different from leveraging attack transferability from substitute models, we propose zeroth order optimization (ZOO) based attacks to directly estimate the gradients of the targeted DNN for generating adversarial examples. We use zeroth order stochastic coordinate descent along with dimension reduction, hierarchical attack and importance sampling techniques to efficiently attack black-box models. By exploiting zeroth order optimization, improved attacks to the targeted DNN can be accomplished, sparing the need for training substitute models and avoiding the loss in attack transferability. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the proposed ZOO attack is as effective as the state-of-the-art white-box attack (e.g., Carlini and Wagner's attack) and significantly outperforms existing black-box attacks via substitute models.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ab7319dbe80549ba80e3320d0546d741a7a5791,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03999,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ab7319dbe80549ba80e3320d0546d741a7a5791,AISec@CCS,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, Computer Science, Engineering",1996,cc88144701c57a0e5efa30abb4dcf411,10.1145/3128572.3140448,1708.03999,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

Song",2018,"Recent studies show that the state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, resulting from small-magnitude perturbations added to the input. Given that that emerging physical systems are using DNNs in safety-critical situations, adversarial examples could mislead these systems and cause dangerous situations. Therefore, understanding adversarial examples in the physical world is an important step towards developing resilient learning algorithms. We propose a general attack algorithm, Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2), to generate robust visual adversarial perturbations under different physical conditions. Using the real-world case of road sign classification, we show that adversarial examples generated using RP2 achieve high targeted misclassification rates against standard-architecture road sign classifiers in the physical world under various environmental conditions, including viewpoints. Due to the current lack of a standardized testing method, we propose a two-stage evaluation methodology for robust physical adversarial examples consisting of lab and field tests. Using this methodology, we evaluate the efficacy of physical adversarial manipulations on real objects. With a perturbation in the form of only black and white stickers, we attack a real stop sign, causing targeted misclassification in 100% of the images obtained in lab settings, and in 84.8% of the captured video frames obtained on a moving vehicle (field test) for the target classifier.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0c5991dbb130fa6b5de011cf7a04f6ed815ef68,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0c5991dbb130fa6b5de011cf7a04f6ed815ef68,2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Computer Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics",1943,7966e50d3a4c364193bb1e5b45ecb311,10.1109/CVPR.2018.00175,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Engineering'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

These findings also corroborate a similar phenomenon observed empirically in more complex settings.

We prove statistical error rates for three kinds of population loss functions: strongly convex, non-strongly convex, and smooth non-convex. In particular, these algorithms are shown to achieve order-optimal statistical error rates for strongly convex losses.

Crucially, we show that the dual problem to this linear program can be represented itself as a deep network similar to the backpropagation network, leading to very efficient optimization approaches that produce guaranteed bounds on the robust loss. The end result is that by executing a few more forward and backward passes through a slightly modified version of the original network (though possibly with much larger batch sizes), we can learn a classifier that is provably robust to any norm-bounded adversarial attack. We illustrate the approach on a toy 2D robust classification task, and on a simple convolutional architecture applied to MNIST, where we produce a classifier that provably has less than 8.4% test error for any adversarial attack with bounded $\ell_\infty$ norm less than $\epsilon = 0.1$. This represents the largest verified network that we are aware of, and we discuss future challenges in scaling the approach to much larger domains.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b23012689e0f17912fb38d4984775e567cff8d6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00851.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b23012689e0f17912fb38d4984775e567cff8d6,International Conference on Machine Learning,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Mathematics",1529,857e524e230a8ca508c3bce58917ccf4,,1711.00851,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Mathematics'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

1b225474e7a5794f98cdfbde8b12ccbc56799409,Decision-Based Adversarial Attacks: Reliable Attacks Against Black-Box Machine Learning Models,"Wieland Brendel, Jonas Rauber, M. Bethge",2017,"Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. So far it was unclear how much risk adversarial perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications because most methods used to generate such perturbations rely either on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com. The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in general open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems. An implementation of the attack is available as part of Foolbox at this https URL .",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b225474e7a5794f98cdfbde8b12ccbc56799409,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04248.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b225474e7a5794f98cdfbde8b12ccbc56799409,International Conference on Learning Representations,"Mathematics, Computer Science, Computer Science",1393,70d56b4397359cb635606a305e2dfdf9,,1712.04248,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

Such a distribution mismatch will lead to a significant performance drop. In this work, we aim to improve the cross-domain robustness of object detection. We tackle the domain shift on two levels: 1) the image-level shift, such as image style, illumination, etc., and 2) the instance-level shift, such as object appearance, size, etc. We build our approach based on the recent state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN model, and design two domain adaptation components, on image level and instance level, to reduce the domain discrepancy. The two domain adaptation components are based on $$-divergence theory, and are implemented by learning a domain classifier in adversarial training manner. The domain classifiers on different levels are further reinforced with a consistency regularization to learn a domain-invariant region proposal network (RPN) in the Faster R-CNN model.

Başar",2019,"Recent years have witnessed significant advances in reinforcement learning (RL), which has registered great success in solving various sequential decision-making problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL applications, e.g., the games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous driving, involve the participation of more than one single agent, which naturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain with a relatively long history, and has recently re-emerged due to advances in single-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical foundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter, we provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by theoretical analysis. More specifically, we review the theoretical results of MARL algorithms mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic games and extensive-form games, in accordance with the types of tasks they address, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We also introduce several significant but challenging applications of these algorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several new angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form games, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-field regime, (non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of the new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our overall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the current state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research directions on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as continuing stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting while challenging topic.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/54d4a221db5a91a2487b1610374843fafff5a23d,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10635.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/54d4a221db5a91a2487b1610374843fafff5a23d,Handbook of Reinforcement Learning and Control,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",1346,eba9bd89d5e5ed3fd54cc25029de3539,10.1007/978-3-030-60990-0_12,1911.10635,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:30:09.393246+00:00,2025-10-22 22:30:09.393246+00:00

As the dimension of the material is reduced, such that the atoms are in a single monolayer, it was widely believed that thermal fluctuations overwhelm and prevent magnetic ordering. Gong and Zhang review the developments that have followed the recent discovery of magnetism in two-dimensional materials. Recognizing that magnetic anisotropy can be used to induce stable magnetism in atomic monolayers, they provide an overview of the materials available and the physical understanding of the effects and then discuss how these effects could be exploited for widespread practical applications. Science, this issue p. eaav4450 BACKGROUND The electron can be considered as a tiny magnet, with two opposite poles defining its magnetic field associated with the spin and orbital motion. When such minuscule magnets are collectively aligned as a result of the inherent coupling, ferromagnetism emerges. However, ferromagnetism had long been believed to hardly survive in two-dimensional (2D) systems because of the enhanced thermal fluctuations revealed by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The recent discovery of 2D magnetic crystals showed that magnetic anisotropy could stabilize the long-range magnetic order by opening up an excitation gap to resist the thermal agitation. Two-dimensional magnetic crystals constitute ideal platforms to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism in reduced dimensions. In contrast to the traditional magnetic thin films, 2D materials largely decouple from the substrates, allow electrical control, are mechanically flexible, and are open to chemical functionalization. These attributes make 2D magnets accessible, engineerable, and integrable into emergent heterostructures for previously unachieved properties and applications such as atomically thin magneto-optical and magnetoelectric devices for ultracompact spintronics, on-chip optical communications, and quantum computing. ADVANCES Magnetism has been explored in 2D materials for more than a decade. Magnetic moments have been created through defect engineering based on vacancies, adatoms, boundaries, and edges; band structure engineering, assisted by density functional theory calculations, has raised possibilities of 2D magnetism in, for instance, gated bilayer graphene and doped GaSe; the proximity effect has been applied to imprint spin polarization in 2D materials from magnetic substrates. However, these prior efforts centered on extrinsically induced magnetic response. In early 2017, the first observations of long-range magnetic order in pristine 2D crystals were reported in Cr2Ge2Te6 and CrI3. Both are magnetic insulators, yet with distinct magnetic properties. In contrast, 2D Fe3GeTe2 was recently proven to be a magnetic conductor. Itinerant magnets and magnetic insulators possess diverse application perspectives. Molecular beam epitaxial growth of 2D magnets has been reported for Fe3GeTe2, VSe2, MnSex, and Cr2Ge2Te6. The typical Curie temperatures of 2D magnets are much lower than those of their 3D counterparts. However, this does not fundamentally exclude the possibility of high-temperature 2D magnets. Efforts toward this goal have shown promise. When van der Waals (vdW) magnets contact nonmagnetic materials, time reversal asymmetry could be introduced in the original nonmagnets, likely leading to, for example, valley polarization in transition metal dichalcogenides or quantum anomalous Hall states in topological insulators. However, it should be noted that 2D magnets’ properties are susceptible to the contacting materials. Stacking vdW magnets with dissimilar materials could enrich the landscape of emergent phenomena by causing, for example, heterostructure multiferroicity, unconventional superconductivity, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Two-dimensional spintronic and magnonic devices have begun to emerge. Spin-orbit torque has been generated while spin-polarized current is injected from 2D materials (e.g., WTe2) into magnetic substrates; conversely, a spin wave has been pumped from magnetic substrates into 2D materials for spin-charge conversion. Magnetic tunnel junctions with 2D magnets (e.g., CrI3) as tunneling barriers exhibit giant tunneling magnetoresistance at low temperatures. New concepts of spin field-effect transistors based on 2D magnets have been reported as well. OUTLOOK Most currently available 2D magnets rely on mechanical exfoliation and only work at low temperatures. The wafer-scale synthesis of 2D magnets that operate above room temperature is a prerequisite for the development of practical applications. In the longer run, the monolithic integration of such 2D magnets with other functional materials is crucial for practical scalability. Spintronic devices require efficient electrical modulation of 2D magnets, long-distance transport of spins or spin waves, and efficient tunneling and injection of spins at various junctions. The practical development of low-power spintronic devices needs to be compatible with the existing complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology (e.g., impedance match and affordable power supply). Furthermore, the exotic spin textures, quantum phases, and quasiparticles in 2D magnetic crystals and hetero-interfaces could lead to new ways of computation and communication. We envision that successive breakthroughs in 2D magnets could usher in a new era of information technologies with exciting applications in computing, sensing, and data storage. Two-dimensional magnetic crystals: The atomically thin crystalline hosts of magneto-optic and magnetoelectric effects. 2D magnetic crystals, including 2D ferromagnets (left) and 2D antiferromagnets with diverse intra- and interplane magnetic configurations (right), can exhibit a plethora of magneto-optic and magnetoelectric effects. The red and blue protrusions in the atomic Lego depict the opposite local spins in magnetic layers. Magnetism, originating from the moving charges and spin of elementary particles, has revolutionized important technologies such as data storage and biomedical imaging, and continues to bring forth new phenomena in emergent materials and reduced dimensions. The recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals crystals provide ideal platforms for understanding 2D magnetism, the control of which has been fueling opportunities for atomically thin, flexible magneto-optic and magnetoelectric devices (such as magnetoresistive memories and spin field-effect transistors). The seamless integration of 2D magnets with dissimilar electronic and photonic materials opens up exciting possibilities for unprecedented properties and functionalities. We review the progress in this area and identify the possible directions for device applications, which may lead to advances in spintronics, sensors, and computing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3e4fd33080e83fc42c759baf62851758b25dab8,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6428/eaav4450.full.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b3e4fd33080e83fc42c759baf62851758b25dab8,Science,"Materials Science, Medicine, Physics, Materials Science",1280,e6fb0802d2440c1a0ad8828501b2969a,10.1126/science.aav4450,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Materials Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Physics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Materials Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00

Taillieu",2007,"Natural resources management in general, and water resources management in particular, are currently undergoing a major paradigm shift. Management practices have largely been developed and implemented by experts using technical means based on designing systems that can be predicted and controlled. In recent years, stakeholder involvement has gained increasing importance. Collaborative governance is considered to be more appropriate for integrated and adaptive management regimes needed to cope with the complexity of social-ecological systems. The paper presents a concept for social learning and collaborative governance developed in the European project HarmoniCOP (Harmonizing COllaborative Planning). The concept is rooted in the more interpretive strands of the social sciences emphasizing the context dependence of knowledge. The role of frames and boundary management in processes of learning at different levels and time scales is investigated. The foundation of social learning as investigated in the HarmoniCOP project is multiparty collaboration processes that are perceived to be the nuclei of learning processes. Such processes take place in networks or “communities of practice” and are influenced by the governance structure in which they are embedded. Requirements for social learning include institutional settings that guarantee some degree of stability and certainty without being rigid and inflexible. Our analyses, which are based on conceptual considerations and empirical insights, suggest that the development of such institutional settings involves continued processes of social learning. In these processes, stakeholders at different scales are connected in flexible networks that allow them to develop the capacity and trust they need to collaborate in a wide range of formal and informal relationships ranging from formal legal structures and contracts to informal, voluntary agreements.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/122087a8aea4c8180f31533f652b7167bc8cab0f,http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol12/iss2/art5/ES-2007-2037.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/122087a8aea4c8180f31533f652b7167bc8cab0f,,"Chemistry, Economics, Environmental Science, Education, Sociology",1253,a26df6e7f4964286cb2d5be408939af4,10.5751/ES-02037-120205,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Chemistry'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Economics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Education'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Sociology'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:57:19.170426+00:00,2025-10-22 22:57:19.170426+00:00

Gong",2019,"In federated learning, multiple client devices jointly learn a machine learning model: each client device maintains a local model for its local training dataset, while a master device maintains a global model via aggregating the local models from the client devices. The machine learning community recently proposed several federated learning methods that were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures (e.g., system failures, adversarial manipulations) of certain client devices. In this work, we perform the first systematic study on local model poisoning attacks to federated learning. We assume an attacker has compromised some client devices, and the attacker manipulates the local model parameters on the compromised client devices during the learning process such that the global model has a large testing error rate. We formulate our attacks as optimization problems and apply our attacks to four recent Byzantine-robust federated learning methods. Our empirical results on four real-world datasets show that our attacks can substantially increase the error rates of the models learnt by the federated learning methods that were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures of some client devices. We generalize two defenses for data poisoning attacks to defend against our local model poisoning attacks. Our evaluation results show that one defense can effectively defend against our attacks in some cases, but the defenses are not effective enough in other cases, highlighting the need for new defenses against our local model poisoning attacks to federated learning.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a1574ce29eec463bd3e0b50b82157f3e5a1f81d,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11815.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a1574ce29eec463bd3e0b50b82157f3e5a1f81d,USENIX Security Symposium,"Computer Science, Computer Science",1252,e999b894f3af067082ec2e69a6e84e76,,1911.11815,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

Kolter",2020,"Adversarial training, a method for learning robust deep networks, is typically assumed to be more expensive than traditional training due to the necessity of constructing adversarial examples via a first-order method like projected gradient decent (PGD). In this paper, we make the surprising discovery that it is possible to train empirically robust models using a much weaker and cheaper adversary, an approach that was previously believed to be ineffective, rendering the method no more costly than standard training in practice. Specifically, we show that adversarial training with the fast gradient sign method (FGSM), when combined with random initialization, is as effective as PGD-based training but has significantly lower cost. Furthermore we show that FGSM adversarial training can be further accelerated by using standard techniques for efficient training of deep networks, allowing us to learn a robust CIFAR10 classifier with 45% robust accuracy to PGD attacks with $\epsilon=8/255$ in 6 minutes, and a robust ImageNet classifier with 43% robust accuracy at $\epsilon=2/255$ in 12 hours, in comparison to past work based on ""free"" adversarial training which took 10 and 50 hours to reach the same respective thresholds.

Yuille",2018,"Though CNNs have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples --- crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to clean images. However, most of the existing adversarial attacks only achieve relatively low success rates under the challenging black-box setting, where the attackers have no knowledge of the model structure and parameters. To this end, we propose to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by creating diverse input patterns. Instead of only using the original images to generate adversarial examples, our method applies random transformations to the input images at each iteration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that the proposed attack method can generate adversarial examples that transfer much better to different networks than existing baselines. By evaluating our method against top defense solutions and official baselines from NIPS 2017 adversarial competition, the enhanced attack reaches an average success rate of 73.0%, which outperforms the top-1 attack submission in the NIPS competition by a large margin of 6.6%.

Actually, what the community lacks is a general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse scenarios. Due to the versatile capabilities they demonstrate, large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many researchers have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and have achieved significant progress. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey on LLM-based agents. We start by tracing the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs are suitable foundations for agents. Building upon this, we present a general framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored for different applications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of LLM-based agents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and human-agent cooperation.

Achaz",2020,"Here, we describe Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning (ASAP), a new method to build species partitions from single locus sequence alignments (i.e., barcode data sets). ASAP is efficient enough to split data sets as large 104 sequences into putative species in several minutes. Although grounded in evolutionary theory, ASAP is the implementation of a hierarchical clustering algorithm that only uses pairwise genetic distances, avoiding the computational burden of phylogenetic reconstruction. Importantly, ASAP proposes species partitions ranked by a new scoring system that uses no biological prior insight of intraspecific diversity. ASAP is a stand‐alone program that can be used either through a graphical web‐interface or that can be downloaded and compiled for local usage. We have assessed its power along with three others programs (ABGD, PTP and GMYC) on 10 real COI barcode data sets representing various degrees of challenge (from small and easy cases to large and complicated data sets). We also used Monte‐Carlo simulations of a multispecies coalescent framework to assess the strengths and weaknesses of ASAP and the other programs. Through these analyses, we demonstrate that ASAP has the potential to become a major tool for taxonomists as it proposes rapidly in a full graphical exploratory interface relevant species hypothesis as a first step of the integrative taxonomy process.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80acce3eb2c3d61d1ca414f09529f9620cc54aed,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03039819/file/Puillandre%20et%20al%202020.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80acce3eb2c3d61d1ca414f09529f9620cc54aed,Molecular Ecology Resources,"Biology, Medicine, Computer Science, Biology",1141,c9b47f1e46636e8988b771a12e418157,10.1111/1755-0998.13281,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00,2025-10-22 22:37:00.263161+00:00

Despite their proliferation, currently there is no study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they are likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model.We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c44f8e62d824bcda4f291c679a5518bbd4225f6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07984,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c44f8e62d824bcda4f291c679a5518bbd4225f6,Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",1122,0b4ccd0b2f0755f7136b5f7c9b999779,10.1145/3219819.3220078,1805.07984,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

While Next-Generation sequencing methods may produce reads up to several hundred bases long, SMS sequencing produces reads up to tens of kilobases long. Existing alignment methods are either too inefficient for high-throughput datasets, or not sensitive enough to align SMS reads, which have a higher error rate than Next-Generation sequencing. We describe the method BLASR (Basic Local Alignment with Successive Refinement) for mapping Single Molecule Sequencing (SMS) reads that are thousands of bases long, with divergence between the read and genome dominated by insertion and deletion error. The method is benchmarked using both simulated reads and reads from a bacterial sequencing project. We also present a combinatorial model of sequencing error that motivates why our approach is effective. The results indicate that it is possible to map SMS reads with high accuracy and speed.

Geschwind",2018,"INTRODUCTION Our understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BD), lags behind other fields of medicine. The diagnosis and study of these disorders currently depend on behavioral, symptomatic characterization. Defining genetic contributions to disease risk allows for biological, mechanistic understanding but is challenged by genetic complexity, polygenicity, and the lack of a cohesive neurobiological model to interpret findings. RATIONALE The transcriptome represents a quantitative phenotype that provides biological context for understanding the molecular pathways disrupted in major psychiatric disorders. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in a large cohort of cases and controls can advance our knowledge of the biology disrupted in each disorder and provide a foundational resource for integration with genomic and genetic data. RESULTS Analysis across multiple levels of transcriptomic organization—gene expression, local splicing, transcript isoform expression, and coexpression networks for both protein-coding and noncoding genes—provides an in-depth view of ASD, SCZ, and BD molecular pathology. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression in at least one disorder, including hundreds of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), most of which have unexplored functions but collectively exhibit patterns of selective constraint. Changes at the isoform level, as opposed to the gene level, show the largest effect sizes and genetic enrichment and the greatest disease specificity. We identified coexpression modules associated with each disorder, many with enrichment for cell type–specific markers, and several modules significantly dysregulated across all three disorders. These enabled parsing of down-regulated neuronal and synaptic components into a variety of cell type– and disease-specific signals, including multiple excitatory neuron and distinct interneuron modules with differential patterns of disease association, as well as common and rare genetic risk variant enrichment. The glial-immune signal demonstrates shared disruption of the blood-brain barrier and up-regulation of NFkB-associated genes, as well as disease-specific alterations in microglial-, astrocyte-, and interferon-response modules. A coexpression module associated with psychiatric medication exposure in SCZ and BD was enriched for activity-dependent immediate early gene pathways. To identify causal drivers, we integrated polygenic risk scores and performed a transcriptome-wide association study and summary-data–based Mendelian randomization. Candidate risk genes—5 in ASD, 11 in BD, and 64 in SCZ, including shared genes between SCZ and BD—are supported by multiple methods. These analyses begin to define a mechanistic basis for the composite activity of genetic risk variants. CONCLUSION Integration of RNA-seq and genetic data from ASD, SCZ, and BD provides a quantitative, genome-wide resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development at Resource.PsychENCODE.org. These data inform the molecular pathways and cell types involved, emphasizing the importance of splicing and isoform-level gene regulatory mechanisms in defining cell type and disease specificity, and, when integrated with genome-wide association studies, permit the discovery of candidate risk genes. The PsychENCODE cross-disorder transcriptomic resource. Human brain RNA-seq was integrated with genotypes across individuals with ASD, SCZ, BD, and controls, identifying pervasive dysregulation, including protein-coding, noncoding, splicing, and isoform-level changes. Systems-level and integrative genomic analyses prioritize previously unknown neurogenetic mechanisms and provide insight into the molecular neuropathology of these disorders. Most genetic risk for psychiatric disease lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing. However, comprehensive assessments of transcriptomic organization in diseased brains are limited. In this work, we integrated genotypes and RNA sequencing in brain samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, as well as controls. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest disease effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likely mediated by cis effects on brain expression. This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular pathology across three major psychiatric disorders provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52471c06b2bae00c08609f1f057c826a66b89ea0,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6420/eaat8127.full.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52471c06b2bae00c08609f1f057c826a66b89ea0,Science,"Biology, Medicine, Medicine, Psychology, Biology",996,94358079f0b9e1c318ba310b6f4b7a7d,10.1126/science.aat8127,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Biology'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Psychology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Biology'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:50:31.178565+00:00,2025-10-22 22:50:31.178565+00:00

We find that self-supervision can benefit robustness in a variety of ways, including robustness to adversarial examples, label corruption, and common input corruptions. Additionally, self-supervision greatly benefits out-of-distribution detection on difficult, near-distribution outliers, so much so that it exceeds the performance of fully supervised methods. These results demonstrate the promise of self-supervision for improving robustness and uncertainty estimation and establish these tasks as new axes of evaluation for future self-supervised learning research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db787640c9b42416ff8d7015546e667e58267177,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.12340.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db787640c9b42416ff8d7015546e667e58267177,Neural Information Processing Systems,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",988,844970b08b48986f85311a890e219711,,1906.12340,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

Steinhardt, Percy Liang",2018,"While neural networks have achieved high accuracy on standard image classification benchmarks, their accuracy drops to nearly zero in the presence of small adversarial perturbations to test inputs. Defenses based on regularization and adversarial training have been proposed, but often followed by new, stronger attacks that defeat these defenses. Can we somehow end this arms race? In this work, we study this problem for neural networks with one hidden layer. We first propose a method based on a semidefinite relaxation that outputs a certificate that for a given network and test input, no attack can force the error to exceed a certain value. Second, as this certificate is differentiable, we jointly optimize it with the network parameters, providing an adaptive regularizer that encourages robustness against all attacks. On MNIST, our approach produces a network and a certificate that no attack that perturbs each pixel by at most \epsilon = 0.1 can cause more than 35% test error.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/966e3c7a65ec75a6359b55c0cecaf3896d318432,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09344.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/966e3c7a65ec75a6359b55c0cecaf3896d318432,International Conference on Learning Representations,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",975,28975dfe114735ef0801a70daf7a4909,,1801.09344,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

Broto",2013,"In this paper, we argue for an approach that goes beyond an institutional reading of urban climate governance to engage with the ways in which government is accomplished through social and technical practices. Central to the exercise of government in this manner, we argue, are ‘climate change experiments’– purposive interventions in urban socio-technical systems designed to respond to the imperatives of mitigating and adapting to climate change in the city. Drawing on three different concepts – of governance experiments, socio-technical experiments, and strategic experiments – we first develop a framework for understanding the nature and dynamics of urban climate change experiments. We use this conceptual analysis to frame a scoping study of the global dimensions of urban climate change experimentation in a database of 627 urban climate change experiments in 100 global cities. The analysis charts when and where these experiments occur, the relationship between the social and technical aspects of experimentation and the governance of urban climate change experimentation, including the actors involved in their governing and the extent to which new political spaces for experimentation are emerging in the contemporary city. We find that experiments serve to create new forms of political space within the city, as public and private authority blur, and are primarily enacted through forms of technical intervention in infrastructure networks, drawing attention to the importance of such sites in urban climate politics. These findings point to an emerging research agenda on urban climate change experiments that needs to engage with the diversity of experimentation in different urban contexts, how they are conducted in practice and their impacts and implications for urban governance and urban life.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aedc7eaf7b3974e45aa94b02bf64de78beccc976,https://durham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/1476754/10434.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aedc7eaf7b3974e45aa94b02bf64de78beccc976,,"Sociology, Environmental Science, Political Science, Sociology",971,c512119c32106af77aa14613f871fd19,10.1111/J.1475-5661.2012.00535.X,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Sociology'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Political Science'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Sociology'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:57:19.170426+00:00,2025-10-22 22:57:19.170426+00:00

Metzen, Tim Genewein, Volker Fischer, Bastian Bischoff",2017,"Machine learning and deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years. However, it remains vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of the input that have been crafted specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible to a human. In this work, we propose to augment deep neural networks with a small ""detector"" subnetwork which is trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine data from data containing adversarial perturbations. Our method is orthogonal to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused on making the classification network itself more robust. We show empirically that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though they are quasi-imperceptible to humans. Moreover, while the detectors have been trained to detect only a specific adversary, they generalize to similar and weaker adversaries. In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools both the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the detector that counteracts this attack.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/061fef7e31c2b6ae59e49b8cf3dfb9c449aebc0a,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04267.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/061fef7e31c2b6ae59e49b8cf3dfb9c449aebc0a,International Conference on Learning Representations,"Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Science",967,ed6d334c995049244c0ff3e37af24bdd,,1702.04267,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Computer Science'}, {'source': 'external', 'category': 'Mathematics'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Computer Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00,2025-10-22 22:26:29.994902+00:00

The quasiparticle (QP) band structures with spin–orbit coupling are calculated in the G0W0 approximation, and comparison is made with different density functional theory descriptions. Pitfalls related to the convergence of GW calculations for two-dimensional (2D) materials are discussed together with possible solutions. The monolayer band edge positions relative to vacuum are used to estimate the band alignment at various heterostructure interfaces. The sensitivity of the band structures to the in-plane lattice constant is analyzed and rationalized in terms of the electronic structure. Finally, the q-dependent dielectric functions and effective electron and hole masses are obtained from the QP band structure and used as input to a 2D hydrogenic model to estimate exciton binding energies.

Promising findings suggest that FMT may play a role also in the management of other disorders associated with the alteration of gut microbiota. Although the health community is assessing FMT with renewed interest and patients are becoming more aware, there are technical and logistical issues in establishing such a non-standardised treatment into the clinical practice with safety and proper governance. In view of this, an evidence-based recommendation is needed to drive the practical implementation of FMT. In this European Consensus Conference, 28 experts from 10 countries collaborated, in separate working groups and through an evidence-based process, to provide statements on the following key issues: FMT indications; donor selection; preparation of faecal material; clinical management and faecal delivery and basic requirements for implementing an FMT centre. Statements developed by each working group were evaluated and voted by all members, first through an electronic Delphi process, and then in a plenary consensus conference. The recommendations were released according to best available evidence, in order to act as guidance for physicians who plan to implement FMT, aiming at supporting the broad availability of the procedure, discussing other issues relevant to FMT and promoting future clinical research in the area of gut microbiota manipulation. This consensus report strongly recommends the implementation of FMT centres for the treatment of C. difficile infection as well as traces the guidelines of technicality, regulatory, administrative and laboratory requirements.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b538185af365a80b933dec8551fc6f4e6ceeee99,https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/66/4/569.full.pdf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b538185af365a80b933dec8551fc6f4e6ceeee99,Gut,"Medicine, Medicine, Environmental Science",960,dc6e8f6397a25dddd7e29d736b7e7ada,10.1136/gutjnl-2016-313017,,"[{'source': 'external', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Medicine'}, {'source': 's2-fos-model', 'category': 'Environmental Science'}]",semantic_scholar,2025-10-22 22:57:19.170426+00:00,2025-10-22 22:57:19.170426+00:00

Kwiatkowska, Sen Wang, Min Wu",2016,"Deep neural networks have achieved impressive experimental results in image classification, but can surprisingly be unstable with respect to adversarial perturbations, that is, minimal changes to the input image that cause the network to misclassify it. With potential applications including perception modules and end-to-end controllers for self-driving cars, this raises concerns about their safety. We develop a novel automated verification framework for feed-forward multi-layer neural networks based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). We focus on safety of image classification decisions with respect to image manipulations, such as scratches or changes to camera angle or lighting conditions that would result in the same class being assigned by a human, and define safety for an individual decision in terms of invariance of the classification within a small neighbourhood of the original image. We enable exhaustive search of the region by employing discretisation, and propagate the analysis layer by layer. Our method works directly with the network code and, in contrast to existing methods, can guarantee that adversarial examples, if they exist, are found for the given region and family of manipulations. If found, adversarial examples can be shown to human testers and/or used to fine-tune the network. We implement the techniques using Z3 and evaluate them on state-of-the-art networks, including regularised and deep learning networks.

Most past defenses are best effort and have been shown to be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Recently a set of certified defenses have been introduced, which provide guarantees of robustness to norm-bounded attacks. However these defenses either do not scale to large datasets or are limited in the types of models they can support. This paper presents the first certified defense that both scales to large networks and datasets (such as Google’s Inception network for ImageNet) and applies broadly to arbitrary model types.
