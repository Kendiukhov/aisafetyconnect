# PROJECT SUMMARY: AI SAFETY PAPER EXTRACTION

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
Extract AI Safety papers from Semantic Scholar API, store them in PostgreSQL (Docker) and analyze the extracted data, optimizing the process to maximize unique papers without API key.

---

## PROJECT PHASES

### PHASE 1: INITIAL CONFIGURATION (1.5 hours)
- Created `requirements.txt` with dependencies
- Configured `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL
- Resolved port conflicts (5432→5433→6543)
- Database configuration with credentials

### PHASE 2: EXTRACTOR DEVELOPMENT (2 hours)
- Implemented:
  - Hierarchical taxonomy with intelligent queries
  - Temporal filter (year_from)
  - Top-100 citations export
  - UPSERT by paper_id, DOI, ArXiv
  - JSONB fields for s2FieldsOfStudy
  - Robust backoff with Retry-After
  - HTTP caching with requests-cache
  - Configurable CLI parameters
  - Database indices

### PHASE 3: FIRST EXECUTION AND PROBLEMS (1 hour)
- **Problem**: Only 88 papers extracted from 1,047 processed
- **Problem**: Unique constraint errors on empty DOI/ArXiv
- **Problem**: Aggressive rate limiting (429 errors)

### PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION (1.5 hours)

- Increased limits (2000 papers/day, 1000/session)
- More conservative rate limiting
- Optimized batch saving
- Partial unique constraints (WHERE NOT NULL)

### PHASE 5: BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS (1 hour)
- **Critical problem identification**:
  - Excessive deduplication (8.4% efficiency)
  - Aggressive rate limiting
  - Redundant queries
  - Problematic constraints

### PHASE 6: OPTIMIZED SOLUTION (2 hours)
- Created `semantic_scholar.py`
- In-memory anti-duplication
- Ultra conservative rate limiting (4s delay)
- Diverse queries without overlap
- Clean constraints
- Extended cache (48h)

## BOTTLENECKS IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

### 1. EXCESSIVE DEDUPLICATION (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: 1,047 papers processed → 88 unique (8.4% efficiency)
- **Cause**: Overlapping queries, same base term in all
- **Solution**: 
  ```python
  # In-memory anti-duplication
  self.processed_paper_ids: Set[str] = set()
  # Filter before processing
  if paper_id and paper_id not in self.processed_paper_ids:
      new_papers.append(paper)
  ```
- **Result**: 83.4% efficiency (10x improvement)

### 2. AGGRESSIVE RATE LIMITING (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Frequent 429 errors, exponential backoff
- **Cause**: 2.5s delay insufficient for Semantic Scholar
- **Solution**:
  ```python
  # Ultra conservative rate limiting
  self.MIN_DELAY = 4.0  # vs 2.5s previous
  wait_s = min(self.MAX_DELAY, self.BASE_DELAY * (3 ** attempt) + random.uniform(2, 5))
  ```
- **Result**: Only 2 rate limits vs multiple blocks

### 3. REDUNDANT QUERIES (HIGH)
- **Problem**: "Mechanistic Interpretability" in all queries
- **Cause**: Query generation with overlap
- **Solution**:
  ```python
  # Diverse queries by specific area
  for area_key, payload in mappings.items():
      area = quote(area_key.replace("_", " "))
      queries.append(area)  # One query per area
  ```
- **Result**: More specific queries and less overlap

### 4. PROBLEMATIC DB CONSTRAINTS (MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: Duplication errors due to empty fields
- **Cause**: Unique constraints on empty DOI/ArXiv
- **Solution**:
  ```sql
  -- Partial unique constraints
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_papers_doi_unique ON papers (doi) WHERE doi IS NOT NULL AND doi != '';
  -- Then completely removed
  DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_papers_doi_unique;
  ```
- **Result**: No duplication errors

## LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Early deduplication** is critical for efficiency
2. **Conservative rate limiting** avoids API blocks
3. **Diverse queries** reduce overlap
4. **DB constraints** must be carefully designed
5. **Rapid iteration** allows identifying and solving problems

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Important! Requesr API Key**
2. **Run complete extraction** with more queries (It was done on Tuesday, September 30th)
3. **Analyze papers by research area**
4. **Generate reports** of citations by author/venue
5. **Implement batch PDF download**
6. **Temporal trend analysis** in AI Safety
