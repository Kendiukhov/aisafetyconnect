      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Negative emissions technologies (NETs), especially bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and direct air capture and storage, have been invoked as necessary to achieve the aspirational 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement. However, currently their costs are estimated to be very high, NETs do not seem to offer co-benefits besides mitigating climate change and there are significant concerns regarding possible negative impacts of their large-scale implementation on sustainable development. Costs can vary significantly due to locational factors such as availability of biomass resources and geological storage capacity. It will be up to progressive industrialized countries to take first steps to mobilize the mitigation potential of NETs. In order to understand whether NETs can provide a significant contribution to mitigation, financial incentives are needed that allow implementing the most attractive NET activities at the global scale. We see the market mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement – colloquially called ‘Sustainable Development Mechanism’ – as a possible cornerstone of such a policy instrument. While initially NETs will not be competitive on the free market, the mechanism can facilitate bilateral financial transfers for NETs, where mitigation units accrue to the financier. We discuss the functions and design elements that an international policy instrument may need to fulfil to successfully mobilize NETs. This includes in particular robust quantification of removed carbon under international oversight and preventing social and environmental conflicts particularly on land and water use by NETs to ensure long-term acceptability. Key policy insights International policy instruments that mobilize negative emissions technologies are inexistent despite most mitigation pathways relying on large-scale NETs implementation later this century. Feasibility of NETs at large-scale is highly uncertain due to high expected costs and political economy challenges. Practical experience is necessary for better understanding feasibility. For cost-effective global deployment of NETs, a policy instrument would need to mobilize international financial flows and implement safeguards concerning sustainable development impacts. The sustainable development mechanism established in Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement could be a good basis for this if it includes a robust approach to evaluating sustainable development impacts building on the sustainable development goals."

      "abstract": "Adaptive governance can help earn social license Many governments have seen digital health technologies as a promising tool to address coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly digital contact tracing (DCT) apps such as Bluetooth-based exposure notification apps that trace proximity to other devices (1) and GPS-based apps that collect geolocation data. But deploying these systems is fraught with challenges, and most national DCT apps have not yet had the expected rate of uptake. This can be attributed to a number of uncertainties regarding general awareness of DCT apps, privacy risks, and the actual effectiveness of DCT, as well as public attitudes toward a potentially pervasive form of digital surveillance. DCT thus appears to face a typical social control dilemma. On one hand, pending widespread uptake, assessing DCT effectiveness is extremely difficult; on the other hand, until DCT effectiveness is proven, its widespread use at a population scale is hard to justify. Recognizing that technological uptake is an open-ended process reliant upon social learning and the piecemeal creation of public trust, we suggest that policy-makers set up mechanisms to test effectiveness, oversee the use of DCT apps, monitor public attitudes, and adapt technological design to socially perceived risks and expectations."

      "abstract": "Electronic waste (e-waste) contains toxic elements causing an important impact on environmental and human health. However, the presence of valuable metals, such as copper or gold, among others, make recycling a necessity for obtaining an alternative source of raw materials. Conventional metal recovery methods are environmentally unsound, prompting the exploration of greener alternatives like bioleaching, which utilizes the activity of microorganisms for a more sustainable recovery. However, the mechanisms involved in the process and the conditions to optimize the metabolic paths are still not completely known. Monitorization and automatization of the different stages composing the global process are crucial for advancing in the implementation of this novel technology at an industrial scale. For the first time, an open-source industrial IoT system is designed to enhance and regulate bioleaching by implementing real-time monitoring and control within the plant’s infrastructure. This system includes an Android app that displays real-time plant data from sensors and a robust server featuring a flexible application programming interface (API) for future applications. The app caters to specific needs such as remote sensor reading, actuator control, and real-time bioleaching alerts, ensuring secure access and proactive event management. By utilizing collected data, it minimizes downtime, equipment failures, and supply chain disruptions. The server maintains seamless communication with the plant controller, enabling efficient pump activation and sensor data transmission. A telegram bot demonstrates the API’s flexibility by forwarding plant alerts to users. During validation with concurrent remote user access, the application demonstrated its ability to prevent irreversible plant failures through an advanced alarm system. Ultimately, this IIoT system amplifies plant performance, safety, and efficiency by optimizing processes and decision-making capabilities. It emerges as a pivotal open-source tool, securing remote oversight and management of large-scale bioleaching plants, promising adaptability for future enhancements."

      "abstract": "In this paper, it was critically discussed the consequences of having a proper Internal Audit Function together with the good corporate governance mechanism in the business organizations. These consequences were included to safeguard the interest of the shareholders towards the business organization. Introduction The incidences of the corporate scandals and global financial crisis in recent years has brought forward the concept of corporate governance and received growing attention from the regulators and public. The large-scale corporate failures and major accounting scandals such as WorldCom and Enron have reduced public confidence on the reliability and independency of accounting and auditing profession as well as the reputation of the financial markets. The regulatory and professional bodies have response to these scenarios by introducing several act, regulations and new standards as to govern the actions taken by the respective professions and organizations. One of the focus that emphasized by the regulatory is to increase the demand and awareness for internal assurance on corporate governance processes, which includes risk management and internal control in each organizations or companies. This has been done by increasing disclosure requirements that is pertaining with corporate governance and well placed of internal audit function as an essential element of the corporate governance’s assurance. Moreover, an increase of awareness and courtesy on the function, roles and establishment of internal audit in a growing number of organizations have been experiential over recent years. A number of recent studies have stated the importance and significant of the internal audit function for regulatory reforms and its ability to add value concerning quality corporate governance, through its oversight role, its enhancements to the monitor and controlling environment and its potential to detect and mitigate fraud risk. In other word, internal audit function should be maintained to provide International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 12, Dec, 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 718 the management and audit committee with ongoing assessments of the company’s system of internal control and risk management processes. It is claimed that the firm is in healthier position when it is equipped with an effective and efficient internal audit function that add value to services (Ridley & D’ Silva, 2007). In addition, in contributing the improvement of governance, the internal audit activity’s objectives comprise ensuring effective management’s accountability and performance, promoting right ethics and values, administrating risk and control information, and shared information between the management, board, internal and external auditors. The management, board, internal and external auditors are four interrelated pillars in an organization’s governance process. To succeed, each pillar must be effective and must work together to support the organization’s objectives and strategies with ethics and integrity. Ineffectiveness of these pillars will lead to the failure of organization’s governance such as what happen to Enron where each pillars was not effective and both internal auditors and external auditors were from the same firm. The objectives of the study is (1) to provide understandings on the current roles and responsibilities of the internal audit function and the necessary factors perceived in order to ensure its effectiveness; (2) to identify a relationship between internal audit function and corporate governance; and (3) to discuss on the internal audit function’s contribution towards a high quality of corporate governance process. Corporate Governance Corporate governance is a broad concept that has been used by regulators, investors, accountants, and boards of directors. Levitt (1999) defined corporate governance as “the link between a company’s management, directors, and its financial reporting system. Besides, Monks and Minow (2001) defined corporate governance as the “relationship among various participants in determining the direction and performance of corporations”. Whereas, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) defined governance as “processes deal with the procedures utilized by the representatives of the organization’s stakeholders to provide oversight of risk and control processes administered by management. The monitoring of organizational risks and the assurance that controls adequately mitigate those risks both contribute directly to the achievement of organizational goals and the preservation of organizational value. Those performing governance activities are accountable to the organization’s stakeholders for effective stewardship”. More lately, Roe (2004) defines corporate governance as the relationships at the top of the firm (the board of directors, the senior managers, and the stockholders). Based on his opinion, the institutions of corporate governance are those recurrent mechanisms that assign authority among the three that that effect in controlling the decisions made at the top of the firm. In short, corporate governance shows an idea of objectives communication, incentives, control and monitoring (Staciokas & Rupsys, 2005). The development of corporate governance rules and guidelines is happened due to the increases in corporate fraud, high profile corporate failures, and unethical business practices that caused by the growing lack of trust in directors. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 12, Dec, 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 719 Internal Audit Function The internal audit function plays a unique role in the governance process. Internal audit is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization’s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes (Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), 2009). Management often requests internal auditors to help provide them with assurance that organizational processes are controlled effectively and efficiently and risks are identified and monitored effectively. The internal audit’s unique role makes it often depicted as the “eyes and ears of management”. Thus, internal auditors have to face conflict in assisting management to assess the effectiveness and efficiencies of their governance processes whereas reporting to the audit committee on the tone at the top. Figure 1 indicates substantial differences in functions and required skills in serving audit committee needs, as opposed in fulfilling the needs of management. Management requires the internal auditor to serve both assurance and consulting, addressing risks, evaluate the efficiency of operations, and stimulate organizational action. In contrast, the audit committee is more attentive in assurance concerning controls. The internal audit function has advanced in many organizations to a leadership position in facilitating the organization in implementing, assessing, or conceptualizing risk management and control processes within an organization. In other words, internal audit has performed an active role in executing effective corporate governance and in assessing effective management’s control practices. Through the provision of effective support to the management, internal audit constitutes an important element of the company’s internal corporate governance (Freidank & Pasternack, 2011; Sarens & Abdolmohammadi, 2011). In this respect, if a quality assessment of internal audit activities can be made; internal audit function might be viewed as an intangible asset for an organization. Figure 1: Competing Demands on Internal Audit Function (Sources: Hermanson & Rittenberg, 2003) International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 12, Dec, 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 720 Internal Audit Function and Corporate Governance In the past 50 years, organizations in the private, public service and voluntary sectors have recognized internal auditing functions to provide assurance and improve their monitoring activities. At this time, most internal audit work pertained to internal accounting control and assets’ security. Shortly after 1942, IIA were established worldwide to promote professionalism for internal auditing. The main aim at the time was to encourage internal auditors worldwide to meet and share their experiences in auditing. During this time, Mints (1972) stated that internal auditing relationships classified into three broad groups, which is traditional (protection, compliance), current moderate approach (constructive and protective, problem-solving) and participative teamwork approach (providing assistance in achieving organization objectives, working with management). Later, many research continues to form the internal auditors’ behavior in the services they deliver and the professional guidance provided by the IIA. Whereas, the governance developments started since Cadbury (1992) and supported both the significance of evaluating the controls’ effectiveness and the significance of reviewing the requirement for internal auditing in a company. Then, there is existence of legal requirements for internal auditing for some time but these requirements are only focused on compliance and safeguarding of assets, and not for the services relating assurance and advice on risk management, control and governance issues. By 1999, the IIA with affiliated chapters and national institutes in many countries had developed into a global organization. IIA has revised its internal auditing’s definition, re-emphasizing its important roles in risk management, control and for the first time it mentioned its roles in governance processes.

      "abstract": "The current in vitro diagnostic design process is a combination of methods from engineering disciplines and from government regulatory agencies. The goal of design processes that have been developed is to ensure that a new product meets the user’s expectations and is safe and effective in providing its claimed benefits and proper functioning, otherwise known as the essential design outputs. In order to improve the ability of designers and auditors to ascertain the safety and efficacy of a product, the use of design controls has been adopted that specify a method of evaluating the design process at several key stages. The main objective of this research was to examine the resolution and architectural details necessary to build an adequate manufacturing control system to assure the EDO outputs in large IVD instruments in the company under study. The control system is the defined inspections and test processes to delineate between acceptable and unacceptable product before release for sale. The authors reviewed current design control regulatory requirements within the IVD industry, as well as design controls in other regulated industries. This research was completed to determine what opportunities could be transferred to large in-vitro IVD instruments using an IVD manufacturer as a case study. In conclusion, the research identified three areas where a properly configured EDO can add value within IVD instrument design and manufacture, namely: (1) development of a control system which is fit for purpose; (2) a mechanism to manage and proliferate key design knowledge within the organisation and thereby manage outsourced services; and (3) implementing a scaled engineering change process because changes impacting EDO naturally require extra regulatory and engineering oversight."

      "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly interact, collaborate, and delegate tasks to one another autonomously with minimal human interaction. Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management. To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a scalable Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents'lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agent contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, providing formal security guarantees. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments."

      "abstract": "Abstract The motivation of this research is the surge in the integration of the digital economy (DE) and fiscal decentralization (FD) as crucial issues for countries. To maintain sustainable growth, it is important for EU to adopt sustainable development goal (SDGs) practices. However, the connection between DE, FD, and SDG practices has not been thoroughly examined in existing literature. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the mediating role of DE between FD and SDGs in EU. We employed a panel dataset between 2016 and 2022 from Eurostat, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and Government Finance Statistics, using a quantitative research design, and applied the structural equation model (PLS-SEM) analysis to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that FD has a significant negative effect on economic sustainability but a significant positive effect on environmental and social SDGs. In addition, FD has a significant positive effect on DE. We also found that DE has a significant positive relationship with economic and social SDGs. However, DE has a negative but significant influence on environmental sustainability. This study also proved that DE plays a mediating role between FD and Sustainability. This study contributes to theories of fiscal federalism and resource dependency. These original findings have several practical implications for policymakers and contribute to the current debate on the role of FD in SDGs through DE. hence, we recommend that policymakers prioritize the development of broadband Internet access, e-governance resources, and invest in digital skill training programs. Impact statement This study examines the mediating role of digital economy between fiscal decentralization and sustainable development goals in the European union. The results indicate that fiscal decentralization has a significant negative effect on economic sustainability. Digital economy has a negative but significant influence on environmental sustainability. This study also highlights that digital economy plays a mediating role between fiscal decentralization and Sustainability. This highlights the importance of digitalization for sustainability dimensions. These robust results support efforts towards a move for a digital economy to foster sustainable growth. Utilizing a panel dataset between 2016 and 2022 from Eurostat, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and Government Finance Statistics, using a quantitative research design, and applied the structural equation model analysis to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that fiscal decentralization has a significant negative effect on economic sustainability but a significant positive effect on environmental and social sustainable development goals. In addition, fiscal decentralization has a significant positive effect on digital economy. We also found that digital economy has a significant positive relationship with economic and social sustainable development goals. However, digital economy has a negative but significant influence on environmental sustainability. The findings of this research have valuable practical implications for policymakers and guide governments in defining more interesting strategies to manage fiscal decentralization in a wise manner to successfully achieve the objectives of the sustainable development goals through the proper implementation of digital economy on a large scale among societies. It is important for policymakers to strike a balance in fiscal decentralization ensuring efficient revenue allocation mechanisms and enhancing fiscal responsibilities, ensuring that local governments have sufficient autonomy to address local needs while maintaining effective oversight and coordination. Consistent with our results on digital economy and sustainable development goals, governments should prioritize the development of broadband Internet access, e-governance resources, and other digital technologies. Investing in digital skills training programs will ensure that citizens and businesses can take advantage of the opportunities presented by digital economy. The study highlights further research could investigate this model in developing economies to enable comparison. Ultimately, the study paves the way for a more digital and sustainable drive by providing evidence and direction for future initiatives."

      "abstract": "Auroral image classification has long been a focus of research in auroral physics. However, current methods for automatic auroral classification typically assume that only one type of aurora is present in an auroral image. This oversight neglects the complex transition states and coexistence of multiple types during the auroral evolution process, thus limiting the exploration of the intricate semantics of auroral images. To fully exploit the physical information embedded in auroral images, this paper proposes a multi-label auroral classification method, termed MLAC, which integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer architectures. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale feature fusion framework that enables the model to capture both fine-grained features and high-level information in auroral images, resulting in a more comprehensive representation of auroral features. Secondly, we propose a lightweight multi-head self-attention mechanism that captures long-range dependencies between pixels during the multiscale feature fusion process, which is crucial for distinguishing subtle differences between auroral types. Furthermore, we design a residual focused multilayer perceptron module that integrates large kernel depth-wise convolution with an improved multilayer perceptron. This integration enhances the model’s ability to represent complex spatial structure, thus improving local feature extraction and global contextual understanding. The proposed method achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 88.20% on the auroral observation data collected at the Yellow River Station from 2003 to 2008. This performance significantly surpasses that of the most advanced multi-label classification models while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Moreover, our method also outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label methods in both computational efficiency and classification accuracy on two publicly available multi-label image datasets: WIDER-Attribute and VOC2007. These results demonstrate that our method skillfully leverages the robust feature extraction capability of CNNs for local features and the superior global information processing capability of Transformer."

      "abstract": "The research introduces a revolutionary Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for fish farming, designed to significantly enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. By integrating the NodeMcu12E ESP8266 microcontroller, this system automates the management of critical water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, and oxygen levels, essential for fostering optimal fish growth conditions and minimizing mortality rates. The core of this innovation lies in its intelligent monitoring and control mechanism, which not only supports accelerated fish development but also ensures the robustness of the farming process through automated adjustments whenever the monitored parameters deviate from desired thresholds. This smart fish farming solution features an Arduino IoT cloud-based framework, offering a user-friendly web interface that enables fish farmers to remotely monitor and manage their operations from any global location. This aspect of the system emphasizes the importance of efficient information management and the transformation of sensor data into actionable insights, thereby reducing the need for constant human oversight and significantly increasing operational reliability. The autonomous functionality of the system is a key highlight, designed to persist in adjusting the environmental conditions within the fish farm until the optimal parameters are restored. This capability greatly diminishes the risks associated with manual monitoring and adjustments, allowing even those with limited expertise in aquaculture to achieve high levels of production efficiency and sustainability. By leveraging data-driven technologies and IoT innovations, this study not only addresses the immediate needs of the fish farming industry but also contributes to solving the broader global challenge of protein production. It presents a scalable and accessible approach to modern aquaculture, empowering stakeholders to maximize output and minimize risks associated with fish farming, thereby paving the way for a more sustainable and efficient future in the global food supply."

      "abstract": "We examine the causal effect of reduced disclosure levels on the risk of default. Employing regression discontinuity (RD) design as our main identification strategy and the smaller reporting company rule (SRC rule) as the exogenous source of variation, we show that smaller reporting companies (SRCs), which are permitted to provide scaled disclosures in their 10-Ks, experience significantly and economically higher default risk. We demonstrate that, while there is no effect of information loss if a smaller reporting company voluntarily maintains its disclosure level by continuing to report its financial performance in full, there is an increase in its default risk due to the loss of commitment to mandatory disclosure. We also find that, compared to previously qualified SRCs, newly qualified smaller reporting companies face steeper increases in bankruptcy risk during their first year of eligibility. Our analysis indicates that strong external oversight mechanisms, better corporate governance, and credible audit quality attenuate the negative impact of reduced disclosure levels on the risk of default. Our results are robust to alternative model specifications, RD design assumptions, and measures of default risk."

      "abstract": "According to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), until 3 July 2022, Africa has had 11.8 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confirmed cases and 254 179 COVID-19 deaths. However, while three quarters of COVID-19 vaccine doses supplied had been used, only less than a quarter of the African population has been fully vaccinated. New pandemic waves driven by the regular emergence of new variants complicates the situation. The African Union has a population of 1.2 billion and 55 Member States, but imports almost all of its vaccines and consumes one quarter of the global vaccine supply.1 Apart from yellow fever vaccine production by the Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal, no other World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified vaccine manufacturer exists in Africa. Although a few fill and finish pharmaceutical companies just fill the vaccine obtained from other manufacturers into vials, label and package,1,2 no capacity for active ingredient manufacture and even for fill and finish is available. The existing capacity falls short of guaranteeing self-sufficiency, especially in the current dynamic pandemic situation. Handling of the current and previous pandemics such as the 2009–2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak should teach us how to better prepare for future pandemics.3 In search of how investment for vaccine production in Africa could be triggered, a study was published before the COVID-19 outbreak on how Africa’s local production could fit well in a broad business model that would ensure sustainable new vaccine introduction.4 Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a wake-up call for most African countries and the pan-African or regional communities to venture into vaccine production. Several vaccine production scenarios have been widely discussed in Africa, through either the Africa CDC or other stakeholders such as the African Union Development Agency-New Partnership for Africa’s Development. At least six countries have declared an interest in pursuing the vaccine production pathway, including some by fill and finish or distribution only and others through training their personnel. Several of these declarations were triggered by the intent of vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer/ BioNTech and Moderna to invest in Africa. However, the decision in most of these countries has been based on either a single country-restricted approach or a political move for public support. Importantly, the long-term success of these decisions may not be sustainable due to a potential difficulty in achieving a return on investment. Uncoordinated technology transfer to a single country and establishment of vaccine manufacturing approaches will likely not favour sustainable manufacturing capacitybuilding in Africa, leading countries to compete in the same vaccine market. Thus, uncoordinated vaccine production initiatives driven by national (singlecountry) approaches may reduce the sustainability of a business model and jeopardize market access. Despite delays in vaccination, the COVID-19 death toll measured in Africa has been lower than in other continents.5 WHO foresees that COVID-19 related deaths in Africa may fall by over three quarters in 2022 thanks to vaccination, other nonpharmaceutical control measures and natural immunity.6 Therefore, a shift in political focus to other ongoing or emerging crises such as the rise in the cost of living may affect the pandemic-induced political commitment and previously declared priorities to establish local COVID-19 vaccine production. Unless countries in pursuit of local vaccine production intend to widen the scope beyond the current pandemic in a coordinated approach to produce other vaccines in addition to COVID-19 vaccines, most national vaccine production facilities will not succeed because of the high maintenance cost. For a business model to be sustained, economies of scale have to be attained and maintained; a market based on a single country has less likelihood to guarantee this. Thus, a regional approach could bring these efforts to sustainable success. In the event that countries succeed in establishing their own vaccine production facilities, they should at least agree to specialize or share production and procurement of critical materials such as active product ingredients and technology know-how. Cooperation with other countries in the same economic zone would be a good start. If the African Medicines Agency Member States or the countries of any regional economic zone agreed on a vision to enable sustainable local vaccine manufacture and respective regulatory oversight, advanced marketing commitments – that is, purchasing agreements – for the locally produced vaccines could provide planning security for the collaborating countries’ vaccination programmes and the manufacturers’ business plans. During the African Union Development Agency-New Partnership for Africa’s Development COVID-19 related webinar series7 in 2020, the African Development Bank designed a financing mechanism with financing local manufacturers as the bank’s priority. The funding of the facility could thus be ensured by the investor (whether private or public) for example in collaboration with the African Development Bank, local government contributions and international grants.

      "abstract": "Grasping robots always confront challenges such as uncertainties in object size, orientation, and type, necessitating effective feature augmentation to improve grasping detection performance. However, many prior studies inadequately emphasize grasp-related features, resulting in suboptimal grasping performance. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new grasping approach termed the Feature-Augmented Grasp Detection Network (FAGD-Net). The proposed network incorporates two modules designed to enhance spatial information features and multi-scale features. Firstly, we introduce the Residual Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (Res-EMA) module, which effectively adjusts the importance of feature channels while preserving precise spatial information within those channels. Additionally, we present a Feature Fusion Pyramidal Module (FFPM) that serves as an intermediary between the encoder and decoder, effectively addressing potential oversights or losses of grasp-related features as the encoder network deepens. As a result, FAGD-Net achieved advanced levels of grasping accuracy, with 98.9% and 96.5% on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets, respectively. The grasp detection model was deployed on a physical robot for real-world grasping experiments, where we conducted a series of trials in diverse scenarios. In these experiments, we randomly selected various unknown household items and adversarial objects. Remarkably, we achieved high success rates, with a 95.0% success rate for single-object household items, 93.3% for multi-object scenarios, and 91.0% for cluttered scenes."

      "abstract": "Cancer remains a formidable global health challenge due to its complex pathophysiology and resistance to conventional treatments. In recent years, the convergence of nanotechnology and oncology has paved the way for innovative therapeutic platforms that address the limitations of traditional modalities. This review examines how nanoparticle (NP)-based strategies enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, immunotherapy, and gene therapy by enabling targeted delivery, controlled drug release, and tumor-specific accumulation via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. We discuss the design and functionalization of various organic, inorganic, and hybrid NPs, highlighting their roles in improving pharmacokinetics, overcoming multidrug resistance, and modulating the tumor microenvironment. Particular emphasis is placed on dual and multimodal therapies, such as chemo-phototherapy, chemo-immunotherapy, and gene-radiotherapy, that leverage nanoparticle carriers to amplify synergistic effects, minimize systemic toxicity, and improve clinical outcomes. We also explore cutting-edge advances in gene editing and personalized nanomedicine, as well as emerging strategies to address biological barriers and immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor niche. Despite the undeniable promise of nanoparticle-based cancer therapies, challenges related to toxicity, scalable manufacturing, regulatory oversight, and long-term biocompatibility must be overcome before they can fully enter clinical practice. By synthesizing recent findings and identifying key opportunities for innovation, this review provides insight into how nanoscale platforms are propelling the next generation of precision oncology."

      "abstract": "As AI capabilities rapidly advance, the risk of catastrophic harm from large-scale training runs is growing. Yet the compute infrastructure that enables such development remains largely unregulated. This paper proposes a concrete framework for a global\"Compute Pause Button\": a governance system designed to prevent dangerously powerful AI systems from being trained by restricting access to computational resources. We identify three key intervention points -- technical, traceability, and regulatory -- and organize them within a Governance--Enforcement--Verification (GEV) framework to ensure rules are clear, violations are detectable, and compliance is independently verifiable. Technical mechanisms include tamper-proof FLOP caps, model locking, and offline licensing. Traceability tools track chips, components, and users across the compute supply chain. Regulatory mechanisms establish constraints through export controls, production caps, and licensing schemes. Unlike post-deployment oversight, this approach targets the material foundations of advanced AI development. Drawing from analogues ranging from nuclear non-proliferation to pandemic-era vaccine coordination, we demonstrate how compute can serve as a practical lever for global cooperation. While technical and political challenges remain, we argue that credible mechanisms already exist, and that the time to build this architecture is now, before the window for effective intervention closes."

      "abstract": "Public decision-makers have always tried to anticipate future events to handle efficiently new regulatory challenges. In recent years, however, public administrations have engaged more structurally and systematically with strategic foresight. The scale, haste and complexity of issues to be regulated, on the one hand, and the necessity for public sector institutions to adopt inclusive, innovative and adaptive methods in the exercise of regulatory powers, on the other, have contributed to the growing relevance of horizon-scanning and future-thinking into the public sector. \n \nThis paper sets out by analysing how strategic thinking and oversight have expanded at the public sector level. It firstly provides an overview of European governments. The approaches of European policy-makers vary both in terms of substance and administrative structures dedicated to foresight. Depending on the case, they may opt for centralised or decentralised foresight bodies or they can rely more or less frequently on external expertise. The same applies to non-EU countries’ approaches to future-thinking, to which this briefing dedicates a cursory analysis. \n \nSupranational regulators, and specifically the European Union, make no exception in this regard. Foresight activities at the Union level are carried out through dedicated structures and developed through collaboration with strategic policy advice mechanisms. The new European Commission has committed to strengthen strategic foresight in EU policy-making in order to help EU institutions to better design laws, as well as developing future-oriented policies. The plan includes the set-up of a EU Network of Strategic Foresight, bringing together the best of EU institutions and the member states, as well as the preparation of a yearly Foresight Report on the most relevant emerging trends. \n \nThe analysis of strategic foresight by national and Union institutions shows that foresight activities and civic engagement are dependent on each other. Supported by technology, policy-makers can crowdsource the 'civic surplus' (ideas and skills) held by individuals and communities, thus providing smarter solutions to future regulatory challenges. The conclusive remarks of the briefing stress this aspect, by pointing at the relevance of collective intelligence in foresight studies."

      "abstract": "The prompt acquisition of precise land cover categorization data is indispensable for the strategic development of contemporary farming practices, especially within the realm of forestry oversight and preservation. Forests are complex ecosystems that require precise monitoring to assess their health, biodiversity, and response to environmental changes. The existing methods for classifying remotely sensed imagery often encounter challenges due to the intricate spacing of feature classes, intraclass diversity, and interclass similarity, which can lead to weak perceptual ability, insufficient feature expression, and a lack of distinction when classifying forested areas at various scales. In this study, we introduce the DASR-Net algorithm, which integrates a dual attention network (DAN) in parallel with the Residual Network (ResNet) to enhance land cover classification, specifically focusing on improving the classification of forested regions. The dual attention mechanism within DASR-Net is designed to address the complexities inherent in forested landscapes by effectively capturing multiscale semantic information. This is achieved through multiscale null attention, which allows for the detailed examination of forest structures across different scales, and channel attention, which assigns weights to each channel to enhance feature expression using an improved BSE-ResNet bilinear approach. The two-channel parallel architecture of DASR-Net is particularly adept at resolving structural differences within forested areas, thereby avoiding information loss and the excessive fusion of features that can occur with traditional methods. This results in a more discriminative classification of remote sensing imagery, which is essential for accurate forest monitoring and management. To assess the efficacy of DASR-Net, we carried out tests with 10m Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing images over the Heshan District, which is renowned for its varied forestry. The findings reveal that the DASR-Net algorithm attains an accuracy rate of 96.36%, outperforming classical neural network models and the transformer (ViT) model. This demonstrates the scientific robustness and promise of the DASR-Net model in assisting with automatic object recognition for precise forest classification. Furthermore, we emphasize the relevance of our proposed model to hyperspectral datasets, which are frequently utilized in agricultural and forest classification tasks. DASR-Net’s enhanced feature extraction and classification capabilities are particularly advantageous for hyperspectral data, where the rich spectral information can be effectively harnessed to differentiate between various forest types and conditions. By doing so, DASR-Net contributes to advancing remote sensing applications in forest monitoring, supporting sustainable forestry practices and environmental conservation efforts. The findings of this study have significant practical implications for urban forestry management. The DASR-Net algorithm can enhance the accuracy of forest cover classification, aiding urban planners in better understanding and monitoring the status of urban forests. This, in turn, facilitates the development of effective forest conservation and restoration strategies, promoting the sustainable development of the urban ecological environment."

      "abstract": "The progression towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) presents unprecedented opportunities and risks, necessitating robust, adaptable oversight mechanisms. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approaches with blockchain technology for AGI governance. Our system employs smart contracts to dynamically trigger human oversight based on multi-faceted criteria, including decision confidence, novelty detection, and ethical considerations. It creates an immutable, transparent audit trail of AGI decisions and human interventions, crucial for accountability and continuous improvement. The framework implements a decentralized governance model with token-based incentives, ensuring diverse expert participation and aligning stakeholder interests with responsible AGI development. This approach addresses key challenges in AGI oversight: scalability, transparency, rapid response to emerging behaviors, and adaptive ethical alignment. It offers fine-grained control over AGI systems while allowing for their continued development. The blockchain foundation ensures tamper-resistant record-keeping and enables global coordination with local adaptation, critical for managing AGI in diverse environments. Our solution is designed to evolve alongside AGI capabilities, incorporating machine learning to predict necessary oversight adaptations. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining effective oversight as AGI systems potentially approach and surpass human-level intelligence. By bridging computer science, ethics, governance, and economics, our framework provides a comprehensive approach to responsible AGI development. It has far-reaching implications for various sectors and offers policymakers a concrete tool for implementing AGI regulations. This work represents a significant step towards ensuring that AGI's transformative potential can be realized while mitigating risks, potentially reshaping Human-AGI coexistence."

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly powers public-facing digital services, ensuring its integration is guided by ethical, transparent, and accountable frameworks has become critical. This study proposes a conceptual model for responsible AI integration in the design, delivery, and governance of digital platforms within the public sector. The model is informed by a systematic synthesis of academic literature, government reports, and real-world case studies spanning healthcare, digital identity systems, e-governance platforms, and intelligent public services from 2015 to 2024. The review highlights that while AI offers transformative benefits such as automation, personalization, and predictive analytics it also introduces risks including algorithmic bias, opacity, surveillance concerns, and inequitable access. The proposed model comprises five interlocking components: stakeholder-centered design, algorithmic transparency, regulatory compliance, human oversight, and adaptive feedback loops. These components are aligned with international principles such as fairness, explainability, accountability, and human-centric innovation. At the heart of the model is the integration of Responsible AI practices into platform governance mechanisms, ensuring that public trust, user agency, and digital equity are preserved. The model advocates for inclusive stakeholder engagement at every stage from needs assessment to deployment and monitoring alongside policy instruments that support continuous evaluation and redress mechanisms. Furthermore, it emphasizes cross-sector collaboration between technologists, policymakers, ethicists, and civil society organizations to ensure multidimensional accountability. Case insights from AI-powered welfare systems, smart city initiatives, and intelligent public health platforms demonstrate both the potential and pitfalls of AI when ethical considerations are not systematically embedded. The model offers a flexible blueprint adaptable to various scales of governance and institutional capacities, providing a pathway to bridge technological advancement with democratic values. This conceptual model contributes to the growing discourse on digital trust and responsible innovation, serving as a strategic tool for governments, platform designers, and regulators seeking to deploy AI technologies in ways that enhance service delivery while safeguarding public interest."

      "abstract": "Vendor performance evaluation is a strategic element in retail supply chains, ensuring that suppliers deliver consistent value in terms of cost, quality, delivery, and compliance. This study explores how data-driven evaluation systems, contract management practices, and performance enforcement mechanisms collectively enhance supply chain efficiency and resilience. A quantitative, explanatory research design was adopted, with data collected through a structured questionnaire distributed to procurement managers, supply chain executives, and contract administrators. Purposive sampling ensured that respondents were directly involved in vendor oversight, while secondary data such as procurement reports and vendor scorecards were used to triangulate findings. Responses measured on a five-point Likert scale captured operational metrics, financial sustainability, and compliance adherence, along with the role of digital contract management systems in monitoring obligations, penalties, and incentives. Data analysis combined descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test hypothesized relationships between evaluation metrics, contract enforcement, and retail performance outcomes. Results indicate that operational metrics, particularly on-time delivery and quality conformance, remain central, but financial measures such as cost-to-serve and invoice accuracy, alongside compliance metrics, increasingly shape contractual decisions. Digital platforms were shown to transform contract management by enhancing transparency, reducing risks, and linking performance evaluation directly with enforceable actions. Performance-based contracting further aligned supplier incentives with retailer objectives, fostering accountability and continuous improvement. Overall, the findings highlight that vendor performance evaluation is no longer a static measurement process but a dynamic, data-driven framework that integrates analytics, scorecards, and contract enforcement to strengthen decision-making, supplier collaboration, and long-term competitiveness in the retail sector."

      "abstract": "Community Health Committees (CHCs) are mechanisms through which communities participate in the governance and oversight of community health services. While there is renewed interest in strengthening community participation in the governance of community health services, there is limited evidence on how context influences community-level structures of governance and oversight. The objective of this study was to examine how contextual factors influence the functionality of CHCs in Kajiado, Migori, and Nairobi Counties in Kenya. Using a case study design, we explored the influence of context on CHCs using 18 focus group discussions with 110 community members (clients, CHC members, and community health volunteers [CHVs]) and interviews with 33 health professionals. Essential CHC functions such as 'leadership' and 'management' were weak, partly because Health professionals did not involve CHCs in developing health plans. Community Health Committees were active in the supervision of CHVs, reviewing their household reports, although they did not utilise these data for making decisions. Resource mobilisation and evaluation of health programs were affected by the lack of administrative and operational support, such as training. Despite having influential membership, CHCs could not provide leadership and management functions. Health system actors perceived the roles of CHCs as service providers rather than structures for governance and oversight. Insufficient awareness of CHC roles among health professionals, lack of training and operational support for community-based activities constrained CHCs' functionality and thus their role in community participation. While there are efforts to institutionalise community-level governance structures for health at sub-national level, there is a need to scale-up these efforts countrywide. We recommend that community-level governance structures be empowered, mandated, and provided with resources to take on the responsibility of overseeing community health services and exacting accountability from health providers."

      "abstract": "We propose that hierarchical organizations can engender and sustain the collaboration of large numbers of autonomous actors by establishing self-managed, mission-aligned collectives. Informing our claim are preliminary findings from an ongoing study of the housing movement in São Paulo, Brazil. Unexpectedly, we find that hierarchical Social Movement Organizations (SMOs) have, for more than three decades, incentivized broad-based voluntary engagement in protest actions aimed at formulating new housing policy by educating and encouraging low-income families to join collectives tasked with developing and self-managing new housing projects. We trace the sustainability of this participation architecture to an SMO-designed, points-based system, which functions as an integrating mechanism affording: (1) goal alignment between large numbers of autonomous actors and the leadership of a hierarchical organization; (2) voluntary engagement by autonomous actors in activities that simultaneously address local and higher order goals; (3) role and task allocation without legal control or close oversight; and (4) retention within the participation architecture by equipping autonomous actors with structure and measurable progress towards local goals and fairly distributing benefits of collective work. We discuss implications to our understanding of how to achieve concerted action at scale towards a grand challenge."

      "abstract": "Objective To compare the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of scapular dyskinesis-based exercise therapy (SDBET) and multimodal physical therapy (MPT) in young male overhead athletes with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) and scapular dyskinesis (SD). Methods This single-center, single-blind, parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial was designed to compare two interventions in athletes clinically diagnosed with SIS and SD. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Sample size was determined a priori using G*Power (f = 0.25, α = 0.05, power = 0.80), yielding a required sample of 28; 32 participants were planned to account for potential dropout. Inclusion criteria were: male overhead athletes aged 18–25 years with clinically diagnosed SIS and SD. Exclusion criteria included prior surgery or other contraindications. Participants were randomized to either SDBET or MPT groups. Both groups received 8 weeks of intervention (3 sessions/week) and a 4-week follow-up. The primary variable was disability, measured using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). The secondary variables were pain (measured using the Visual Analog Scale [VAS]), shoulder active range of motion (AROM, measured using goniometry), strength (measured using Isometric Strength Tests [IST] of scapular stabilizers and external rotators), and scapular kinematics (measured using the Scapular Dyskinesis Test [SDT]). Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 8, and week 12. Result A total of 32 participants were analyzed (SDBET group: n = 16; MPT group: n = 16). Mixed-design ANOVA revealed significant main effects of time for all outcomes (all p < 0.001, η² = 0.71–0.92), and significant group effects for SPADI and IST (p < 0.01). Significant Time × Group interactions were also observed for all variables (p < 0.05, η² = 0.15–0.76), prompting further simple effects analysis. Disability (SPADI) decreased significantly in both groups by week 8 (p < 0.001, η² = 0.03), with no between-group difference. However, only the SDBET group maintained improvements at week 12 (p < 0.001, η² = 0.59). Pain (VAS) decreased more in the MPT group at week 8 (p = 0.018, η² = 0.17), but rebounded by week 12, eliminating group differences (p = 0.268, η² = 0.04). Active range of motion (AROM) improved in both groups by week 8 (p < 0.001), with only the SDBET group sustaining these gains at week 12 (p < 0.001, η² = 0.37). Strength (IST of scapular stabilizers and external rotators) improved exclusively in the SDBET group at both week 8 and 12 (all p < 0.001), with significant between-group differences (η² = 0.57–0.74). Scapular kinematics (SDT) improved in 43.8% of SDBET participants, while no change was observed in the MPT group (p = 0.001–0.004). Conclusion Both SDBET and MPT improved shoulder disability, pain and AROM in SIS patients with SD, but only SDBET showed lasting effects. Targeted therapy has more comprehensive and sustained effects. Trial registration This study was retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 03/04/2025 (Registration Number: ChiCTR2500100213), after the completion of participant enrolment due to administrative oversight. Although registration occurred post-enrolment, the study protocol was finalized and ethically approved prior to participant recruitment. The authors acknowledge the importance of prospective trial registration and are committed to adhering to this standard in all future trials.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background The Covid-19 pandemic brought into sharp relief the role that long-term care facilities play in health and social care of an aging population. It also cast a spotlight upon the need for high-quality research to assess the effectiveness of any care home interventions. The Prophylactic Therapies in Care Homes (PROTECT-CH) trial was one such study (funded by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research). PROTECT-CH was designed to collect data in 200 care homes (approximately 6,400 residents), and whilst the changing epidemiology of Covid-19 in the UK (due to vaccination take-up) made this unfeasible other insights were gained about establishing large-scale research in care homes. Methods An iterative process evaluation of the set-up phase of a large, platform trial testing prophylactic measures in long-term care facilities. Including a documentary review of the PROTECT-CH working groups and an online survey of working group members. Results Documents were reviewed from 24 working groups, which in a hub and spoke model represented the PROTECT-CH trial infrastructure; representative of 20 of these groups completed an online survey about their organisation and working. Data demonstrated the number and organisation of individuals required to set up a large-scale care-home trial - 91 individuals representing a mix of academic, clinical, and methodological contributions from 25 organisations. Data demonstrated working groups specific to care home research, and activities designed to address the specific challenges of researching in care homes. PROTECT-CH produced dedicated training materials and reporting templates for care home research. PROTECT-CH established novel mechanisms for prescribing and clinical oversight in care home research. Conclusions PROTECT-CH has highlighted the complexity of establishing large, scale RCT research in long-term care facilities. It has produced resources which might be of use in subsequent care home research. Key messages • Infrastructure is required to support high quality research in long-term care facilities. • RCTs in long-term care facilities pose specific challenged to researchers."

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence methods offer objectivity and convenience in automatic depression detection, however, current research often neglects the critical role of facial landmarks. This oversight results in insufficient spatial structure information and a lack of detailed local representation, which fails to capture the nuanced semantic information crucial for identifying depression-related clues. To address these issues, we introduce a novel dual-branch network model comprising the Landmark-Image-Landmark Net (LIL Net) and the Global Context Vision Transformer Net (GCVit Net). Through a dual-stream, multiscale, and cross-fusion strategy, LIL Net is designed to extract original facial image features alongside landmark features, prioritizing the detailed semantic information of potential depression clues. LIL Net employs an innovative LIL Attention approach to jointly learn multiscale features from facial landmarks and images, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to capture fine-grained depression-related cues. Furthermore, the Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module fuses the obtained multiscale features, augmenting the semantic expression of potential depression clues within facial landmarks via attention mechanisms. Meanwhile, the GCVit Net branch network supplements global information by extracting global facial features. Finally, the features from both branches are concatenated to enhance the accuracy of depression degree predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model has superior performance in detecting depression compared to existing methods. We release our code at https://github.com/xlx777/LIL-Net."

      "abstract": "The convergence of decentralized artificial intelligence (DAI), blockchain technology, and smart contracts is reshaping the design and governance of intelligent systems. As these technologies rapidly evolve, addressing privacy within their architecture, usage models, and associated risks has become increasingly critical. This systematic literature review examines architectural patterns, governance frameworks, real-world applications, and persistent challenges in DAI systems. It identifies prevailing designs such as federated learning integrated with consensus protocols, smart contract-based incentive mechanisms, and decentralized verification methods. Drawing from a diverse body of recent literature, the review highlights implementations across sectors, including healthcare, finance, IoT, autonomous systems, and intelligent infrastructure, each demonstrating significant contributions to privacy, security, and collaborative innovation. Despite these advancements, DAI systems face ongoing obstacles such as scalability limitations, privacy trade-offs, and difficulties with regulatory compliance. The review emphasizes the need for integrative governance approaches that balance transparency, accountability, incentive alignment, and ethical oversight. These elements are proposed as co-evolving pillars essential to establishing trustworthiness in decentralized AI ecosystems. This work offers a comprehensive review for understanding the current landscape and guiding the development of responsible and effective DAI systems in the Web3 era."

      "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of cross-jurisdictional sharing across the 61 local public health jurisdictions (LHJs) in Kentucky. The opportunities to reduce the cost-of-service delivery for Kentucky's LHJs via cross-jurisdictional sharing present a mechanism to address financial instability across the state by achieving economies of scale, especially among smaller jurisdictions. Design: A cross-sectional study design was used to examine patterns of cross-jurisdictional sharing across the 61 LHJs in Kentucky. The survey tool utilized was designed by the Center for Sharing Public Health Services, an initiative managed by the Kansas Health Institute with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Results: Seventy-two percent of the 61 LHJs in Kentucky responded to the survey. The majority of responding jurisdictions sharing services were rural, single-county jurisdictions, utilizing service-related informal sharing arrangements. The majority of health departments, when asked to identify which programmatic areas shared service arrangements were focused in, listed those services requiring intensive staff training such as Health Access Nurturing Development Services (HANDS) and epidemiology. Of particular interest were the services most infrequently shared such as communicable disease screening and treatment. Conclusions: This study suggests that, pre-COVID-19, a core group of primarily rural, single-county Kentucky local health departments has experience with cross-jurisdictional sharing. Among this group, engagement in informal arrangements was the form of cross-jurisdictional sharing predominantly used, with few jurisdictions reporting shared functions with joint oversight. When considering the potential benefits and efficiencies that cross-jurisdictional sharing can provide to public health departments and their communities, for some, COVID-19 may have been a catalyst to engage in sharing across health department jurisdictional lines."

      "abstract": "With the increasing and expansion scale of listed companies, effectiveness of internal control for listed companies has been gradually taken seriously. Effectiveness exaltation of internal control for listed companies to maximize enterprise value and rights protection of investors and stakeholders to strengthen government supervision over listed companies are of great significance. In this paper, based on previous study in effectiveness of internal control, firstly, effectiveness of internal control for listed companies is defined. Then factors affected effectiveness of internal control are studied to provide reference for future research, which will further promote sound and healthy development for internal control mechanisms of Listed company. 1. The Internal Control Effectiveness of Listed Companies 1.1 The connotation of internal control effectiveness of listed companies The effectiveness of internal control based on internal controls to ensure that the degree or level to achieve the objectives of the relevant offer. If the level of assurance in effective internal control interval, the internal controls are effective; if not ensure the level of internal control within the range, the internal controls are ineffective guarantee (1) . Effectiveness of internal control has two meanings: one refers to the company's internal control policies and measures are not inconsistent with national laws and regulations of the place; the second refers to enterprises to improve rational design of internal control framework can be very in enterprise production and business activities good to implement and can improve production efficiency, while providing true and reliable financial data to internal and external audit (2) . Effectiveness of internal controls can help companies achieve effective internal control objectives; internal control is an important guarantee to achieve the objective. From this perspective, process control, effectiveness of internal controls can be divided into the effectiveness of internal control design and operation. 1.2 The content of internal control effectiveness of listed companies Internal control assessment carried out two aspects should control the design and effectiveness of internal control operation from the inside. According to China's 2008 release of \"basic norms of internal control\", the effectiveness of internal control design can be evaluated from the perspective of the five elements of internal control, namely: internal environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and internal oversight (3) . The effectiveness of internal control and operation of internal control goals places or not to measure, these five goals are: compliance objectives, asset security objectives, reliability of financial reporting objectives, business objectives, and strategic goals."

      "abstract": "The rapid adoption of autonomous AI agents is giving rise to a new economic layer where agents transact and coordinate at scales and speeds beyond direct human oversight. We propose the\"sandbox economy\"as a framework for analyzing this emergent system, characterizing it along two key dimensions: its origins (emergent vs. intentional) and its degree of separateness from the established human economy (permeable vs. impermeable). Our current trajectory points toward a spontaneous emergence of a vast and highly permeable AI agent economy, presenting us with opportunities for an unprecedented degree of coordination as well as significant challenges, including systemic economic risk and exacerbated inequality. Here we discuss a number of possible design choices that may lead to safely steerable AI agent markets. In particular, we consider auction mechanisms for fair resource allocation and preference resolution, the design of AI\"mission economies\"to coordinate around achieving collective goals, and socio-technical infrastructure needed to ensure trust, safety, and accountability. By doing this, we argue for the proactive design of steerable agent markets to ensure the coming technological shift aligns with humanity's long-term collective flourishing."

      "abstract": "This paper offers a new privacy approach for the growing ecosystem of services -- ranging from open banking to healthcare -- dependent on sensitive personal data sharing between individuals and third parties. While these services offer significant benefits, individuals want control over their data, transparency regarding how their data is used, and accountability from third parties for misuse. However, existing legal and technical mechanisms are inadequate for supporting these needs. A comprehensive approach to the modern privacy challenges of accountable third-party data sharing requires a closer alignment of technical system architecture and legal institutional design. In order to achieve this privacy alignment, we extend traditional security threat modeling and analysis to encompass a broader range of privacy notions than has been typically considered. In particular, we introduce the concept of covert-accountability, which addresses the risk from adversaries that may act dishonestly but nevertheless face potential identification and legal consequences. As a concrete instance of this design approach, we present the OTrace protocol, designed to provide traceable, accountable, consumer-control in third-party data sharing ecosystems. OTrace empowers consumers with the knowledge of who has their data, what it is being used for, what consent or other legal terms apply, and whom it is being shared with. By applying our alignment framework, we demonstrate that OTrace's technical affordances can provide more confident, scalable regulatory oversight when combined with complementary legal mechanisms."

      "abstract": "Background: Healthcare data interoperability faces significant barriers, including regulatory compliance complexities, institutional trust deficits, and technical integration challenges. Current centralized architectures demonstrate inadequate mechanisms for balancing data accessibility requirements with patient privacy protection, as mandated by HIPAA and GDPR frameworks. Traditional compliance approaches rely on manual policy implementation and periodic auditing, which are insufficient for dynamic, multi-organizational healthcare data-sharing scenarios. Objective: This study develops and proposes a blockchain-based healthcare data management framework that leverages Hyperledger Fabric, IPFS, and the HL7 FHIR standard and incorporates automated regulatory compliance mechanisms via smart contract implementation to meet HIPAA and GDPR requirements. It assesses the theoretical system architecture, security characteristics, and scalability considerations. Methods: We developed a permissioned blockchain architecture that employs smart contracts for privacy policy enforcement and for patient consent management. The proposed system incorporates multiple certification authorities for patients, hospitals, and research facilities. Architectural evaluation uses theoretical modeling and system design analysis to assess a system’s security, compliance, and scalability. Results: The proposed framework demonstrated enhanced security through decentralized control mechanisms and cryptographic protection protocols. Smart contract-based compliance verification can automate routine regulatory tasks while maintaining human oversight in complex scenarios. The architecture supports multi-organizational collaboration with attribute-based access control and comprehensive audit-trail capabilities. Conclusions: Blockchain-based healthcare data-sharing systems provide enhanced security and decentralized control compared with traditional architectures. The proposed framework offers a promising solution for automating regulatory compliance. However, implementation considerations—including organizational readiness, technical complexity, and scalability requirements—must be addressed for practical deployment in healthcare settings."

      "abstract": "Drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents remains a formidable challenge in cancer treatment, significantly impacting treatment efficacy. Extensive research has exposed the intimate involvement of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in conferring resistance to cancer drugs. Understanding the intricate associations between ncRNAs and drug resistance is of pivotal importance in advancing clinical interventions and expediting drug development. However, traditional biological experimental methods are hampered by limitations, such as labor intensiveness, time consumption, and constraints in scalability. Addressing these challenges necessitates the development of efficient computational methods for the accurate prediction of potential ncRNA-drug resistance associations (NDRA). However, most existing predictive models primarily focus on known ncRNA-drug resistance associations, often neglecting the critical aspect of similarity information between ncRNAs and drug resistance. This oversight may hinder the accuracy of characterizing these associations. To overcome the limitations of existing computational models, we proposed B-NDRA, a computational framework designed for the discovery of drug resistance-related ncRNA. Initially, we constructed a heterogeneous graph that integrates ncRNA-drug resistance pairs, leveraging both known associations and similarity fusion information between ncRNAs and drug resistance. Subsequently, we employed an attention mechanism to aggregate local features of graph nodes following a dimensionality reduction of node features. Further, a graph neural network (GNN) facilitated the learning of global node embeddings. Notably, the integration of dual adaptive deep adjustment architectures, encompassing intrablock and interblock methodologies, enabled efficient extraction of global features while balancing local and global features. Finally, B-NDRA employed a multilayer perceptron to predict associations between ncRNAs and drug resistance. Through rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, B-NDRA achieved average AUC, AUPR, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score values of 92.2%, 91.9%, 84.88%, 86.9%, 82.37%, and 84.44%, respectively. Furthermore, comparative evaluations were conducted on established models, namely, GAEMDA, GRPAMDA, and LRGCPND. The results, obtained through three distinct 5-fold cross-validation strategies, demonstrated a notable performance improvement across almost all metrics for our B-NDRA. Specific case studies targeting Doxorubicin and Imatinib further validated the practicality of our B-NDRA in discovering potential NDRA. These results confirm the potential of our B-NDRA as a valuable tool in advancing cancer research and therapeutic development. The source code and data set of B-NDRA can be found at https://github.com/XuanLi1145/B-NDRA."

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role, multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication."

      "abstract": " \nRecursive Self-Improvement (RSI)\nIn the next issue we will publish more articles on RSI, for instance, using reinforcement learning (RL). These articles, along with, in this issue, Darwin Gödel Machine and DarwinLM, show that RSI will come in different flavors, e.g. here using evolutionary search, and have different purposes. So far, no one RSI technique itself triggers dramatic progress toward AGI.\nAgentic AI vs. AI Agents\nThe goal of Agentic AI — to render AI scalable and adaptable in complex environments — seems inherently so much more powerful than individual AI agents that the focus on progress toward artificial general intelligence should be on Agentic AI progress against benchmarks.\nClearly, the most advanced Agentic AI should be deployed to advance safety and value alignment, as Kumarage and colleagues show in this issue.\nDevelopment of Agentic AI indicates a need to focus on the type of AGI ecology that will emerge (e.g. multipolar scenarios rather than singletons), and permits using the paradigm of game theory to control safety and value alignment, as I wrote in 2019.[1] I have more to say on this subject.\nTimeline to Artificial General Intelligence 2025 – 2030+\nSenior Editor-at-Large Gil Syswerda has constructed a provocative Timeline to Artificial General Intelligence 2025 – 2030+. He gives key AI advances, economic, social, and geopolitical effects of AI. As early as 2028-2029, AI could replace the majority of human economic activity, potentially disrupting society due to widespread change happening so rapidly. But he is optimistic:\nBy the end of the decade, superintelligence is present on Earth. Human institutions are no longer in control. Everything changes in ways beyond current understanding....Humanity survives the transition—and enters an Age of Abundance. The meaning of citizenship, nationhood, and law undergoes foundational redefinition.\nArticles\nComparing Apples to Oranges: A Taxonomy for Navigating the Global Landscape of AI Regulation\nThe EU has a unified framework for regulating AI, China has its own governance structure, which it has efficiently imposed throughout China due to centralized control. Since the proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation was killed in the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ the US now seems headed toward a uncoordinated patchwork of regulation at the state and federal level. Thus, this work by Alanoca et al. is critically important and urgent. From the abstract:\nClarifying the scope and substance of AI regulation is vital to uphold democratic rights and align international AI efforts. We present a taxonomy to map the global landscape of AI regulation. Our framework targets essential metrics—technology or application-focused rules, horizontal or sectoral regulatory coverage, ex ante or ex post interventions, maturity of the digital legal landscape, enforcement mechanisms, and level of stakeholder participation—to classify the breadth and depth of AI regulation.\nAs our co-founding editor, Steve Omohundro foresaw in 2014, AI itself will play an increasing role in evolving the legacy human legal regime in general and regulations governing AI in particular:\nThe legal codes of many countries have become quite complex. Several AI projects are trying to create formal digital versions of legal codes (CodeX, 2014). These systems will eventually be used to resolve legal issues and perhaps even act as arbitrators or judges. Sophisticated AI systems with knowledge of the legal system will be used to help craft and simplify new legislation. [2]\nAccordingly, humans should initiate the process of AI taking over evolution of law, notably in the area of AI safety, with human oversight. In principle, LLMs can absorb the entire global body of human law and compare the different regimes to provide a cohesive unified over-arching structure, which no human is capable of doing. As AI progresses toward AGI, it can evolve the Alanoca et al. taxonomy to organize the diverse and inchoate international, national, and local regulatory regimes following the examples the authors provide.\nReal-World Gaps in AI Governance Research\nStrauss et al. did a massive survey of 1,178 safety and reliability papers analyzed from 9,439 generative AI papers between Jan 2020 and Mar 2025. They found significant gaps in AI governance research, particularly in post-deployment contexts and high-risk areas. ​\n\nCorporate AI research is increasingly influential, focusing on pre-deployment safety while neglecting real-world deployment issues. ​\nCorporate AI (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI) has more citations than leading academic institutions (academic institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Stanford University, University of California Berkeley, and University of Washington) – see their Table 2.\nGoogle DeepMind has more citations than the top four academic institutions combined. ​\nCorporate AI research prioritizes model alignment and testing, with less focus on deployment-stage issues like bias.\nThere is a critical lack of research on the safety and reliability of AI systems in real-world applications.\n\nAI Agents vs. Agentic AI: A Conceptual Taxonomy, Applications and Challenges\nSapkota et al. delineate agent AI vs. agentic AI, briefly giving the history and the motivation behind agentic AI toward its prime goal of scalability and adaptability in complex environments. Thus, agentic AI is a key step in the evolution of AI to AGI and superintelligence. As for safety, trust-centric operations will prioritize safety mechanisms, ensuring verifiable output and ethical compliance.\n\nAI Agents are modular systems driven by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. ​\nAgentic AI represents a paradigm shift with multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, and coordinated autonomy.\nAI Agents are autonomous software entities designed for goal-directed task execution within bounded environments. ​\nKey characteristics include autonomy, task-specificity, and reactivity with adaptation.\nAgentic AI systems manage complex, multi-step tasks requiring coordination among multiple agents..\nGenerative AI systems are stateless and lack the ability to interact with their environment autonomously.\nLLMs exhibit reactive behavior, producing output only when prompted, without autonomous goal pursuit.\nThe evolution from generative models to AI Agents is driven by the integration of large-scale language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines.\nAI Agents utilize LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA to perform adaptive planning and real-time decision-making.\nAgents function as cognitive engines that interpret user goals and manage complex workflows.\nAgentic AI systems extend the capabilities of traditional AI Agents by enabling collaboration among multiple intelligent entities.\nThey allow for goal decomposition, where user objectives are parsed into manageable tasks distributed across agents. ​\nInter-agent communication is facilitated through asynchronous messaging and shared memory\n\nMeasuring AI Agent Autonomy: Towards a Scalable Approach with Code Inspection\nHow to define “artificial general intelligence”? It’s like trying to define “life”. Most agree autonomy has to be included in defining “human-level intelligence”. In the next issue we will give our view. Here Cihon et al. present an operational definition of “autonomy” based on the agent architecture (a better description than ‘code inspection’) and without having to observe agent behavior, per se, based on an eight-component taxonomy of autonomy  – see their Figure 1. For example, human-programmed goals = no autonomy, while agent-programmed goals = autonomy.\nAs the authors note and we stress, “the level of agent autonomy is crucial for understanding both their potential benefits and risks,” i.e. AGI safety.\nDarwin Gödel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents: Main Article & Appendix F on Safety\nIn the DGM, improvement in downstream tasks directly reflects an increase in self-improvement ability, enabling the potential for self-accelerating progress.\nHowever, these [various foundation model] approaches have yet to close the self-improvement loop, meaning improvements on downstream tasks do not translate into enhanced capabilities for self-modification or the acceleration of further innovations. We aim to mimic the acceleration of science and technology, where new tools and discoveries catalyze the creation of even more discoveries. Similarly, how can we emulate nature’s arc of evolution, which bends not only toward complexity but also an ever greater capacity to evolve [26, 41, 49]?\nThis article is notable for several reasons. First, recursive self-improvement is a strong signal of progress toward AGI/SI; the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) modifies its own code. Second, Schmidhüber’s provably self-improving Gödel Machine was theoretically bold but stalled on the self-proving piece. Zhang et al. use SOTA benchmarks (SWE-bench, Polyglot) to measure various improvements and therefore prove improvement operationally. They say their ‘empirical proofs’ weaken the Gödel Machine formal approach – but I disagree – the formal methods, for example, cannot prove true statements that their axioms don’t capture. Third, we hypothesize that progress toward AGI requires broadening the ML paradigm. Here Zhang et al. incorporate evolutionary programming to generate a population of coding agents and randomly sample them to find code improvements.\nThe most critical and important application of the most advanced AI is to apply to creating safety and value alignment.\nThus, the authors point out that self-improvement can be focused on the system’s safety (which I call recursive safety improvement) and describe the safety precautions they followed.\nDarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models\nThis second article enabling AI recursive self-improvement (RSI) also uses evolutionary search, in this case to "

      "abstract": "Industrial renewal in the bio/nanopharma sector is important for the long term strength of the Australian economy and for the health of its citizens. A variety of factors, however, may have caused inadequate attention to focus on systematically promoting domestic generic and small biotechnology manufacturers in Australian health policy.Despite recent clarifications of 'springboarding' capacity in intellectual property legislation, federal government requirements for specific generic price reductions on market entry and the potential erosion of reference pricing through new F1 and F2 categories for the purposes of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) assessments, do not appear to be coherently designed to sustainably position this industry sector in 'biologics,' nanotherapeutics and pharmacogenetics.There also appears to have been little attention paid in this context to policies fostering industry sustainability and public affordability (as encouraged by the National Medicines Policy). One notable example includes that failure to consider facilitating mutual exchanges on regulatory assessment of health technology safety and cost-effectiveness (including reference pricing) in the context of ongoing free trade negotiations between Australia and China (the latter soon to possess the world's largest generic pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity). The importance of a thriving Australian domestic generic pharmaceutical and bio/nano tech industry in terms of biosecurity, similarly appears to have been given insufficient policy attention.Reasons for such policy oversights may relate to increasing interrelationships between generic and 'brand-name' manufacturers and the scale of investment required for the Australian generics and bio/nano technology sector to be a significant driver of local production. It might also result from singularly effective lobbying pressure exerted by Medicines Australia, the 'brand-name' pharmaceutical industry association, utilising controversial interpretations of reward of pharmaceutical 'innovation' provisions in the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) through the policy-development mechanisms of the AUSFTA Medicines Working Group and most recently an Innovative Medicines Working Group with the Department of Health and Ageing. This paper critically analyses such arguments in the context of emerging challenges for sustainable industrial renewal in Australia's bio/nanopharma sector."

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force driving economic expansion and innovation across industries. As organizations race to adopt AI for productivity gains, cost efficiency, and market dominance, the resulting growth has become increasingly profit-driven. However, this unregulated pursuit of technological advancement brings with it significant societal, ethical, and policy-related challenges. This research paper explores the dual nature of AI's socioeconomic impact—one marked by economic acceleration and the other by widening inequality, job displacement, and a struggle for control between corporate powerhouses and governing institutions. The core problem addressed is the lack of comprehensive governance mechanisms to balance economic incentives with the ethical and equitable deployment of AI. While AI promises significant benefits such as automation, predictive analytics, and enhanced decision-making, it also risks marginalizing underrepresented communities and concentrating power among a few technology monopolies. Our research proposes a balanced methodology: combining a literature review, comparative analysis of existing regulatory efforts, and the development of a conceptual framework integrating socio-technical ethics with economic policy. Through an architectural diagram, system design flowchart, and policy-oriented algorithm, the study outlines actionable recommendations. These include progressive AI taxation, reskilling initiatives, equitable data governance, and collaborative public-private AI governance models. By benchmarking across multiple metrics such as economic inclusivity, transparency, and scalability, the paper presents a comparative analysis of current approaches and highlights their limitations. Ultimately, the research concludes that while AI can significantly enhance socioeconomic systems, sustainable progress will only be achieved through ethical oversight and inclusive regulatory frameworks. Governments, academia, and the private sector must collaborate to redirect AI’s trajectory from unchecked profit-driven growth toward a balanced, inclusive, and equitable digital future."

      "abstract": "As the \"Belt and Road\" Initiative advances, the scale of outward investment by Chinese enterprises continues to expand, but they simultaneously face a series of obstacles. Host countries' increasingly stringent environmental regulations lead to heightened environmental legal risks. Concurrently, domestically, the absence of specialized environmental protection legislation for overseas investment, coupled with the lack of extraterritorial effect of China's Environmental Protection Law and other practical issues, results in insufficient legal oversight of outward investment, urgently necessitating systematic solutions. This paper focuses on the environmental protection obstacles faced by enterprises in their outward investment and corresponding resolution mechanisms. It emphasizes analyzing the risks posed by host country environmental regulations and the gaps in home country legal supervision, proposing pathways for the improvement of legal regulation. Based on the above research, this paper proposes a three-tier resolution mechanism. First, improve the top-level design by expediting the formulation of the Overseas Investment Environmental Protection Law and upgrading existing guidelines into administrative regulations. Second, construct a compliance firewall centered on the \"Three-Nation Law\" database, utilizing contractual liability allocation as a tool, and backed by environmental liability recourse and insurance. Third, strengthen Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), implement environmental protection strategies tailored to local conditions, and impose stricter constraints on heavily polluting industries. Finally, it is hoped that this research will help resolve the environmental legal issues faced by enterprises during their outward investment under the \"Belt and Road\" Initiative, balance economic development with environmental protection, and promote sustainable development."

      "abstract": "According to a publication by the World Health Organization, depression is projected to emerge as the leading mental health issue. In the domain of affective computing, deep learning techniques are frequently employed to represent facial dynamics using both local and global perspectives for the purpose of automatic depression detection (ADD). Yet, current models overlook the crucial interplay between local and global dynamics in discerning the significant features essential for ADD. Addressing this oversight, a novel hybrid computational architecture, named LOGLFormer, has been introduced. This architecture integrates CNN-derived local attributes and transformer-sourced global patterns tailored for ADD. Within LOGLFormer, the design philosophies of ResNet and ViT inspire the CNN and transformer branches, respectively. The synergy of these branches encompasses local convolutional mechanisms, self-attention strategies, and multilayer perceptron entities. Furthermore, the intricacies arising from disparities in CNN and transformer feature sets are reconciled through the specially devised feature alignment module. Rigorous comparative analysis underscores the distinctive efficacy of the LOGLFormer in recognizing depression, notably outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques on two dedicated depression databases: AVEC2013 and AVEC2014. Code will be available at https://github.com/helang818/LOGLFormer."

      "abstract": "This study explores generative mechanisms of curriculum design from a human-centred perspective, with a focus on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into engineering education. As curricula evolve to meet the demands of a technologically advanced and globally connected society, it is crucial to preserve the educational values rooted in human agency, cultural context, and pedagogical reasoning. The research aimed to investigate how traditional curriculum development processes can be enhanced through AI tools while preserving the essential role of human educators. A mixed-method approach was used, combining quantitative Likert-scale surveys and qualitative open-ended responses from 43 participants involved in curriculum development and implementation across higher and vocational education and industry. The results show that AI is perceived as highly effective in automating administrative tasks and personalizing learning, but concerns remain about ethical issues, data privacy, and potential marginalization of human educators. Most respondents emphasized that AI should serve as a supportive tool rather than a replacement. The findings underscore the importance of hybrid curriculum models that integrate AI for operational efficiency while maintaining human agency in decision-making, pedagogy, and ethical oversight. The study offers practical implications for future curriculum reforms and teacher training in an AI-enhanced educational landscape.\nKeywords: Curriculum Development, Artificial Intelligence in Education, Human-Centred Learning, Engineering Education, Generative Mechanism of Curricula"

      "abstract": "This article explores the critical need for standardizing AI governance by transitioning from specialist-centric approaches to inclusive frameworks that engage different stakeholders across associations. As AI systems increasingly impact business-critical decisions and nonsupervisory pressures consolidate encyclopedically, traditional governance models confined to specialized brigades have proven insufficient for managing pitfalls and maintaining trust. The composition presents a comprehensive frame for enforcing accessible AI governance through four foundational rudiments: transparent metadata factors, stakeholder-specific interfaces, cross-functional responsibility structures, and scalable oversight mechanisms. By examining design principles for user-centered governance tools and implementation strategies for distributed accountability, the article demonstrates how organizations can bridge the gap between technical complexity and business accessibility. The article reveals that successful democratization of AI governance depends on transparency as the key enabler, supported by intuitive visualization techniques, role-based access models, and systematic governance literacy programs. Through case studies and emerging stylish practices, the composition illustrates how associations enforcing inclusive governance frameworks witness smaller AI-related incidents and advanced stakeholder trust scores. The unborn vision encompasses tone-governing AI systems, interoperable governance platforms, and public-facing translucency doors that produce a new paradigm of participatory AI oversight, situating associations to thrive in a decreasingly AI-driven business geography while meeting evolving nonsupervisory conditions and societal prospects."

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with home-based rehabilitation playing a crucial role in improving patient prognosis and quality of life. Traditional health education often lacks precision, personalization, and accessibility. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are gaining attention for their potential in medical health education, owing to their advanced natural language processing capabilities. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in home-based stroke rehabilitation remains uncertain. Objective This study evaluates the effectiveness of 4 LLMs—ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen, and ERNIE Bot—selected for their diversity in model type, clinical relevance, and accessibility at the time of study design in home-based stroke rehabilitation. The aim is to offer patients with stroke more precise and secure health education pathways while exploring the feasibility of using LLMs to guide health education. Methods In the first phase of this study, a literature review and expert interviews identified 15 common questions and 2 clinical cases relevant to patients with stroke in home-based rehabilitation. These were input into 4 LLMs for simulated consultations. Six medical experts (2 clinicians, 2 nursing specialists, and 2 rehabilitation therapists) evaluated the LLM-generated responses using a Likert 5-point scale, assessing accuracy, completeness, readability, safety, and humanity. In the second phase, the top 2 performing models from phase 1 were selected. Thirty patients with stroke undergoing home-based rehabilitation were recruited. Each patient asked both models 3 questions, rated the responses using a satisfaction scale, and assessed readability, text length, and recommended reading age using a Chinese readability analysis tool. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, post hoc Tukey Honestly Significant Difference tests, and paired t tests. Results The results revealed significant differences across the 4 models in 5 dimensions: accuracy (P=.002), completeness (P<.001), readability (P=.04), safety (P=.007), and humanity (P<.001). ChatGPT-4 outperformed all models in each dimension, with scores for accuracy (mean 4.28, SD 0.84), completeness (mean 4.35, SD 0.75), readability (mean 4.28, SD 0.85), safety (mean 4.38, SD0.81), and user-friendliness (mean 4.65, SD 0.66). MedGo excelled in accuracy (mean 4.06, SD 0.78) and completeness (mean 4.06, SD 0.74). Qwen and ERNIE Bot scored significantly lower across all 5 dimensions than ChatGPT-4 and MedGo. ChatGPT-4 generated the longest responses (mean 1338.35, SD 236.03) and had the highest readability score (mean 12.88). In the second phase, ChatGPT-4 performed the best overall, while MedGo provided the clearest responses. Conclusions LLMs, particularly ChatGPT-4 and MedGo, demonstrated promising performance in home-based stroke rehabilitation education. However, discrepancies between expert and patient evaluations highlight the need for improved alignment with patient comprehension and expectations. Enhancing clinical accuracy, readability, and oversight mechanisms will be essential for future real-world integration."

      "abstract": "This article explores the evolving role of cloud data architects in developing human-centric AI systems where artificial intelligence enhances rather than replaces human capabilities. As AI becomes increasingly embedded in cloud-native architectures, a paradigm shift is occurring from viewing AI as isolated black boxes toward seeing them as collaborative partners in sociotechnical systems. The article examines fundamental principles of human-centric AI architecture: meaningful human control through tiered autonomy frameworks, transparency by design across multiple levels, and sophisticated feedback integration mechanisms. It details architectural patterns including human-in-the-loop workflows, explainable architecture with layered explanation services, and adaptive feedback systems that enable continuous learning. The article addresses implementation challenges such as balancing automation with human judgment, scaling oversight as systems grow, and effectively handling human-AI disagreements. Looking toward future directions, it explores emerging concepts of collaborative intelligence frameworks, adaptive interfaces, and embedded ethics mechanisms. Throughout, the article emphasizes that successful human-centric architecture creates systems where humans retain appropriate control while leveraging the complementary strengths of machine intelligence."

      "abstract": "Information retrieval systems face unprecedented regulatory complexity as healthcare privacy requirements, European data protection mandates, and digital market oversight converge to create multifaceted compliance challenges. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act extends beyond traditional medical records to encompass search queries, user interactions, and behavioral analytics within healthcare environments, requiring sophisticated access controls and audit mechanisms. The General Data Protection Regulation introduces comprehensive data subject rights, including erasure, portability, and consent management, that demand fundamental architectural modifications across distributed processing systems. Digital Markets Act obligations for gatekeeper platforms mandate algorithmic transparency, interoperability requirements, and fairness monitoring that conflict with traditional optimization objectives. Technical implementation challenges encompass data minimization principles in large-scale indexing, cross-border data transfer mechanisms, machine learning model explainability, and bias detection across diverse user populations. Privacy-preserving technologies, including differential privacy, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption, offer pathways for maintaining compliance while preserving analytical capabilities, though practical deployment requires substantial expertise and computational overhead. Compliance-focused architecture patterns emphasizing modular audit systems, comprehensive data governance, and flexible design principles enable adaptation to evolving regulatory requirements. The regulatory landscape continues evolving rapidly with emerging artificial intelligence governance frameworks, cross-border enforcement coordination, and industry standardization efforts that will reshape information retrieval system development."

      "abstract": "The shift to Microservices architecture and Application Programming Interface (API) - first development has transformed the landscape of software engineering, empowering development teams to create highly scalable, modular systems with agile, independent service deployment. However, the complexities of distributed architectures present unique challenges that traditional testing methodologies are often ill-equipped to address. These include managing inter-service dependencies, handling asynchronous communications, and ensuring data consistency across distributed nodes, all of which necessitate advanced testing strategies. This paper explores AI-enhanced testing strategies specifically designed for Microservices and APIs, harnessing the power of machine learning, intelligent test generation, and anomaly detection. By leveraging machine learning models trained on production data, AI-driven approaches dynamically generate high-fidelity test cases and prioritize high-risk interactions, thereby optimizing test coverage and reducing test cycle duration. Additionally, intelligent test generation replicates real-world usage scenarios, creating adaptive tests that evolve with application changes. AI-powered anomaly detection adds a crucial layer of oversight, identifying deviations from expected behavior across interconnected services and flagging potential faults before they impact production. Furthermore, self-healing test mechanisms driven by AI continuously adjust and update test configurations as APIs evolve, maintaining relevance in high-speed CI/CD environments. This paper demonstrates how AI-driven testing elevates testing precision, enhances fault detection, and enables robust quality assurance in complex, API-driven systems"

      "abstract": "This paper examines a critical gap in the Ukrainian legal framework that hinders effective criminal prosecution of large-scale tax fraud involving fictitious VAT credits. In recent years, the Ukrainian tax system has struggled to counteract the manipulation of VAT through the use of shell companies and transit enterprises, which generate artificial tax credits via fictitious transactions. While the electronic VAT administration system (SEА VAT) was introduced to automate and control the movement of tax liabilities, its design has created legal ambiguity regarding the status of VAT limits formed within it. \nThe paper substantiates the need to amend the CPC to recognize digital tax indicators, such as VAT limits, as eligible objects for pre-trial seizure, particularly when formed through suspicious or criminal schemes. The proposed legislative changes aim to ensure that such VAT amounts may be provisionally blocked to prevent their use in tax evasion or illicit budget refund claims. The author supports the proposal with legal argumentation, a review of judicial practice, and comparative insights from digital asset regulation. Key safeguards are suggested to preserve the rights of bona fide taxpayers, including judicial oversight, case-by-case analysis, and requirement of clear identification of the beneficiary or transit entity involved in the fictitious operations.\nOverall, the paper contributes to the modernization of procedural mechanisms in financial criminal law, proposes an urgent legal remedy for combating VAT fraud in wartime economic conditions, and offers a legal basis for addressing broader challenges posed by intangible digital assets within the criminal process."

      "abstract": "This study examines the design and deployment of scalable blockchain protocols that can serve as the backbone for smart city applications. The manuscript reviews existing blockchain consensus mechanisms—including Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and Proof of Authority (PoA)—and evaluates their suitability for heterogeneous smart city ecosystems. It further explores emerging scalability approaches such as sharding, sidechains, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and layer-2 protocols, alongside hybrid models that incorporate AI-driven optimization. A comparative simulation-based methodology is employed, assessing throughput, latency, and energy consumption across multiple blockchain prototypes. Results demonstrate that modular hybrid architectures leveraging sharding and DAG structures can increase throughput by up to 400% compared to traditional blockchains, with latency reductions of over 90% and significant energy savings. \nBeyond technical findings, the study contextualizes blockchain scalability within broader smart city governance frameworks, addressing interoperability between diverse urban domains such as energy microgrids, healthcare data platforms, autonomous mobility systems, and decentralized citizen services. The implications for data privacy, regulatory compliance, and citizen trust are also highlighted, emphasizing the necessity of balancing decentralization with governance oversight. By synthesizing technical, social, and policy considerations, this work contributes a comprehensive roadmap for scalable blockchain adoption in smart cities. \nUltimately, the research demonstrates that with careful architectural design and integration of scalability-enhancing techniques, blockchain can evolve from a niche financial tool into a universal urban infrastructure enabler. The findings not only advance blockchain scalability research but also provide actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and technologists seeking to design sustainable, citizen-focused smart cities."

      "abstract": "The exponential growth of global digital commerce and the increasing complexity of international data protection regulations have created unprecedented challenges for multinational enterprises managing cross-border data transfers. Traditional compliance frameworks, characterized by manual oversight and reactive monitoring systems, are proving inadequate in addressing the dynamic nature of contemporary data governance requirements. This research presents a comprehensive enterprise-wide artificial intelligence-driven compliance framework specifically designed for real-time cross-border data transfer risk mitigation in the evolving regulatory landscape of 2025. The proposed framework integrates advanced machine learning algorithms, automated risk assessment protocols, and intelligent policy enforcement mechanisms to ensure continuous compliance with diverse international data protection standards including the General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Personal Data Protection Act, and emerging regulatory frameworks across multiple jurisdictions. \nThe study employs a mixed-methods research approach, combining quantitative analysis of compliance metrics from Fortune 500 companies with qualitative assessments of regulatory challenges faced by multinational enterprises. Primary data collection involved structured interviews with 45 chief compliance officers, 38 data protection officers, and 52 information technology directors from organizations spanning North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. Secondary data analysis examined regulatory violation patterns, financial penalties, and operational disruptions associated with cross-border data transfer non-compliance incidents between 2020 and 2024. The research methodology incorporates comparative policy analysis across 28 countries, examining regulatory convergence and divergence patterns that impact enterprise compliance strategies. \nKey findings reveal that organizations implementing AI-driven compliance frameworks experience a 73% reduction in regulatory violation incidents and a 68% decrease in compliance-related operational costs compared to traditional manual compliance systems. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in real-time risk identification, automated policy adjustment, and predictive compliance analytics. Statistical analysis indicates that enterprises utilizing the AI-driven framework achieve 94% compliance accuracy rates across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously, compared to 67% accuracy rates observed in conventional compliance systems. The framework's adaptive learning mechanisms enable continuous improvement in risk prediction accuracy, with machine learning models achieving 89% precision in identifying potential compliance violations before they occur. \nThe research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in international data governance by proposing a novel theoretical model that bridges artificial intelligence capabilities with regulatory compliance requirements. Practical implications include enhanced operational efficiency, reduced regulatory risk exposure, and improved stakeholder confidence in cross-border data handling practices. The framework's modular architecture enables scalable implementation across diverse organizational structures and regulatory environments. Future research directions include longitudinal studies examining the framework's long-term effectiveness and investigations into emerging regulatory challenges associated with quantum computing and advanced AI technologies. \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence, Compliance Framework, Cross-Border Data Transfer, Risk Mitigation, Regulatory Technology, Data Governance, Machine Learning, International Data Protection, Enterprise Security, Automated Compliance."

      "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to the emergence of deepfake technology, enabling the creation of highly realistic synthetic images that closely mimic authentic visuals. This technological breakthrough, while impressive, poses significant threats in the form of misinformation, identity theft, political manipulation, and brand infringement. Deepfake image generation tools exploit deep learning algorithms to alter or fabricate images with minimal human oversight, making manual detection increasingly difficult. The need for accurate and automated detection systems has never been more critical in digital forensics and content authentication.This research presents an enhanced deepfake detection framework leveraging the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model originally designed for image classification. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that focus on local spatial patterns, ViT utilizes self-attention mechanisms to analyze global image features, making it highly capable of identifying the nuanced inconsistencies and subtle artifacts typically introduced during deepfake generation.The proposed system Is trained and evaluated on a diverse dataset comprising both real and synthetic images, collected from popular benchmarks such as FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF. During the preprocessing phase, standard image augmentation techniques are applied to increase dataset robustness. The ViT model is then fine-tuned using transfer learning and optimized with the AdamW optimizer and cross-entropy loss. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score confirm the effectiveness of the model, which significantly outperforms conventional CNN-based methods in detecting manipulated content.In addition to backend detection, a user-friendly graphical interface has been developed using Flask, enabling users to upload images and receive real-time deepfake analysis, including confidence scores and attention heatmaps for interpretability. The system not only facilitates efficient detection for forensic analysts but also empowers consumers and organizations to validate digital media authenticity.This study underscores the importance of integrating cutting-edge machine learning models like Vision Transformers in combating the rising threat of deepfakes. The results highlight the scalability, accuracy, and adaptability of the proposed framework, offering a reliable solution for real-world deployment in digital security applications.\n\nKeywords\nDeepfake, Vision Transformer, Fake Image Detection, ViT, Image Processing, Python, Machine Learning"

      "abstract": "This paper grounds ethics in evolutionary biology, viewing moral norms as adaptive mechanisms that render cooperation fitness-viable under selection pressure. Current alignment approaches add ethics post hoc, treating it as an external constraint rather than embedding it as an evolutionary strategy for cooperation. The central question is whether normative architectures can be embedded directly into AI systems to sustain human--AI cooperation (symbiosis) as capabilities scale. To address this, I propose a governance--embedding--representation pipeline linking moral representation learning to system-level design and institutional governance, treating alignment as a multi-level problem spanning cognition, optimization, and oversight. I formalize moral norm representation through the moral problem space, a learnable subspace in neural representations where cooperative norms can be encoded and causally manipulated. Using sparse autoencoders, activation steering, and causal interventions, I outline a research program for engineering moral representations and embedding them into the full semantic space -- treating competing theories of morality as empirical hypotheses about representation geometry rather than philosophical positions. Governance principles leverage these learned moral representations to regulate how cooperative behaviors evolve within the AI ecosystem. Through replicator dynamics and multi-agent game theory, I model how internal representational features can shape population-level incentives by motivating the design of sanctions and subsidies structured to yield decentralized normative institutions."

There is a critical need to evaluate the effectiveness of transparency mechanisms as a factor in legitimizing state policy. The study aims to assess whether transparency in asset recovery processes contributes to strengthening public trust in Kazakhstan’s state institutions, using evidence from public opinion, expert assessments, and media analysis. To achieve this goal, in 2023 a mixed-methods design was applied, combining a sociological survey (N = 1,383 respondents across all regions), 15 in-depth interviews with experts from government, academia, and civil society, and a content analysis of more than 300,000 media and social media mentions from 2022 to 2023. The results indicate a low level of perceived transparency of the Asset Recovery Committee, with an average score of 1.61 on a 3-point scale, which is statistically below the “partially transparent” level (t-test, p &lt; 0.05). Correlation analysis identified a strong positive relationship (r = 0.793) between public awareness of illicit capital outflows and knowledge of the Committee’s functions. SWOT and PEST analyses revealed structural, legal, and technological barriers to ensuring transparency in asset recovery processes. The study concludes that a balanced approach to information disclosure – respecting investigative confidentiality while enabling public oversight – is essential for building trust. The findings provide practical guidance for policymakers in improving transparency mechanisms, enhancing anti-corruption reforms, and strengthening public administration in Kazakhstan."

      "abstract": "The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has changed the work of enterprises, including customer service and decision-making processes, automation, and data management. The paper addresses the equilibrium that organizations must reach on the one hand to enjoy the innovational benefits of AI, and on the other hand, handle the risks that come with the AI adoption. This paper set out to examine the two-sided aspect of the AI implementation in big enterprises with a view to find best practices of regulation, ethics, and security. Based on the qualitative analysis of the present-day industry activities and recent literature, the study portrays the process of structuring internal policies according to how companies respond to legal, ethical, and operational risks and support the machine-learning derived growth. The research methodology will involve a comparative study of the case studies in realms of finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. The results show that there are some strategies common to enterprises that used AI and achieved success, i.e., creating ethical AI boards, applying interpretable models, and linking AI implementation with strategic planning processes. On the other hand, the struggling ones commonly attribute lack of regulatory clarity, skill short, or poor oversight mechanisms. Conclusively, this paper suggests possible frameworks of governance be included in the risk analysis, explainability needs, and stakeholder engagement at every point in the development and implementation of AI. The insights will help business leaders, policymakers, and researchers design scalable and innovative and conscientious AI practices."

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of cyber threats, including zero-day exploits, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, poses unprecedented risks to modern network infrastructures. Conventional defense mechanisms, while effective in certain contexts, are reactive and often dependent on human intervention, which limits their ability to mitigate fast-moving and adaptive attacks. This increasing complexity highlights the urgent need for intelligent, autonomous solutions capable of securing digital ecosystems while ensuring continuity of operations. This paper introduces a self-healing AI-driven network architecture designed to detect, contain, and recover from cyber threats in real time. At a broad level, the system integrates machine learning–based anomaly detection with automated root cause analysis to identify malicious behaviors with precision. Building on this foundation, the architecture deploys adaptive routing mechanisms and autonomous remediation protocols that dynamically reconfigure network pathways, isolate compromised nodes, and restore system integrity without requiring prolonged human oversight. By leveraging continuous learning, the model enhances its resilience over time, improving its ability to anticipate and counter novel attack strategies. Applied to scenarios involving zero-day exploits, ransomware, and large-scale DDoS events, the proposed framework demonstrates its ability to minimize downtime, prevent cascading failures, and maintain critical service delivery. Narrowing the focus, the system highlights the transformative role of self-healing mechanisms in reducing operational costs, strengthening organizational resilience, and setting new benchmarks for proactive cybersecurity. Ultimately, the work emphasizes that AI’s role is not limited to detection but extends to full-cycle recovery, positioning self-healing architectures as a cornerstone of next-generation secure networks."

This article proposes a modular Digital Code Model as a forward-looking legal framework designed to address the complexities of metaverse environments. Anchored in principles of semantic interoperability, algorithmic governance, and jurisdictional adaptability, the model introduces a layered legal architecture capable of responding dynamically to emerging digital phenomena. Key components include electronic jurisdiction, digital legal personality, AI-powered legal monitoring, and rights-based oversight mechanisms. Emphasizing the need for transnational coherence, machine-readability, and human-centric safeguards, the proposed model offers a scalable solution for regulating virtual spaces, ensuring legal predictability while preserving technological innovation and individual rights. The article outlines the theoretical foundations, structural modules, and implementation pathways of the Digital Code, positioning it as a foundational legal infrastructure for the governance of the Metaverse."

While tools such as AIF360 and Aequitas address specific dimensions, namely fairness, there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks capable of auditing multiple ethical principles simultaneously. This paper introduces a multidimensional AI auditing tool designed to evaluate\nsystems across key dimensions: fairness, explainability, robustness, transparency, bias, sustainability, and legal compliance. Unlike existing tools, our framework enables simultaneous assessment of these dimensions, supporting more holistic and accountable AI deployment. We demonstrate the tool’s applicability through use cases and discuss its implications for building trust and aligning AI development with fundamental ethical standards."

      "abstract": "With the rapid acceleration of urbanization, the scale of urban distribution networks has experienced significant growth. However, the prevalence of issues related to cable equipment quality disparities, inadequate construction process oversight, unfavorable operating conditions, and other factors has led to a pronounced increase in safety concerns for both individuals and the grid resulting from cable failures. Furthermore, the limitations of conventional online monitoring methods have posed considerable challenges in meeting the monitoring demands of widely distributed and large-scale urban distribution networks. To address these multifaceted challenges, this paper introduces the design of a low-power wireless online monitoring system grounded in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. This system is adept at concurrently monitoring multiple status signals within urban distribution networks. The proposed methodology entails the establishment of a monitoring sensing network for distribution networks, built upon IoT principles. It encompasses the optimization of low-power hardware circuitry, power management strategies, data communication protocols, and software control mechanisms, among other facets. Through the aforementioned research endeavors, the successful realization of a low-power design and application of IoT-based distributed monitoring systems for multiple signals within power distribution networks has been achieved. This accomplishment serves as a robust technical foundation for ensuring the dependable operation of urban power distribution networks."

      "abstract": "Patient- centered AI and its design means to AI system that prioritize human needs, values and capabilities. Furthermore, patient-centered AI systems shall be designed to allow for human oversight and control throughout the entire interaction process. Patient values, preferences, and capacity data, when used for patient-centered artificial intelligence systems, will present a high risk. On the one hand, this mechanism, which aims to strengthen the patient's health and prioritize their happiness, will be trained with a large amount of personal data. The data scale is very diverse. For patient preferences, data such as treatment preferences, end-of-life preferences, desire to participate in the decision-making process, confidentiality preferences, moral, religious, financial values, physical and emotional capacity will be used to train the AI system. This study examines patient-centered AI systems through the lens of high-risk artificial intelligence, emphasizing the necessity of a human oversight mechanism to ensure that the patient receives high-quality patient-centered service while the system is supervised by a human, and highlighting the need for human element oversight and supervision in diagnosis and treatment. Within the scope of the EU AI Act specifically Article 14 (Human Oversight) under the high-risk category, the risks facing patients and recommendations will be discussed. It touches on the necessity of the coexistence of the Patient-Centered AI mechanism and the Human Oversight mechanism, and in this context also sheds light on the contradictions between a patient-centered AI system and a human oversight mechanism. In this context, due to the possibility that the patient-centered AI mechanism can be added to medical devices, it is an extension, and it is a part of a software, it has also been evaluated together with the Medical Devices Regulation."

      "abstract": "This article examines how cloud technologies and middleware solutions are transforming traditionally isolated emergency response systems into interconnected networks that significantly enhance coordination during crisis events. The technical architecture of modern public safety networks leverages cloud-native infrastructure with elastic scalability, resilient design, and distributed processing capabilities that dramatically improve performance during high-demand scenarios. Microservices transformation through decomposition strategies, containerized deployment, and continuous integration pipelines enables rapid evolution of these critical systems. The middleware integration layer facilitates seamless data exchange and normalization across disparate emergency platforms. Advanced capabilities including AI-powered decision support systems, IoT sensor networks, and drone surveillance technologies extend the reach and effectiveness of emergency services. The article also addresses implementation challenges related to security considerations through zero trust architecture and reliability engineering practices. Beyond technical aspects, it examines societal implications and governance frameworks necessary to balance technological capabilities with privacy protections, algorithmic fairness, and transparent oversight mechanisms that ensure these powerful systems serve all community members equitably."

      "abstract": "As global enterprises increasingly adopt Agile at scale, orchestrating effective delivery across multi-vendor, cross-functional teams presents significant governance challenges, especially in regulated and distributed environments. This study investigates how hybrid delivery models, integrating Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principles with tailored vendor coordination strategies, can address these complexities. \nDrawing from real-world large-scale Agile transformation programs, including evidence from Visa’s enterprise initiatives, the paper introduces a governance framework designed to align distributed stakeholders, streamline risk management, and improve portfolio-level delivery consistency. The research outlines mechanisms for shared planning, tooling integration, and synchronized oversight that enable organizations to deliver predictable value while preserving Agile flexibility. \nKey transformation barriers—such as fragmented communication, inconsistent development maturity, and vendor accountability—are examined alongside mitigation practices. The framework promotes continuous improvement, harmonized delivery cadences, and performance tracking across diverse technical and organizational boundaries. \nThis paper contributes a practical roadmap for executives and program managers leading multi-vendor Agile transformations, emphasizing that success lies not just in implementing Agile methods but in adapting governance to the realities of scale and complexity. It advances both theoretical understanding and actionable strategy for cross-functional alignment, delivery resilience, and scalable Agile adoption."

      "abstract": "In recent years, convolutional neural network-based object detectors have achieved extensive applications in remote sensing (RS) image interpretation. While multi-scale feature modeling optimization remains a persistent research focus, existing methods frequently overlook the symmetrical balance between feature granularity and morphological diversity, particularly when handling high-aspect-ratio RS targets with anisotropic geometries. This oversight leads to suboptimal feature representations characterized by spatial sparsity and directional bias. To address this challenge, we propose the Parallel Interleaved Convolutional Kernel Network (PICK-Net), a rotation-aware detection framework that embodies symmetry principles through dual-path feature modulation and geometrically balanced operator design. The core innovation lies in the synergistic integration of cascaded dynamic sparse sampling and symmetrically decoupled feature modulation, enabling adaptive morphological modeling of RS targets. Specifically, the Parallel Interleaved Convolution (PIC) module establishes symmetric computation patterns through mirrored kernel arrangements, effectively reducing computational redundancy while preserving directional completeness through rotational symmetry-enhanced receptive field optimization. Complementing this, the Global Complementary Attention Mechanism (GCAM) introduces bidirectional symmetry in feature recalibration, decoupling channel-wise and spatial-wise adaptations through orthogonal attention pathways that maintain equilibrium in gradient propagation. Extensive experiments on RSOD and NWPU-VHR-10 datasets demonstrate our superior performance, achieving 92.2% and 84.90% mAP, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including EfficientNet and YOLOv8. With only 12.5 M parameters, the framework achieves symmetrical optimization of accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Ablation studies confirm that the symmetric interaction between PIC and GCAM enhances detection performance by 2.75%, particularly excelling in scenarios requiring geometric symmetry preservation, such as dense target clusters and extreme scale variations. Cross-domain validation on agricultural pest datasets further verifies its rotational symmetry generalization capability, demonstrating 84.90% accuracy in fine-grained orientation-sensitive detection tasks."

      "abstract": "AbstractThe rapid expansion of telemedicine, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has transformed healthcare delivery by enabling remote consultation, monitoring, and diagnostics. However, existing telemedicine systems often suffer from fragmented architectures, limited interoperability, and inadequate alignment with regulatory and operational requirements. This paper proposes a comprehensive architectural framework for telemedicine systems that integrates key technological components, stakeholder roles, and implementation considerations into a unified model. Through a systematic review and comparative analysis of established frameworks including outcome-oriented models, semantic healthcare standards, and emerging technology-driven architectures critical gaps were identified in current telemedicine design approaches. The proposed framework delineates modular layers encompassing user interfaces, communication protocols, service components (e.g., electronic health records and AI engines), data management, integration with third-party systems, and governance mechanisms to ensure privacy and compliance. Additionally, the framework explicitly defines the roles and responsibilities of patients, healthcare providers, system administrators, institutions, and regulatory bodies to facilitate coordinated operation and oversight. Implementation challenges such as data security, infrastructure limitations in rural areas, interoperability across diverse EHR systems, scalability, user training, and deployment costs are thoroughly discussed. This work offers a foundational reference model to guide researchers, developers, and policymakers in advancing telemedicine platforms that are scalable, secure, and interoperable. Future efforts will focus on validating the framework through simulation, prototype development, and pilot studies to enhance practical adoption and impact."

      "abstract": "Background: Political patronage, characterized by the allocation of state resources, jobs, and contracts in exchange for political loyalty, remains a persistent challenge to governance in South Asia. Rooted in historical governance structures, patronage has evolved from the Mughal-era Mansabdari system to a tool of electoral manipulation in modern political frameworks. In India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, clientelistic networks undermine institutional integrity, erode public trust, and facilitate large-scale corruption. Despite anti-corruption measures, patronage remains a dominant force in political decision-making, obstructing governance reforms and democratic accountability.\nObjective: This study aims to examine the mechanisms of political patronage in South Asia, assess its impact on governance and corruption, and analyze contemporary high-profile cases to illustrate its entrenched role in political systems.\nMethods: A qualitative research design was employed, utilizing secondary data from investigative reports, parliamentary records, judicial proceedings, and academic literature. The study incorporated a theoretical framework of clientelism to interpret the findings. Case selection criteria included the prominence of corruption cases, financial magnitude, and documented political involvement. Three case studies were analyzed: the Adani scandal (India, $250M bribe allegations), the fake accounts money laundering case (Pakistan, $5B misappropriation), and the Rooppur Nuclear Power Project fraud (Bangladesh, $5B embezzlement). Thematic analysis was conducted to identify key trends in patronage networks, corruption mechanisms, and governance failures.\nResults: The findings trace political patronage from historical origins to contemporary governance structures, revealing a systematic pattern of favoritism and financial mismanagement. In India, allegations indicate that the Adani Group acquired 1,552 hectares of public land at undervalued prices and won six major airport privatization bids under politically favorable conditions. In Pakistan, judicial investigations exposed 29 fraudulent accounts linked to high-ranking officials, revealing $10.2B in suspicious transactions. In Bangladesh, corruption allegations against the former prime minister involved $5B in financial irregularities, leading to political instability and her eventual resignation. These findings underscore how patronage weakens institutional autonomy, fuels political instability, and obstructs economic progress.\nConclusion: Political patronage remains deeply embedded in South Asia’s governance systems, obstructing transparency, meritocracy, and institutional reform. Addressing this issue requires the strengthening of independent anti-corruption bodies, enhanced transparency in campaign financing, and comprehensive socio-economic reforms. Civil society and media oversight must be reinforced to expose and counteract patron-client networks, ensuring democratic accountability and sustainable governance."

      "abstract": "The growing use of AI-driven content moderation on social media platforms has intensified ethical concerns, particularly in the context of healthcare advertising and misinformation. While artificial intelligence offers scale and efficiency, it lacks the moral judgment, contextual understanding, and interpretive flexibility required to navigate complex health-related discourse. This paper addresses these challenges by integrating normative ethical theory with organizational practice to evaluate the limitations of AI in moderating healthcare content. Drawing on deontological, utilitarian, and virtue ethics frameworks, the analysis explores the tensions between ethical ideals and real-world implementation. Building on this foundation, the paper proposes a set of normative guidelines that emphasize hybrid human–AI moderation, transparency, the redesign of success metrics, and the cultivation of ethical organizational cultures. To institutionalize these principles, we introduce a governance framework that includes internal accountability structures, external oversight mechanisms, and adaptive processes for handling ambiguity, disagreement, and evolving standards. By connecting ethical theory with actionable design strategies, this study provides a roadmap for responsible and context-sensitive AI moderation in the digital healthcare ecosystem."

      "abstract": "The apparent quality of photos taken by systems that operate in real time for oversight, object detection, and remote sensing is diminished by hazy weather. The effectiveness of these real-time systems is impacted by this. To address these issues, a real-time remover of haze mechanism must be implemented on hardware. This article offers one such solution. This article presents the hardware used to implement an image dehazing method using saturation. A 15 x 15 window lowest filter is used, which estimates the ambient light using the down sampled fuzzy image in order to achieve precise estimates. Moreover, our method is pixel-based instead of patch-based as we have used saturation-based propagation map estimate. Contrary to current patch-based techniques, the suggested technique suppresses halo artifacts around edges without the need for either an image filtering unit or an edge detecting unit. The suggested dehazing system has a seven-stage pipelined VLSI architecture. Both FPGA and ASIC (65-nm technology scale) devices are used to implement it. With only 13.2k logic gates, the suggested dehazing system's ASIC version can handle 3840 × 2160 resolution at a rate above 70 frames per second, with an optimal throughput of 624 Pixels/s."

We present AURA (Agent aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score, evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents, synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H) communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise environments."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on environmental sustainability in Nigeria’s oil and gas sector, focusing on three key governance variables: board composition, audit committee independence, and board independence. Using a survey research design, primary data were collected through a structured Likert-scale questionnaire administered to 196 respondents across selected firms. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression were employed using SPSS version 26 to analyze the data. Findings revealed that board composition, audit committee independence, and board independence each have a positive and statistically significant effect on environmental sustainability. The correlation coefficients indicated strong associations, with board composition showing the highest relationship. Regression analysis further confirmed the predictive power of the governance variables, with an R Square of 0.829, suggesting that over 82% of the variation in environmental sustainability practices can be explained by the model. The ANOVA result and F-statistic (F = 8662.235, p < 0.01) affirmed the overall significance of the model. These findings are consistent with recent studies and theoretical perspectives such as Agency Theory and Resource Dependency Theory, which highlight the role of governance structures in promoting transparency, accountability, and stakeholder responsiveness in sustainability issues. The study concludes that effective corporate governance significantly enhances environmental sustainability efforts and recommends improved board diversity, audit committee empowerment, and mandatory integration of environmental oversight into corporate governance codes."

      "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: The study aimed to develop an automated, real-time monitoring system using YOLOv8 to detect the use of safety helmets in factories, thereby improving workplace safety and compliance.\n\nBackground: Industrial safety, particularly in factories, is critical for preventing workplace accidents. The detection of safety helmets is an essential component of factory safety protocols; however, manual monitoring can be inefficient and prone to error. This study applies YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to enhance monitoring efficiency by automating the detection process, particularly in challenging conditions such as low-light environments and dynamic settings.\n\nMethodology: The YOLOv8 model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of helmet images captured in various industrial settings, encompassing different lighting conditions, angles, and helmet types to ensure the model’s robustness. The system was designed to detect the presence or absence of helmets in real time using video footage. Performance metrics, including precision, recall, and accuracy, were utilized to evaluate the model’s effectiveness, with a focus on addressing the unique challenges of real-world applications.\n\nContribution: This research contributes to the field of industrial safety by offering an automated and scalable solution for real-time helmet detection. The system significantly reduces the need for human intervention in monitoring safety compliance and provides an efficient mechanism for alerting supervisors about safety violations.\n\nFindings: The results indicated that the YOLOv8-based detection system achieved high accuracy in real-time helmet detection, even under challenging environmental conditions. The system successfully identified instances of non-compliance, allowing for timely corrective actions. Additionally, the model demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates. Statistical significance testing revealed that the model’s performance metrics, including sensitivity and specificity, showed significant improvements compared to previous versions and traditional methods (p < 0.05), underscoring the robustness of YOLOv8 in dynamic factory conditions.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: Factory managers and safety officers are encouraged to implement this system to enhance safety oversight, reduce the risk of accidents, and streamline the monitoring process without requiring extensive human resources.\n\nRecommendation for Researchers: Further research could focus on integrating additional safety features, such as detecting other protective gear (e.g., gloves, goggles), and expanding the dataset to include more diverse industrial environments.\n\nImpact on Society: Enhancing safety protocols in industrial settings has the potential to significantly reduce workplace injuries, leading to safer working environments and greater compliance with safety regulations.\n\nFuture Research: Future research may explore the integration of this system with Internet of Things (IoT) devices for broader safety monitoring and the application of YOLOv8 in detecting other safety hazards beyond helmet use.\n\n"

      "abstract": "The increasing scale, speed, and sophistication of cyber threats have outpaced traditional, human-centered security operations, prompting the development of self-learning autonomous cyber defense agents. These AI-empowered entities leverage machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, and adaptive decision-making to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real time without direct human intervention. By continuously monitoring diverse data streams such as network traffic, endpoint telemetry, and system logs these agents dynamically update their threat models, enabling rapid adaptation to evolving attack patterns, including zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Unlike rule-based systems, self-learning agents refine their performance through iterative feedback loops, allowing for proactive threat hunting, predictive risk assessment, and autonomous mitigation actions such as traffic filtering, process isolation, or automated patch deployment. However, their deployment introduces complex operational, technical, and ethical challenges, including model drift, adversarial manipulation, explainability limitations, and potential overreach in automated decision-making. Integration into security operations centers (SOCs) requires robust orchestration with existing SIEM/SOAR platforms, real-time situational awareness, and human-in-the-loop oversight for high-impact actions to maintain accountability and compliance. The architecture of such agents often incorporates multi-agent systems for coordinated defense, enabling distributed detection and response across hybrid and cloud-native infrastructures. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the design principles, learning mechanisms, and operational workflows underpinning self-learning autonomous cyber defense agents, alongside a discussion of performance metrics such as detection accuracy, false positive rates, time-to-mitigation, and adaptability to emerging threats. It further examines governance frameworks and regulatory considerations to ensure ethical deployment, resilience against adversarial AI attacks, and alignment with organizational risk appetites. By uniting adaptive AI with automated security orchestration, self-learning cyber defense agents represent a transformative leap in cyber resilience, offering the potential to outpace threat actors while reducing analyst workload and improving incident response efficiency. Yet, realizing their full potential demands careful balancing of autonomy, transparency, and human oversight to sustain operational trust and strategic control in AI-driven cybersecurity ecosystems. \n Keywords: Self-Learning, Autonomous Agents, Cyber Defense, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Security Operations, Threat Detection, Incident Response, Zero-Day Exploits, Advanced Persistent Threats, SIEM, SOAR, Explainable AI, Cyber Resilience."

      "abstract": "The article substantiates the theoretical and practical foundations for the development of compliance indicators designed to assess the maturity level of an enterprise’s economic security system. Recognizing that modern enterprises operate in increasingly complex and risk-laden environments, the study emphasizes the need for systematic tools to objectively evaluate the effectiveness and integration of compliance functions. Through a detailed analysis of internationally recognized frameworks—including those of the OECD, ISO 37301, and the UN Global Compact—and a review of best practices from corporate sectors across the EU, the USA, and Central and Eastern Europe, the study proposes a comprehensive five-level model of compliance system development: basic, formalized, integrated, proactive, and leadership levels. Each level captures the degree of institutionalization, integration, and operational depth of compliance within overall enterprise management and risk mitigation processes. \nThe research introduces a structured and multi-dimensional set of indicators, systematically grouped into five functional blocks: organizational and managerial, assessing governance structures and leadership oversight; regulatory and legal, covering policy frameworks and adherence to legal standards; monitoring, focusing on audits, incident reporting, and feedback mechanisms; training and cultural, measuring the depth of compliance awareness and staff engagement; and  innovation and digital, evaluating the use of IT tools, early-warning systems, and cybersecurity measures. A 5-point evaluation scale is proposed for each indicator, ranging from the complete absence of processes to their full integration and continuous improvement. Additionally, the methodology provides for weighted coefficients to tailor evaluations to the specific sector, size, and risk profile of the enterprise. \nAn integrated compliance maturity index is introduced as a diagnostic tool that enables enterprises to visualize their compliance strengths and vulnerabilities through a dynamic risk map. The model also incorporates benchmarking to facilitate cross-company comparisons within the same industry, fostering the adoption of best practices and enhancing overall competitive integrity. \nThe proposed model holds significant practical value for internal audits, regulatory reviews, and strategic planning in risk management and corporate governance. The findings also highlight avenues for further research, including pilot testing in various industries, advancement of digital monitoring platforms, and integration of compliance maturity assessments into broader ESG and sustainable development strategies."

      "abstract": "Our research analyzes the design of an auction model for railway transportation on the South-East Railway of Peru, managed by Ferrocarril Transandino S.A. (Fetransa) and operated by PeruRail. Initially, the regulatory framework aimed to promote competition in railway transportation through timetable auctions and infrastructure access. However, the concession has resulted in a vertically integrated structure that favors PeruRail, which faces minimal direct competition, controls high-demand time slots, and hinders the entry of other operators due to strategic and structural access barriers. To address these distortions, we propose reforming the auction mechanism to neutralize these advantages and enhance competition. In this revised framework, the track usage fee will serve as the competitive factor, with the highest bid above a minimum base rate securing the allocation. Additionally, we propose the implementation of asymmetric tariffs to compensate for the higher costs faced by operators with fewer economies of scale, technological optimizations to facilitate equitable access to time slots, and stricter oversight mechanisms to ensure transparency in timetable allocation. These measures aim to balance the market and safeguard competition through a more equitable and efficient auction design."

      "abstract": "This paper examines the design and application of key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs) for project success in global investment banking environments. The objective is to explore how performance and risk oversight mechanisms can be aligned with regulatory mandates and operational risk requirements, ensuring that transformation programs achieve both business objectives and compliance outcomes. The paper uses a literature synthesis methodology, incorporating the information on scholarly literature and regulatory frameworks, while supplemented by the examples of the industry in regards to large-scale banking projects.\nThe results indicate that KPIs, which are usually outcome-based and lagging, are critical in measuring the project delivery in terms of cost, time, and quality. Nevertheless, being predictive and leading measures, KRIs are essential in the identification of vulnerabilities in the operational control weakness, reporting errors, or system downtime. The review indicates that the successful indicator frameworks should incorporate the risk limits and escalation steps that should be in accordance to the demands of the supervisory requirements under Basel operational risk standards, as well as general regulatory requirements.\nPractical implications underline the fact that global investment banks should structure KPIs and KRIs, not only to ensure internal governance, but also to offer to the auditing and transparency to the regulatory reporting. Institutions can enhance the control and robustness by mapping risk appetite statements to quantifiable levels and relations of the indicators to escalation processes and comply with requirements. By deciding the differences and complementaries between KPIs and KRIs, the paper adds to the theory and practice by confirming the two in conjunction in determining project success, both organizationally and through regulation."

      "abstract": "The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into financial and accounting systems has redefined decision-making processes, creating both opportunities for efficiency and risks related to transparency, bias, and regulatory compliance. Traditional governance mechanisms often lag behind technological innovation, resulting in accountability gaps in algorithmic decision-making. This paper introduces the Artificial Intelligence Governance Framework for Finance (AIGF-F), a control-by-design model aimed at embedding governance, risk management, and ethical oversight directly into AI-driven accounting systems. The framework emphasizes proactive governance through three core dimensions: algorithmic transparency, embedded control mechanisms, and adaptive regulatory alignment. It incorporates auditability features such as algorithmic audit trails, explainability protocols, and fairness metrics to ensure that AI outputs remain accountable to stakeholders. By adopting a control-by-design philosophy, the AIGF-F moves governance from a reactive supervisory function to an integral component of system architecture, minimizing risks before they materialize. The framework also highlights the role of augmented human oversight, ensuring that accountants and auditors remain central in interpreting AI-driven insights and validating ethical boundaries. Furthermore, the model demonstrates how financial institutions can balance innovation with compliance by integrating dynamic monitoring tools and continuous feedback loops that adjust controls in response to evolving data environments and regulatory landscapes. For practitioners, the AIGF-F offers a structured approach to implementing AI responsibly in areas such as financial reporting, auditing, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring. For regulators, it provides a scalable framework for establishing adaptable supervisory structures capable of keeping pace with algorithmic complexity. Ultimately, this study positions AI governance not as a barrier but as an enabler of sustainable financial transformation. By embedding governance into design, the AIGF-F enhances trust, accountability, and resilience in AI-enabled accounting systems, contributing to the broader discourse on ethical and responsible digital finance. \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence Governance, Control-By-Design, Algorithmic Decision-Making, AI In Accounting, Financial Reporting, Auditability, Explainability, Fairness Metrics, Compliance Monitoring, Ethical AI. "

      "abstract": "Vision-based depth estimation is increasingly recognized as a vital technique for applications in autonomous driving and robotics due to its cost-effectiveness compared to sensor-based methods. Among the various approaches within this domain, binocular depth estimation stands out due to its ability to mimic human stereoscopic vision by deriving depth from the disparity between images captured by two aligned cameras. Despite its advantages, this technique requires extensive labeling of data, which can be both time-consuming and costly. The urgency to address this challenge is evident, as existing methods largely neglect the practical constraints associated with partial label availability. The oversight in current research has motivated our development of PLB-Net, a novel convolutional neural network specifically designed to perform depth estimation using only partially labeled datasets. By integrating attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature learning, and adaptive feature extraction, PLB-Net significantly reduces the dependency on fully labeled data while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLB-Net effectively addresses these challenges, confirming its robustness and utility in practical scenarios. This innovation makes PLB-Net especially suited for real-world applications where acquiring extensive ground truth labels is impractical, marking it as a pivotal development in the evolution of depth estimation technologies."

      "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative decoupling grid-forming (GFM) control strategy for utility-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) within weak distribution networks. Traditional control methods often fall short in providing effective frequency (f) and voltage (V) regulation primarily due to their device-centric design and reliance on P-f and Q-V droop mechanisms. These mechanisms, while suitable for inductive transmission systems, overlook the resistive nature of weak distribution grids. Consequently, this oversight results in significant active power (P) and reactive power (Q) coupling, which degrades dynamic performance and stability. To address this challenge, the proposed model adopts a systematic perspective, meticulously considering the coupling dynamics within the distribution grid. Through rigorous MATLAB and OPAL-RT simulations, this paper demonstrates the ability of the proposed control scheme to achieve precise P and Q decoupling. This enables DERs to offer accurate, autonomous f and V control, significantly improving grid stability and response. This work represents a substantial advancement in GFM control technology, addressing critical limitations in existing practices."

      "abstract": "As central banks worldwide explore the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a critical design challenge lies in reconciling user privacy with regulatory oversight [1-2]. Traditional account-based systems inherently expose transaction details, while fully anonymous approaches may conflict with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving CBDC transaction framework that combines a UTXO-based model with Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), stealth addresses, and elliptic curve cryptography. The system is implemented on Hyperledger Besu, an enterprise grade Ethereum compatible platform designed for permissioned blockchain environments. We evaluate the proposed framework through intra-bank and inter-bank transaction scenarios, analyzing throughput, latency, and resource utilization. Our results show that while privacy-enhancing mechanisms introduce cryptographic overhead, the system maintains stable performance and acceptable latency. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-scenario privacy model that enables selective transparency, allowing authorized entities—such as auditors—to access encrypted transaction metadata without compromising individual privacy. This research demonstrates the practical viability of embedding strong privacy guarantees within CBDC architectures while preserving auditability and operational efficiency. The proposed model provides a scalable and adaptable foundation for future digital currency infrastructures."

      "abstract": "Background: The incorporation of biosensors into orthopedic implants, particularly tibial components in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), marks a new era in personalized joint replacement. These smart systems aim to provide real-time physiological and mechanical data, enabling dynamic postoperative monitoring and enhanced surgical precision. Objective: This narrative review synthesizes the current landscape of electrochemical biosensor-embedded tibial implants in TKA, exploring technical mechanisms, clinical applications, challenges, and future directions for translation into clinical practice. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted across PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles were thematically categorized into technology design, integration strategies, preclinical and clinical evidence, regulatory frameworks, ethical considerations, and strategic recommendations. Findings were synthesized narratively and organized to support forward-looking system design. Results: Smart tibial implants have demonstrated feasibility in both bench and early clinical settings. Key advances include pressure-sensing intraoperative tools, inertial measurement units for remote gait tracking, and chemical biosensors for infection surveillance. However, the field remains limited by biological encapsulation, signal degradation, regulatory uncertainty, and data privacy challenges. Interdisciplinary design, standardized testing, translational funding, and ethical oversight are essential to scaling these innovations. Conclusions: Biosensor-enabled tibial components represent a promising convergence of orthopedics, electronics, and data science. By addressing the technological, biological, regulatory, and ethical gaps outlined herein, this field can transition from prototype to widespread clinical reality—offering new precision in arthroplasty care."

      "abstract": "Purpose: The accountability of public officials is a cornerstone of democratic systems; however, citizens often struggle to oversee delegated authorities effectively because of population growth and governance complexity. This study proposes a mobile application designed to bridge this gap by enabling direct citizen engagement, real-time oversight, and transparency through an autonomous accountability committee.\nMethods: This theoretical study employed a qualitative, hypothesis-driven approach that integrated governance principles, technological feasibility assessments, and comparative analyses.\nResults: The proposed framework enables structured citizen participation in accountability processes through features such as complaint submission, voting, data audits, oversight, and investigative reporting. By aligning governance processes with democratic principles, the system fosters transparency, trust, and public administration responsibility.\nConclusion: The framework for an accountability mobile application leverages technology to improve transparency, citizen engagement, and government oversight. It addresses inefficiencies in traditional systems while overcoming challenges such as data security and legal recognition. Compared with existing digital tools, this system offers stronger engagement and enforcement. Future research should focus on pilot implementations to assess their impact on governance and public trust.\nLimitations: As the research is entirely theoretical, practical challenges such as government adoption, cyber security risks, legal compliance, and technological scalability remain untested. The feasibility of implementation depends on institutional cooperation and regulatory adaptation.\nContributions: This research advances the discourse on democratic oversight, digital accountability, and citizen empowerment in public administration. Key features include AI monitoring, blockchain security, decentralized participation, and technology-based digital mechanisms, along with existing methods to ensure an effective accountability system."

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly embedded in critical decision-making processes across healthcare, finance, and education. While these technologies offer unprecedented potential for efficiency, prediction, and personalization, they also pose significant risks when designed or deployed without attention to fairness, transparency, and inclusivity. This manuscript presents a framework for advancing equitable and explainable AI (XAI) in public-impact sectors to ensure that algorithmic systems reinforce, rather than undermine, social equity and institutional trust. Equitable AI refers to models that actively mitigate disparities across demographic groups and ensure just outcomes, while explainable AI emphasizes interpretability and human comprehension of algorithmic logic. We explore the technical foundations and development pipelines required to build such systems—ranging from bias-aware data curation and model transparency methods to post-hoc interpretability tools and human-in-the-loop mechanisms. Through domain-specific applications, we demonstrate how AI can be designed to improve patient triage and care coordination, increase fairness in credit scoring and financial access, and reduce bias in academic assessments and resource distribution. We also assess outcome metrics such as disparity reduction, user comprehension, decision traceability, and stakeholder satisfaction. The findings highlight the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in the development and oversight of AI systems intended for broad societal impact. Equitable and explainable AI is not simply a technological imperative, but a moral and practical necessity for institutions seeking to deliver just, inclusive, and trustworthy services at scale. This manuscript offers actionable guidance for researchers, developers, and decision-makers committed to building algorithms that serve all communities fairly. \nKeywords: Artificial intelligence (AI), Explainable AI (XAI), Equitable AI. "

      "abstract": "The object of the study is the integrated ERP–BPMS framework designed to optimize housing and communal services (HCS). The most problematic area identified during audit was the fragmentation of personnel qualification assessments, maintenance cost forecasting, and outsourcing decisions, causing inconsistent performance metrics, increased diagnostic errors, and prolonged service-resolution times under budget constraints.\nThe research implemented three approaches: an Integral Evaluation Method (IEM) for quantifying staff competencies, a Maintenance Cost Assessment module for enhanced budget planning, and an IEM-based decision mechanism for comparing in-house versus outsourced work. These methods were integrated into the Business Operation System – Central Information System (BOS CIS) with an Information Administrator (IA) role that cross-validates digital logs against manual safety and compliance checklists.\nImplementation increased the Integral Qualification Score from 9.8 to 64.0, reducing diagnostic errors by 66 % and issue-resolution times by 50 %. Cost prediction accuracy improved from 0.76 to 0.93, while outsourcing decisions shortened project durations by 25–28.6 % and enhanced financial efficiency by 6 %. Data retrieval times decreased by 75 %, and the Information Utilization Rate rose from 65 % to 88 %. These improvements stem from the framework's real-time processing of both positive and negative performance factors and its hybrid human-machine validation process.\nThis synergy enables accurate, data-driven decisions that optimize resource allocation under strict budget limitations. Unlike solutions focusing on isolated elements, this integrated platform simultaneously addresses personnel development, cost modeling, and strategic outsourcing, increasing operational transparency and adaptability.\nThe framework is recommended for large-scale service environments where uninterrupted operation, cost-effectiveness, and high service quality are essential. By combining automated analytics with oversight, it provides a scalable model for enhancing project performance and strategic decision-making in resource-constrained service sectors."

      "abstract": "The proliferation of technological systems which permeate, and often dominate, human sociological systems is ripe for critical exploration. The purpose of this panel is to investigate the myriad ways in which technology has encroached upon—and, arguably, engineered—human behaviors, once considered the domain of psychological and biological outcomes. Additionally, this panel will offer critical insight into how disproportionate and otherwise ethically skewed technological influence may be mitigated at the point of creation in order to restore balance between tech consumer and tech creator. Topics in this panel span human migration, algorithmic encoding, human-machine communication, datafication of the human subject, glitch technology, and AI-based prediction. This panel will investigate ways in which technology has converged with human systems, often unquestioned, and offer analysis into the potential consequences of this convergence, as well as potential solutions for alleviating the omnipresence of technical sovereignty on living systems. Specific panel presentations discuss: • The inorganic digital footprint that mitigates the tangible human footprint of human migration. • The pitfalls of cybernetic prediction and the corrosive nature of AI-based prediction. • The nature of human-machine communication, as documented by interactions with Amazon Go. • Normalization of gender, as evidenced by algorithmic determination in Spotify suggestions. • The emancipatory power of “breaking” the black box of participatory technology. Each panel topic identifies technology as the basis for living systems at the socio-cultural level. For example, multiple papers investigate how algorithms seek to manage, mitigate, and encourage human behavior, while others look at the physical technological infrastructure which guides the flow of human migration. The overarching goal of each paper encourages the end-user to take a deeper look at the symbiotic relationship between digital infrastructure and living systems in order to critically examine the consequences of convergence without critical oversight. Each paper in this panel also identifies a humanistic concept that interrogates the blurring between natural and artificial, human and machine, agency, and autonomy. Dissection of the hidden blueprint of techno-socio systems requires scholars to reconsider what it means to be human and forces a critical inquiry about why, how, and under what circumstances machines can or should engineer or augment human actors, and the extent to which machines can be made to act responsibly. For example, as displaced populations are forced from their nation-states, the ethical implications that those migrants of diaspora may tailor their migratory routes to current technological infrastructure must be considered. As we evolve towards engineering more scalable communication networks capable of harnessing the allegiance of a wide swath of the population based on geographic proximity, we mustn’t neglect to consider that these networks are driving human behavior as much, if not more, than they are supporting it. Similarly, when considering the hidden philosophical blueprint that prescribes predictive artificial intelligence, we mustn’t neglect to consider the assumptions which belie this philosophy, nor the impact of systems derived from such philosophy which claim to predict the patterns of our human behavior. These research topics identify the importance and relevance of scholarship in the area of human-machine communication and advocate for their inclusion in the conceptualization, prototyping, and creation of ethical robotic and AI technologies. Increasingly, humans find themselves socializing with intelligent agents and robots at home, in schools, and at work. Further, humans often do recognize the extent to which technological systems drive human behavior. This panel offers a glimpse into the necessary, provocative, and timely discussion about HMC and the role of critical scholarship in shaping technologies of the future. As technology progresses, we find ourselves on the precipice of social and cultural evolution in which the illusory real disguised as “user-friendliness” becomes more and more ubiquitous in design theory. In many respects, the trajectory of the modern-day Internet suggests that rather than heading towards emancipation (what user-friendliness promises)--we are headed closer to invisibility. Each of these panels reveals a mechanism by which we may peek into the constructs of our techno-social reality, as so that we may mitigate the dangers of such invisibility."

      "abstract": "This study explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the grading and appeal resolution process in computer science education. We introduce AI-PAT, an AI-powered assessment tool that leverages LLMs to evaluate computer science exams, generate feedback, and address student appeals. AI-PAT was used to assess over 850 exam submissions and handle 185 appeal cases. Our multi-model comparison (ChatGPT, Gemini) reveals strong correlations between model outputs, though significant variability persists depending on configuration and prompt design. Human graders, while internally consistent, showed notable inter-rater disagreement, further highlighting subjectivity in manual evaluation. The appeal process led to grade changes in 74% of cases, indicating the need for continued refinement of AI evaluation strategies. While students appreciated the speed and detail of AI feedback, survey responses revealed trust and fairness concerns. We conclude that AI-PAT offers scalable benefits for formative assessment and feedback, but must be accompanied by transparent grading rubrics, human oversight, and appeal mechanisms to ensure equitable outcomes."

      "abstract": "The performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is intrinsically determined by the interplay between the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, which jointly govern the polarization dynamics across multiple scales. Extensive efforts have been directed toward alleviating kinetic limitations, but the essential role of thermodynamic factors, particularly under extreme operating conditions, has been largely overlooked. This oversight has impeded the development of comprehensive design principle for optimizing LIBs. In this study, we systematically investigate the coupled effects between thermodynamics and kinetics using advanced multiphysics simulations. We identify the slope of the equilibrium potential profile as a pivotal thermodynamic parameter. Steeper slopes have been demonstrated to induce stronger negative feedback, thereby effectively mitigating polarization heterogeneity and realizing the consistent electrode utilization. Based on this insight, we propose a design strategy centered on steepening the equilibrium potential to enhance thermodynamic feedback. This approach achieves a remarkable 80% reduction in polarization heterogeneity, significantly improving operational stability. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for polarization dynamics and offers actionable thermodynamic design principles, paves the way for the development of LIBs capable of extreme operating conditions."

      "abstract": "The increasing urgency of climate change has thrust carbon credit markets into the limelight as vital tools of global emission management strategies. Yet, chronic fraud, price manipulation, lack of transparency, and verification bottlenecks continue to undermine their credibility and scalability. This research investigates how artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), has the potential to transform the effectiveness, fairness, and integrity of carbon trading processes. A novel AI-driven Trust Index is introduced, incorporating anomaly detection, dynamic price forecasting, and NLP-driven document quality scoring within a single framework. Using large datasets from Verra, Gold Standard, the EU Emissions Trading System, and blockchain-based exchanges, AI models were created, tested, and piloted in a simulated carbon registry environment to determine real-world feasibility. Results demonstrate that ML models achieved 78% fraud detection correlation, price prediction accuracy with R² of 0.89, and 92% project documentation classification accuracy. Alongside technical performance, the study foregrounds ethical AI design through the integration of bias auditing, cultural sensitivity, and explainability mechanisms to facilitate equitable evaluation across Global South and community-based projects. The Trust Index model dramatically improves transparency, lowers due diligence expenses, and boosts buyer confidence, and proposes a new direction for scaling up high-integrity carbon markets. For all its revolutionary potential, real-world obstacles like data access fragmentation, institutional inertia, and the need for human oversight remain. Finally, this study presents a strategic, action-oriented agenda to policymakers, market actors, and registries to responsibly harness AI for carbon finance infrastructure, paving the way towards a more credible, inclusive, and climate-just future."

      "abstract": "Due to the fact that ischemic stroke patients comprise 60%–70% of all stroke cases, coupled with the long examination time and narrow treatment window, along with the high requirement for clinicians' experience, an accurate and rapid ischemic stroke lesion segmentation algorithm can provide clinicians with valuable assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients, which is of great clinical significance. This paper proposes a Fractional Perspective U‐Net (FPUNet), which offers a novel perspective for observing lesion features between the spatial and frequency domains, allowing for a more prominent examination of these features. Traditional spatial or frequency domain analysis restricts the observation of signals to two separate angles, making it difficult to simultaneously analyze from both perspectives; this can lead to the oversight of important signal characteristics. In contrast, the fractional domain offers a balance between time and frequency, facilitating the analysis of signals across different scales. This multi‐scale perspective enables the capture of details that may be overlooked in pure time or frequency domains. It allows for a more effective extraction of details and texture information from medical images, thereby accurately delineating the edges of stroke regions and providing clearer boundaries for pathological areas, improving the separation of lesions from the background. FPUNet is designed with a multi‐level residual structure incorporating a multi‐head attention mechanism based on the fractional domain, alongside a variant of convolutional neural network whose layers are tailored to the number of feature map channels for effective channel feature extraction. This innovative approach aims to address the challenges posed by the intricate nature of stroke, ultimately assisting clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance over state‐of‐the‐art models in both accuracy and segmentation efficacy, achieving Dice coefficients of 64.36%, 63.02%, and 86.11% on the AISD, ATLASv2.0, and ISLES22 datasets, respectively."

      "abstract": "In an era of heightened regulatory scrutiny and globalized operations, financial and insurance institutions face significant challenges in maintaining compliance across multiple jurisdictions. Designing a robust risk-based compliance framework is essential for these organizations to efficiently manage regulatory obligations while aligning compliance efforts with business objectives and risk exposure. This explores the strategic and operational considerations involved in developing such frameworks, emphasizing the need for adaptability, scalability, and legal alignment in diverse regulatory environments. A risk-based approach allows institutions to prioritize resources based on the level of exposure, likelihood, and potential impact of compliance risks. Unlike a one-size-fits-all model, it provides flexibility to account for variations in regulatory requirements across jurisdictions, such as those found in the U.S., European Union, and Asia-Pacific regions. Core components of an effective framework include governance structures, jurisdictional risk mapping, control implementation, ongoing monitoring, and regulatory reporting mechanisms. The framework must be underpinned by strong data management and supported by emerging technologies such as regulatory technology (RegTech), AI, and machine learning, which enhance surveillance and decision-making capabilities. This also addresses integration strategies, including centralized vs. decentralized compliance functions, group-level oversight, and the resolution of legal and operational conflicts arising from cross-border operations. Real-world case studies highlight common pitfalls such as siloed compliance teams or inadequate jurisdictional understanding and showcase best practices that drive organizational resilience and regulatory confidence. Ultimately, this review proposes that a well-designed risk-based compliance framework is not only a regulatory necessity but also a competitive differentiator. It enables financial and insurance firms to navigate the complexities of global regulation proactively, reduce compliance costs, and build trust with regulators, clients, and stakeholders. This approach positions organizations for sustainable growth in an increasingly interconnected and regulated financial ecosystem."

      "abstract": "The worsening environmental crisis and the increasingly visible impacts of climate change have made environmental conservation, climate change mitigation, and adaptation urgent priorities for governments around the world. However, fiscal constraints remain a significant barrier, as the scale of climate and green finance needs far exceeds the available public resources. In this context, ensuring efficient allocation of limited resources across green initiatives is critical to achieving environmental objectives while balancing developmental needs. \nGreen Budgeting has emerged as a promising tool for aligning public financial management with environmental objectives. When designed and implemented effectively, it can help governments prioritize spending, enhance transparency, and integrate climate considerations into fiscal decision-making. \nThis paper undertakes a four-pronged analysis. First, it reviews the major Green Budgeting frameworks adopted globally, highlighting their key features. Second, it examines the Green and Climate Budgeting approaches implemented by the Indian states and union territories, comparing them with the international best practices to identify gaps and areas for improvement. Third, it proposes the key elements that may be considered for the Green Budgeting framework in India—one that aligns with the country’s long-term environmental goals, considers the institutional and fiscal challenges faced by state governments, and provides guidance on integration across the budget cycle. Lastly, it proposes a Green Budgeting Index to assess the performance of Indian states in implementing Green Budgeting. The study seeks to offer practical insights into how Green Budgeting can be standardized, scaled, and made more effective in India and similar emerging economies. \nThis study observes that Green Budgeting is largely absent in India at both national and subnational levels. The Union government of India has not yet adopted Green Budgeting and only 8 out of 36 states and UTs have adopted it so far. Moreover, in the absence of a uniform national framework, states have used diverse methodologies, leading to inconsistencies. SDG mapping and integration of gender dimensions are limited. Challenges such as inadequate technical knowledge, exclusion of environmentally harmful expenditures, and a narrow focus on only direct environmental benefits hinder comprehensive assessments. Additionally, states rely heavily on traditional climate finance sources. The absence of a national oversight mechanism further limits standardization and best practice adoption, highlighting the need for systemic reforms inspired by OECD models. Thus, the need to establish a standard Green Budgeting framework in India is imperative. In this context, the paper outlines key elements for developing a comprehensive Green Budgeting framework in India and proposes an assessment index that could serve as a reference for the Government of India."

      "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of internal control and audit coordination strategies in investment fund governance, with particular emphasis on the integration of control frameworks, deficiency tracking systems, and IT General Controls (ITGCs) oversight. Drawing from firsthand audit interactions within investment fund environments, the study synthesizes current practices and identifies critical touchpoints between internal control design, real-time audit collaboration, and technology-enabled compliance. In the evolving landscape of fund governance, internal control frameworks serve as the bedrock for financial integrity, regulatory compliance, and operational resilience. However, fragmented audit processes, siloed control owners, and ineffective issue resolution mechanisms often result in recurring audit findings, delayed remediations, and elevated risk exposure. This review explores how synchronized audit coordination, particularly between internal and external audit teams, can eliminate redundancy, enhance transparency, and accelerate risk mitigation. Special focus is placed on the role of ITGCs in shaping the effectiveness of automated financial processes across fund administration systems. The review highlights successful models of ITGC collaboration with functional audits especially in access controls, change management, and data integrity to reduce material weaknesses. It further emphasizes the growing importance of cross-functional deficiency tracking platforms that centralize audit comments, streamline management responses, and monitor remediation progress against regulatory timelines. This paper identifies emerging trends such as continuous control monitoring, risk-adjusted control mapping, and integration of audit readiness tools with governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) systems. Case-based insights from real-world audit walkthroughs illustrate how funds can adopt agile audit methodologies, enforce accountability through escalation matrices, and align control environments with COSO and COBIT frameworks. By bridging audit and control operations, fund managers, compliance officers, and audit liaisons can foster a proactive governance culture that is audit-ready, data-driven, and investor-focused. The study concludes with strategic recommendations for implementing scalable audit coordination protocols, reinforcing internal controls with automation, and promoting stakeholder collaboration across fund entities."

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of state oversight relating to the non-religious activities of religious actors in Africa, whose growing influence allowed them to transform into an alternative to state institutions. In the analysis of this phenomenon, the authors use religious economy theory (religious market), which evaluates a religious organization’s competitiveness by its capacity to attract followers. A measurable indicator of such competitiveness is its growing demographic share of a certain religion within a specific region. Using an exponential growth model, the study forecasts the proportions of major religions and their branches in the African population for 2025. It is shown that, as a result of the reduction in the conversion base for Christianity and Islam due to a decrease in the number of followers of ethnic religions, the competition between these religions has increased. Based on the size, the rate of conversion growth, and the specifics of its non-religious activities, the Roman Catholic Church stands out for its high competitiveness in Africa, due to the largest scale of social service in African countries. The research underscores the significant role of social services‒education, healthcare, charity, and faith diplomacy‒in the mission strategies of these organizations, which allows them to partially fulfill state’s social functions. The authors highlight risks associated with the increasing influence of religious organizations, including their use as instruments of foreign influence, trends toward politicization, radicalization, etc. The paper outlines a set of state regulatory mechanisms designed to optimize the positive developmental impact of religious organizations while minimizing associated risks."

Large language models such as ChatGPT have intensified public expectations and apprehensions regarding AGI capabilities and risks. Existing research underestimated replicating human intelligence and lacks effective containment strategies scaled for AGI's complexity. We developed a cybersecurity-inspired framework to reconceptualize AGI containment as securing critical infrastructure indispensable for its operation. We applied game theory to model the strategic interplay between AGI and humans, drawing parallels with highly autonomous malware, emphasizing infrastructural dependencies and human countermeasures. We introduced offensive/defensive containment strategies and an AGI Kill Chain model profiling escalating AGI threats. Our game-theoretic approach examined complex AGI-human interactions revealing insights for adaptive oversight mechanisms. Game simulations demonstrated AGI carefully manages resources and autonomy balancing benefits against risks, necessitating strategic human responses. Our findings provided detailed containment tactics, emphasizing flexibility to address AGI's dynamic evolution. We proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary containment strategies, effective governance evaluating long-term efficacy, and emphasize ongoing innovation for aligning AGI progression with utility and security."

      "abstract": "Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger ones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent systems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code and Wargames. For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on general AI system capability. We then build on our findings in a theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. We also apply our theory to our four oversight games, where we find that NSO success rates at a general Elo gap of 400 are 13.5% for Mafia, 51.7% for Debate, 10.0% for Backdoor Code, and 9.4% for Wargames; these rates decline further when overseeing stronger systems."

      "abstract": " \nRecursive Self-Improvement (RSI)\nIn the next issue we will publish more articles on RSI, for instance, using reinforcement learning (RL). These articles, along with, in this issue, Darwin Gödel Machine and DarwinLM, show that RSI will come in different flavors, e.g. here using evolutionary search, and have different purposes. So far, no one RSI technique itself triggers dramatic progress toward AGI.\nAgentic AI vs. AI Agents\nThe goal of Agentic AI — to render AI scalable and adaptable in complex environments — seems inherently so much more powerful than individual AI agents that the focus on progress toward artificial general intelligence should be on Agentic AI progress against benchmarks.\nClearly, the most advanced Agentic AI should be deployed to advance safety and value alignment, as Kumarage and colleagues show in this issue.\nDevelopment of Agentic AI indicates a need to focus on the type of AGI ecology that will emerge (e.g. multipolar scenarios rather than singletons), and permits using the paradigm of game theory to control safety and value alignment, as I wrote in 2019.[1] I have more to say on this subject.\nTimeline to Artificial General Intelligence 2025 – 2030+\nSenior Editor-at-Large Gil Syswerda has constructed a provocative Timeline to Artificial General Intelligence 2025 – 2030+. He gives key AI advances, economic, social, and geopolitical effects of AI. As early as 2028-2029, AI could replace the majority of human economic activity, potentially disrupting society due to widespread change happening so rapidly. But he is optimistic:\nBy the end of the decade, superintelligence is present on Earth. Human institutions are no longer in control. Everything changes in ways beyond current understanding....Humanity survives the transition—and enters an Age of Abundance. The meaning of citizenship, nationhood, and law undergoes foundational redefinition.\nArticles\nComparing Apples to Oranges: A Taxonomy for Navigating the Global Landscape of AI Regulation\nThe EU has a unified framework for regulating AI, China has its own governance structure, which it has efficiently imposed throughout China due to centralized control. Since the proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation was killed in the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ the US now seems headed toward a uncoordinated patchwork of regulation at the state and federal level. Thus, this work by Alanoca et al. is critically important and urgent. From the abstract:\nClarifying the scope and substance of AI regulation is vital to uphold democratic rights and align international AI efforts. We present a taxonomy to map the global landscape of AI regulation. Our framework targets essential metrics—technology or application-focused rules, horizontal or sectoral regulatory coverage, ex ante or ex post interventions, maturity of the digital legal landscape, enforcement mechanisms, and level of stakeholder participation—to classify the breadth and depth of AI regulation.\nAs our co-founding editor, Steve Omohundro foresaw in 2014, AI itself will play an increasing role in evolving the legacy human legal regime in general and regulations governing AI in particular:\nThe legal codes of many countries have become quite complex. Several AI projects are trying to create formal digital versions of legal codes (CodeX, 2014). These systems will eventually be used to resolve legal issues and perhaps even act as arbitrators or judges. Sophisticated AI systems with knowledge of the legal system will be used to help craft and simplify new legislation. [2]\nAccordingly, humans should initiate the process of AI taking over evolution of law, notably in the area of AI safety, with human oversight. In principle, LLMs can absorb the entire global body of human law and compare the different regimes to provide a cohesive unified over-arching structure, which no human is capable of doing. As AI progresses toward AGI, it can evolve the Alanoca et al. taxonomy to organize the diverse and inchoate international, national, and local regulatory regimes following the examples the authors provide.\nReal-World Gaps in AI Governance Research\nStrauss et al. did a massive survey of 1,178 safety and reliability papers analyzed from 9,439 generative AI papers between Jan 2020 and Mar 2025. They found significant gaps in AI governance research, particularly in post-deployment contexts and high-risk areas. ​\n\nCorporate AI research is increasingly influential, focusing on pre-deployment safety while neglecting real-world deployment issues. ​\nCorporate AI (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI) has more citations than leading academic institutions (academic institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Stanford University, University of California Berkeley, and University of Washington) – see their Table 2.\nGoogle DeepMind has more citations than the top four academic institutions combined. ​\nCorporate AI research prioritizes model alignment and testing, with less focus on deployment-stage issues like bias.\nThere is a critical lack of research on the safety and reliability of AI systems in real-world applications.\n\nAI Agents vs. Agentic AI: A Conceptual Taxonomy, Applications and Challenges\nSapkota et al. delineate agent AI vs. agentic AI, briefly giving the history and the motivation behind agentic AI toward its prime goal of scalability and adaptability in complex environments. Thus, agentic AI is a key step in the evolution of AI to AGI and superintelligence. As for safety, trust-centric operations will prioritize safety mechanisms, ensuring verifiable output and ethical compliance.\n\nAI Agents are modular systems driven by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. ​\nAgentic AI represents a paradigm shift with multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, and coordinated autonomy.\nAI Agents are autonomous software entities designed for goal-directed task execution within bounded environments. ​\nKey characteristics include autonomy, task-specificity, and reactivity with adaptation.\nAgentic AI systems manage complex, multi-step tasks requiring coordination among multiple agents..\nGenerative AI systems are stateless and lack the ability to interact with their environment autonomously.\nLLMs exhibit reactive behavior, producing output only when prompted, without autonomous goal pursuit.\nThe evolution from generative models to AI Agents is driven by the integration of large-scale language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines.\nAI Agents utilize LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA to perform adaptive planning and real-time decision-making.\nAgents function as cognitive engines that interpret user goals and manage complex workflows.\nAgentic AI systems extend the capabilities of traditional AI Agents by enabling collaboration among multiple intelligent entities.\nThey allow for goal decomposition, where user objectives are parsed into manageable tasks distributed across agents. ​\nInter-agent communication is facilitated through asynchronous messaging and shared memory\n\nMeasuring AI Agent Autonomy: Towards a Scalable Approach with Code Inspection\nHow to define “artificial general intelligence”? It’s like trying to define “life”. Most agree autonomy has to be included in defining “human-level intelligence”. In the next issue we will give our view. Here Cihon et al. present an operational definition of “autonomy” based on the agent architecture (a better description than ‘code inspection’) and without having to observe agent behavior, per se, based on an eight-component taxonomy of autonomy  – see their Figure 1. For example, human-programmed goals = no autonomy, while agent-programmed goals = autonomy.\nAs the authors note and we stress, “the level of agent autonomy is crucial for understanding both their potential benefits and risks,” i.e. AGI safety.\nDarwin Gödel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents: Main Article & Appendix F on Safety\nIn the DGM, improvement in downstream tasks directly reflects an increase in self-improvement ability, enabling the potential for self-accelerating progress.\nHowever, these [various foundation model] approaches have yet to close the self-improvement loop, meaning improvements on downstream tasks do not translate into enhanced capabilities for self-modification or the acceleration of further innovations. We aim to mimic the acceleration of science and technology, where new tools and discoveries catalyze the creation of even more discoveries. Similarly, how can we emulate nature’s arc of evolution, which bends not only toward complexity but also an ever greater capacity to evolve [26, 41, 49]?\nThis article is notable for several reasons. First, recursive self-improvement is a strong signal of progress toward AGI/SI; the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) modifies its own code. Second, Schmidhüber’s provably self-improving Gödel Machine was theoretically bold but stalled on the self-proving piece. Zhang et al. use SOTA benchmarks (SWE-bench, Polyglot) to measure various improvements and therefore prove improvement operationally. They say their ‘empirical proofs’ weaken the Gödel Machine formal approach – but I disagree – the formal methods, for example, cannot prove true statements that their axioms don’t capture. Third, we hypothesize that progress toward AGI requires broadening the ML paradigm. Here Zhang et al. incorporate evolutionary programming to generate a population of coding agents and randomly sample them to find code improvements.\nThe most critical and important application of the most advanced AI is to apply to creating safety and value alignment.\nThus, the authors point out that self-improvement can be focused on the system’s safety (which I call recursive safety improvement) and describe the safety precautions they followed.\nDarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models\nThis second article enabling AI recursive self-improvement (RSI) also uses evolutionary search, in this case to "

      "abstract": "This paper grounds ethics in evolutionary biology, viewing moral norms as adaptive mechanisms that render cooperation fitness-viable under selection pressure. Current alignment approaches add ethics post hoc, treating it as an external constraint rather than embedding it as an evolutionary strategy for cooperation. The central question is whether normative architectures can be embedded directly into AI systems to sustain human--AI cooperation (symbiosis) as capabilities scale. To address this, I propose a governance--embedding--representation pipeline linking moral representation learning to system-level design and institutional governance, treating alignment as a multi-level problem spanning cognition, optimization, and oversight. I formalize moral norm representation through the moral problem space, a learnable subspace in neural representations where cooperative norms can be encoded and causally manipulated. Using sparse autoencoders, activation steering, and causal interventions, I outline a research program for engineering moral representations and embedding them into the full semantic space -- treating competing theories of morality as empirical hypotheses about representation geometry rather than philosophical positions. Governance principles leverage these learned moral representations to regulate how cooperative behaviors evolve within the AI ecosystem. Through replicator dynamics and multi-agent game theory, I model how internal representational features can shape population-level incentives by motivating the design of sanctions and subsidies structured to yield decentralized normative institutions."

      "abstract": "With the development of human society and scientific technology, people's material production and social activities, cultural activities, and increasing the scale of scientific research, social contact is increasingly close, between departments of human's epistemological and methodological level is increasing day by day, gradually from the height of the overall and the system to recognize and solve the problem, to form the concept of system theory and related theoretical system. This article is around the software engineering of the defects in the system structure model conversion technology. On the basis of the focus on design pattern oriented model transformation method, the model of knitting and the metadata mapping were studied, based on the model driven architecture (MDA) is designed for Web application development platform, verify the validity of the above technologies and methods. Introduction With the rapid development of information technology, especially the prosperity of the Internet has greatly changed the lifestyle of human society. A lot on the Internet as the carrier of the software system appear constantly, such as electronic commerce, electronic government affairs, battle command systems and network game network software is applied to the economy, society, military, entertainment and other fields, to the progress of human society played an immeasurable role. These systems instead of a single technology, relatively closed, compared the static structure of the software system, presents the heterogeneity, the characteristics of the open and dynamic [1]. The thought of software engineering, is in the early 1980s by Dr. Winston W. Royce put forward for the first time. He believes that the lack of system engineering method of the project, is likely to lead to software cannot be run on the selected hardware, software can't with other software and hardware system integration, software is not suitable for use for a long time [2]. In product development, oversight system, long-term not solve the software crisis will intensify. This article from the Angle of the engineering system theory to the software engineering investigation and analysis, the structure model of the elements and the mutual relationship are analyzed. Use of the established software engineering system structure model, this paper discusses the general steps in the process of software engineering, the key of object-oriented design pattern model transformation method, the model of knitting and the metadata mapping were studied, based on the model driven architecture (MDA) design for Web application development platform, verify the validity of the above technologies and methods. Overview of the software engineering related technology Related with the development of science and technology, computer technology has also obtained fast development, accordingly software quantity more and more, the scale of software is more and more big, the individual characteristics of many programs makes software more and more difficult to maintain, and produces the software crisis. In order to solve software crisis, from two aspects of technical measures and necessary organization management measures research how to better development and maintenance of computer software, and then the software engineering this emerging subject. The concept of software engineering system is to examine some of the thoughts of system theory, application engineering and research on software engineering science system, International Conference on Education Technology, Management and Humanities Science (ETMHS 2015) © 2015.

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown impressive performance in computer vision tasks, driven by the availability of large datasets and advanced deep learning techniques. This success has prompted the formal methods community to explore ways of evaluating and improving the reliability and correctness of these models. These verification efforts, however, have primarily focused on neural networks that process image or feature data, overlooking architectures designed for video data. This oversight hinders the deployment of advanced computer vision techniques for safety-critical tasks such as video surveillance, self-driving, and industrial automation, where reliable performance is required. In this work, we develop a formal verification approach for video classification tasks. This includes a novel abstract convex set definition that can represent video data (image data with a temporal component), as well as new reachability methods for layers commonly used by video classification neural networks such as three-dimensional convolutional and three-dimensional pooling layers. Additionally, we construct 3 datasets: Zoom In MNIST, Zoom Out MNIST, and GTRSB Video. These are built upon common datasets from image classification (MNIST, GTSRB). These three datasets and the ST-MNIST dataset are used to train a video classification neural network and then formally verify their robustness against $\\mathrm{L}_{\\infty}$ norm perturbations. Our results show the scalability of our approach to different input sizes and where the main challenges in this domain are."

      "abstract": "Automated Verilog code synthesis poses significant challenges and typically demands expert oversight. Traditional high-level synthesis (HLS) methods often fail to scale for real-world designs. While large language models (LLMs) have enhanced scalability, they often introduce syntactical and logical errors requiring extensive post-generation verification. Here, we introduce a novel conjunctive normal form (CNF)-guided synthesis methodology. The idea is to have an LLM generate CNF clauses, a format widely used for formal verification and synthesis validation in hardware design, but here it is used to formally describe the desired circuit functionality. These CNF specifications are then deterministically converted into Verilog, ensuring correctness by construction. Our approach fine-tunes an open-source and lightweight LLM, namely the CPU-deployable LLama-3.2-3B-Instruct model (parameters<4B), on a dataset of standard RTL components. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reliably produces functionally correct Verilog code on the first attempt, compared to other lightweight open-source SoTA works such as Verigen (2B parameters) and RTLCoder (4-bit quantized with around 7B parameters). We will release our method and data in full post peer-review."

      "abstract": "In 2003, the European Union launched the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade process, known as FLEGT. This process aims to curb illegal logging and timber trading. The key instrument to achieve this goal in partner countries is the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) licencing scheme. The FLEGT-VPA mechanism is uniquely positioned to bring focus to the domestic timber sector and offer policy measures and practical solutions through its problem-specific capacity building, public consultations and management and oversight tools, including the Timber Legality Assurance System (TLAS), chain of custody and independent third party verification. The project Pro-Formal aims to analyse which policy measures could improve the EU-FLEGT chances of success in better integrating the domestic timber markets within the national legal framework. In five selected countries, the project initially will assess different facets of the overall timber sector, be they legal or illegal, formal or informal, regulated or unregulated and small-scale or large-scale. It will also assess the interplay among these facets. Further, the project will see k to better understand the social dynamics within the timber sector of selected countries, as well as the impacts that improved policies might have on domestic timber markets and the livelihood options they currently provide. If one country wholly embraces VPA, for instance, efforts to reduce the informal timber market should not result in an indiscriminate clamp-down of chainsaw loggers that unduly undermine livelihood options at the local level. Knowledge gained from Pro-Formal work will be used to develop a menu of instruments, systems and policy options for consideration in national level VPA negotiations. The project aims to foster common sense policies that bring the domestic sector from grey and black markets into legal ones while promoting sustainable forest management and improved livelihood options."

      "abstract": "In light of the soaring uptake of distributed energy resources, distributed methods are attracting increased focus. This paper proposes an adaptive scheme to improve the convergence of the alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) on the component-based dual decomposition of the AC optimal power flow (OPF). The method incorporates a local curvature approximation scheme, with underlying parameter update steps inspired by the local residual balancing scheme, to automatically tune the penalty parameters locally, without central oversight. Substantial speed-ups over the vanilla ADMM, as high as <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$10.6$</tex-math></inline-formula> times, are demonstrated on real-world test systems with more than <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$13\\,600$</tex-math></inline-formula> buses, as well as on other difficult test cases. Furthermore, scalability is assessed by showing that, unlike in the centralized computation, the distributed implementation of the proposed adaptive method is independent of system size."

      "abstract": "Pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) consists of multiple stakeholders including raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, regulatory authorities, pharmacies, hospitals, and patients. The complexity of product and transaction flows in PSC requires an effective traceability system to determine the current and all previous product ownerships. In addition, digitizing track and trace process provides significant benefit for regulatory oversight and ensures product safety. Blockchain-based drug traceability offers a potential solution to create a distributed shared data platform for an immutable, trustworthy, accountable and transparent system in the PSC. In this paper, we present an overview of product traceability issues in the PSC and envisage how blockchain technology can provide effective provenance, track and trace solution to mitigate counterfeit medications. We propose two potential blockchain based decentralized architectures, Hyperledger Fabric and Besu to meet critical requirements for drug traceability such as privacy, trust, transparency, security, authorization and authentication, and scalability. We propose, discuss, and compare two potential blockchain architectures for drug traceability. We identify and discuss several open research challenges related to the application of blockchain technology for drug traceability. The proposed blockchain architectures provide a valuable roadmap for Health Informatics researchers to build and deploy an end-to-end solution for the pharmaceutical industry."

      "abstract": "Abstract. Along-strike variation in scarp morphology\nreflects differences in a fault's geomorphic and structural development and\ncan thus indicate fault rupture history and mechanical segmentation.\nParameters that define scarp morphology (height, width, slope) are typically\nmeasured or calculated manually. The time-consuming manual approach reduces\nthe density and objectivity of measurements and can lead to oversight of\nsmall-scale morphological variations that occur at a resolution impractical\nto capture. Furthermore, inconsistencies in the manual approach may also lead\nto unknown discrepancies and uncertainties between, and also within,\nindividual fault scarp studies. Here, we aim to improve the efficiency,\ntransparency and uniformity of calculating scarp morphological parameters by\ndeveloping a semi-automated Scarp PARameTer Algorithm (SPARTA). We compare\nour findings against a traditional, manual analysis and assess the\nperformance of the algorithm using a range of digital elevation model (DEM)\nresolutions. We then apply our new algorithm to a 12 m resolution TanDEM-X\nDEM for four southern Malawi fault scarps, located at the southern end of the\nEast African Rift system: the Bilila–Mtakataka fault (BMF) and three previously\nunreported scarps – Thyolo, Muona and Malombe. All but Muona exhibit\nfirst-order structural segmentation at their surface. By using a 5 m\nresolution DEM derived from high-resolution\n(50 cm pixel−1) Pleiades stereo-satellite imagery for the\nBilila–Mtakataka fault scarp, we quantify secondary structural segmentation.\nOur scarp height calculations from all four fault scarps suggest that if each\nscarp was formed by a single, complete rupture, the slip–length ratio for\neach earthquake exceeds the maximum typical value observed in historical\nnormal faulting earthquakes around the world. The high slip–length ratios\ntherefore imply that the Malawi fault scarps likely formed in multiple\nearthquakes. The scarp height distribution implies the structural segments of\nboth the BMF and Thyolo fault have merged via rupture of discrete faults\n(hard links) through several earthquake cycles, and the segments of the\nMalombe fault have connected via distributed deformation zones (soft links).\nFor all faults studied here, the length of earthquake ruptures may therefore\nexceed the length of each segment. Thus, our findings shed new light on the\nseismic hazard in southern Malawi, indicating evidence for a number of large\n(Mw 7–8) prehistoric earthquakes, as well as providing a new\nsemi-automated methodology (SPARTA) for calculating scarp morphological\nparameters, which can be used on other fault scarps to infer structural\ndevelopment.\n"

      "abstract": "Blockchain technology, serving as the backbone for decentralized systems, facilitates secure and transparent transactional data storage across a distributed network of nodes. Blockchain platforms rely on distributed ledgers to enable secure peer-to-peer transactions without central oversight. As these systems grow in complexity, analyzing their topological structure and vulnerabilities requires robust mathematical frameworks. This paper explores applications of graph theory for modeling blockchain networks to evaluate decentralization, security, privacy, scalability and NFT Mapping. We use graph metrics like degree distribution and betweenness centrality to quantify node connectivity, identify network bottlenecks, trace asset flows and detect communities. Attack vectors are assessed by simulating adversarial scenarios within graph models of blockchain systems. Overall, translating blockchain ecosystems into graph representations allows comprehensive analytical insights to guide the development of efficient, resilient decentralized infrastructures."

Producers of these distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (dCPS) face serious challenges with respect to designing the next generations of these machines and require proper support in making (early) design decisions to avoid expensive and time consuming oversights. This calls for efficient and scalable system-level Design Space Exploration (DSE) methods for dCPS. In this position paper, we review the current state of the art in DSE, and argue that efficient and scalable DSE technology for dCPS is more or less non-existing and constitutes a largely unchartered research area. Moreover, we identify several re-search challenges that need to be addressed and discuss possible directions for targeting such DSE technolozy for dCPS."

      "abstract": "The elimination of health disparities in the United States is a national priority and overriding goal for Healthy People 2010 (HP 2010). Surveillance of health indicators among minority populations is essential to eliminating disparities. Surveillance is critical for program planning, policy making, evaluating population-based strategies, and tracking progress toward national and state objectives. \n \nThe U.S. public health field has made steady progress in diabetes surveillance over the past decade, but there is much room for improvement (1). In this issue, Burrows et al report the findings and recommendations of an expert panel on the feasibility of using current surveys for diabetes surveillance among minority populations (2). The expert panel, convened by the Division of Diabetes Translation at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found existing surveys insufficient for diabetes survey surveillance among minority populations, and, given the realities of finite resources, the panel recommended modifying and expanding existing survey systems to improve this capacity. \n \nMany initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities are underway at the state and local levels; therefore, surveillance systems are needed at these levels. In an analysis of the capacity of states to measure HP 2010 objectives, Land found that only 56% of the objectives could be measured at the state level and 33% at the county level (3). At the state level, diabetes fared better than most other focus areas (e.g., heart disease, cancer, environmental health, immunization and infectious disease, maternal and child health) because 12 of the 14 objectives could be measured. However, if we extend this analysis to race and ethnicity objectives, only 3 diabetes mortality indicators are measurable. These HP 2010 measurable objectives are the framework for setting the U.S. health agenda and for guiding state and local health activities. Yet they cannot be used among minority populations at the state and local levels because they are not currently measurable. \n \nThe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a cornerstone of diabetes surveillance at the state level. It is used for tracking the prevalence of diabetes, risk factors for diabetes and its complications (e.g., physical inactivity, obesity), and preventive care practices among people with diabetes (e.g., adult vaccination, eye exams). Of the surveys listed by Burrows et al, the BRFSS is the only one conducted among all 50 states in a systematic, ongoing way. Unfortunately, the BRFSS remains inadequate for diabetes surveillance among minority populations. In 2000, the median state BRFSS sample size for all persons diagnosed with diabetes was 211. Thus, few states had sufficient respondents with diabetes to estimate risk factors and preventive care practices among minority populations with diabetes. \n \nAnother issue for states is the ability to establish long-term resources to conduct and maintain health surveillance among minority populations. For example, in 2001, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) began a multimillion-dollar initiative to eliminate health disparities: diabetes was one of 8 health priority areas. Part of the statute establishing the initiative specifies that \"[t]he commissioner [of health] shall enhance current data tools to ensure a statewide assessment of risk behaviors associated with the eight health disparity priority areas. The statewide assessment must be used to establish a baseline to measure the effect of activities funded.\" This is an important statement because it recognizes the need to improve statewide surveillance among minority populations. But, despite the statutory requirement to improve surveillance, the legislature mandated that all funds be distributed in grants to communities and to the MDH for oversight and programmatic support. No funds were made available for statewide improvement in surveillance systems among minority populations. \n \nEmerging minority populations within states, such as the Somali and the Hmong in Minnesota, pose additional diabetes surveillance challenges. Health surveillance data on these populations are almost nonexistent. Furthermore, new methods designed to overcome language and cultural barriers may be required for identifying and tracking diabetes indicators among these populations; traditional methods such as telephone surveys may not be feasible. \n \nIn Minnesota, one approach used to identify appropriate health indicators for surveillance is participatory research partnerships (PRPs). This approach involves partnerships among African American, African immigrant, American Indian, Hispanic, and Asian immigrant communities to understand health concepts and other cultural issues and to determine appropriate health indicators. The challenge of systematically and regularly monitoring these health indicators remains. \n \nAt the state and local levels, expanding the BRFSS or developing new surveys for diabetes surveillance among minority communities will be costly. To expand diabetes surveillance, states must look to alternatives such as health care administrative data (e.g., hospital discharge, Medicare, Medicaid, managed care). Even though such data only pertain to people under medical care, analyzing data already being collected may be the most efficient way of expanding diabetes surveillance among minority populations. \n \nUnfortunately, many hospitals and most managed care organizations do not systematically collect or report race and ethnicity information. The Institute of Medicine, in a report on disparities in health care, has recommended that race and ethnicity, education level, and primary language data all be collected and reported in a standardized way and included in hospital and managed care performance measurement (4). A pilot project among 8 managed care organizations (MCOs) has begun exploring methods for assessing racial and ethnic disparities within their populations. Bierman et al have outlined the importance of using race and ethnicity data by MCOs as well as highlighted potential barriers to collecting racial and ethnic data — barriers such as perceived legal, business, and confidentiality concerns (5,6). \n \nIn Minnesota, statutory language was developed to require insurers to provide claims data — and eventually race and ethnicity data — to the MDH for the purpose of public health research and surveillance. Public concerns about data confidentiality curtailed this initiative, even though sophisticated methods for ensuring confidentiality were in place. The MDH continues to garner support from health care providers, MCOs, and other stakeholders and to articulate the purpose, need, and confidentiality safeguards for a statewide medical claims database. Such large-scale efforts, either voluntary or statutory, are underway in many states and can considerably enhance state and local diabetes surveillance among minority populations. \n \nCurrent state diabetes surveillance systems among minority populations must be improved if we are to make progress toward eliminating racial and ethnic disparities or to know if we are even making progress. Expanding current surveillance surveys, although less expensive than starting new surveys, will require substantial financial resources and long-term commitment. For some populations (recent immigrants, for example) new surveillance methods may be required. The use of alternative surveillance data sources, such as health care administrative data, will have financial ramifications and raise confidentiality concerns. Ultimately, a concerted and committed effort by public health and health care organizations to begin systematically collecting and reporting data on race and ethnicity is needed and will benefit all."

      "abstract": "Public agencies like the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) award tens of billions of dollars in annual science funding. How can this money be distributed as efficiently as possible to best promote scientific innovation and productivity? The present system relies primarily on peer review of project proposals. In 2010 alone, NSF convened more than 15,000 scientists to review 55,542 proposals 1 . Although considered the scientific gold standard 2 , peer review requires significant overhead costs 3, 4 , and may be subject to biases, inconsistencies, and oversights 5‐17 . We investigate a class of funding models in which all participants receive an equal portion of yearly funding, but are then required to anonymously donate a fraction of their funding to peers. The funding thus flows from one participant to the next, each acting as if he or she were a funding agency themselves. Here we show through a simulation conducted over large-scale citation data (37M articles, 770M citations) that such a distributed system for science may yield funding patterns similar to existing NIH and NSF distributions, but may do so at much lower overhead while exhibiting a range of other desirable features. Self-correcting mechanisms in scientific peer evaluation can yield an efficient and fair distribution of funding. The proposed model can be applied"

      "abstract": "Vendor performance evaluation is a strategic element in retail supply chains, ensuring that suppliers deliver consistent value in terms of cost, quality, delivery, and compliance. This study explores how data-driven evaluation systems, contract management practices, and performance enforcement mechanisms collectively enhance supply chain efficiency and resilience. A quantitative, explanatory research design was adopted, with data collected through a structured questionnaire distributed to procurement managers, supply chain executives, and contract administrators. Purposive sampling ensured that respondents were directly involved in vendor oversight, while secondary data such as procurement reports and vendor scorecards were used to triangulate findings. Responses measured on a five-point Likert scale captured operational metrics, financial sustainability, and compliance adherence, along with the role of digital contract management systems in monitoring obligations, penalties, and incentives. Data analysis combined descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test hypothesized relationships between evaluation metrics, contract enforcement, and retail performance outcomes. Results indicate that operational metrics, particularly on-time delivery and quality conformance, remain central, but financial measures such as cost-to-serve and invoice accuracy, alongside compliance metrics, increasingly shape contractual decisions. Digital platforms were shown to transform contract management by enhancing transparency, reducing risks, and linking performance evaluation directly with enforceable actions. Performance-based contracting further aligned supplier incentives with retailer objectives, fostering accountability and continuous improvement. Overall, the findings highlight that vendor performance evaluation is no longer a static measurement process but a dynamic, data-driven framework that integrates analytics, scorecards, and contract enforcement to strengthen decision-making, supplier collaboration, and long-term competitiveness in the retail sector."

      "abstract": "In their article, Ragan and colleagues (1) make the latest case for a national, coordinated biobanking system to support clinical decision making and translational research— to enable an efficient and facile response to a pandemic. In the absence of an existing resource, these authors had to launch their own biobanking operation to serve the urgent needs of their patient, physician, and scientist communities in themidst of a protracted internationalmedical crisis. Their biobanking effort included obtaining patient consent, collecting specimens, and annotating samples with clinical data. Specimens were collected from inpatients and outpatients after retrieval from clinical pathology laboratories and autopsies, and patient-specific clinical data were painstakingly linked to specimens. Oversight committees were established to review applications for specimen use and arbitrate the distribution of samples. Challenging under the best of circumstances, these activities faced formidable obstacles during the pandemic. Coordinated support fromphysicians, nurses, hospital staff, and administration was required. In the absence of federal support, the hospital and private foundations shouldered the burden of funding despite the likelihood of national benefit. Meeting these challenges de novo during a global public health emergencywas aHerculean task. The banking of human biological samples requires strict adherence to scientific, ethical, and regulatory requirements. The mere—albeit colossal—organizational and administrative feat of collecting specimens, data, and patient consent and sagely adjudicating their distribution is insufficient. Specimen quality is at least as important as quantity. To guarantee the quality of the specimens distributed to users, biobanks must impose data-driven, evidencebased, standard operating procedures for sample collection, handling, processing, and storage. Procedures for ensuring the security of protected health information linked to samples must be established and vigilantly monitored. Further, an overarching quality management system is necessary for preventive and corrective action to continually course-correct across the enterprise. These additional aspects of biobanking are a heavy lift. Whether the biobanking system described by Ragan and colleagues achieved them all is unclear. Molecular analysis of biospecimens demands a high level of molecular integrity of the sample. Without strict attention to and control of critical preanalytic variables that have the capacity to alter molecular composition and quality of specimens, biobanks risk contributing to the problem of irreproducible data polluting the archives of biomedicine. Today's powerful analytic technologies ensure a result when a molecular test is done on a specimen. The challenge is ensuring that the result reflects the pathobiology of the patient's disorder and not merely the artefact introduced by problematicmanipulation of the specimen. Biobanking done correctly is not for the faint of heart. It requires massive coordination of patients, medical professionals, ethicists, scientists, information technologists, managers, administrators, and fundraisers. Although it is the sine qua non of translational research, funders frequently deny biobanking sufficient financial support. Europe has a vast, government-funded, well-coordinated biobanking infrastructure, the Biobanking and BioMolecular resources Research Infrastructure–European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC). However, discounting the networked biobanks associated with federally funded clinical trials groups, the United States lacks national biobanking. Therefore, most efforts, from massive undertakings like The Cancer Genome Atlas program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute to projects initiated by single investigators, rely on institutional biobanks. These biobanks often lack enforced standards and sustained funding. Global and national authoritative sources, such as the International Organization for Standardization (2), the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (3), the NCI (4), and the BiorepositoryAccreditationProgramof theCollegeofAmerican Pathologists (5), issue best practices for biobanking. Unfortunately, all of these are voluntary, and none are widely enforced. For such an essential component of research, it is unthinkable that biobanking continues to be so problematic. Large-scale biobanking in the United States lacks constitutive funding, quality regulation, scalability, and sustainability. As demonstrated by Europe's BBMRI-ERIC, it is possible to develop interoperable, standardized, federated systems capable of amassing the requisite type, quality, and quantity of biological samples and associated clinical data needed to support research. There is little question that BBMRI-ERIC has made Europe more competitive in the translational research arena. Biobanking systems could—and some would argue should—be goal-specific. In this regard, patient advocacy groups have successfully stepped in to fill the biobanking void to accelerate research related to their specific diseases of interest. Yet, too much specificity can be limiting. Even a pandemic-focused biobanking effort, such as the one Ragan and colleagues suggest, requires specimens from patients with a range of underlying conditions to enable study of disease interactions and synergies, prognosis, and variation in response to therapy. Some, including myself, have long believed that a national, high-quality biobanking infrastructure is sorely needed and long overdue. Others, like Ragan and colleagues, have become believers under the duress of a biomedical emergency. Such an infrastructure unfortunately requires substantial investment and commitment on a national level, which can become a political issue. An April 2021 poll suggested that the hesitancy to accept COVID-19 vaccination is largely due to distrust of science (6). If the public does not trust the science that directly and immediately benefits them, it is difficult to believe"

      "abstract": "We propose that hierarchical organizations can engender and sustain the collaboration of large numbers of autonomous actors by establishing self-managed, mission-aligned collectives. Informing our claim are preliminary findings from an ongoing study of the housing movement in São Paulo, Brazil. Unexpectedly, we find that hierarchical Social Movement Organizations (SMOs) have, for more than three decades, incentivized broad-based voluntary engagement in protest actions aimed at formulating new housing policy by educating and encouraging low-income families to join collectives tasked with developing and self-managing new housing projects. We trace the sustainability of this participation architecture to an SMO-designed, points-based system, which functions as an integrating mechanism affording: (1) goal alignment between large numbers of autonomous actors and the leadership of a hierarchical organization; (2) voluntary engagement by autonomous actors in activities that simultaneously address local and higher order goals; (3) role and task allocation without legal control or close oversight; and (4) retention within the participation architecture by equipping autonomous actors with structure and measurable progress towards local goals and fairly distributing benefits of collective work. We discuss implications to our understanding of how to achieve concerted action at scale towards a grand challenge."

      "abstract": "The latest advancements in distributed ledger technology (DLT) and payment architectures such as the UK’s New Payments Architecture present opportunities for leveraging the hidden informational value and intelligence within payments. In this paper, we present Smart Money, an infrastructure capability for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) which enables real-time value-added tax split payments, oversight, controlled access, and smart policy implementation. This capability is implemented as a prototype called Making Tax Smart (MTS), which utilises the open-source R3 Corda DLT framework. The results presented herein confirm that it is feasible to build an MTS capability which is scalable and co-exists with the current payment systems. Smart Money CBDC has the potential to mobilise payments data, transforming the role of money from a blunt instrument to a government policy sensor and actuator without disrupting the existing money system. DLT, smart contracts, and programmable money have a crucial role to play with benefits for government departments, the economy, and society as a whole."

      "abstract": "\n Distinct from the conventional manufacturing paradigm, the functioning of the Social Manufacturing (SocialM) model relies on a vast and dispersed array of social manufacturing resources. SocialM communities/groups emerge autonomously through business interactions, resource self-organization, and production information sharing, all driven by product orders within the SocialM system. This necessitates a more open, distributed, and autonomous software model to facilitate the allocation and operation of social manufacturing resources in support of the SocialM model. Consequently, this paper introduces a novel software development model designed specifically for SocialM. This proposed model employs business interaction software as the system's primary control portal, enabling efficient management of resources and users based on the social manufacturing communities/groups. Additionally, it facilitates the administration and oversight of numerous applications by utilizing an industrial Appstore. Moreover, the paper delves into the technological roadmap for realizing the essential technologies of the software model by integrating multi-agent and MQTT technologies. A 3D printing task simulation case was employed to demonstrate the model's working principle, which served to confirm the reliability and scalability of the SocialM software, as well as the feasibility of the SocialM theory."

      "abstract": "In a time characterized by mounting apprehensions regarding data security and confidence in digital transactions, there's a growing need for a reliable and transparent framework to oversee the origin and legitimacy of goods along the supply chain. Concerns such as counterfeiting, deceit, and operational inefficiencies are prevalent across various sectors, causing skepticism and financial setbacks. The primary issue stems from the absence of an immutable and decentralized ledger to uphold the accuracy of product data from production to distribution. Through facilitating stakeholders in monitoring product trajectories from inception to delivery, our goal is to bolster trust and alleviate fraudulent activities. In centralized systems, control and decision-making authority are vested in a singular entity or a small group of entities. This concentration of power enables streamlined direction and oversight over all activities within the system. Conversely, decentralization distributes authority across multiple entities or individuals, empowering them to make decisions autonomously within their spheres of influence. Decentralized systems often promote greater flexibility, adaptability, and resilience as decision-making is dispersed, allowing for localized responses and innovation.  In today's digital age, individuals and businesses face an overwhelming deluge of textual data, spanning social media updates, customer feedback, and online commentary. Yet, deciphering this unstructured text presents a formidable hurdle, impeding the timely comprehension of public sentiment, viewpoints, and trends. Consequently, there arises a critical necessity for an effective and automated sentiment analysis solution capable of swiftly and accurately gauging sentiment within text, empowering users to glean insights into public perceptions and make well-informed decisions. Our sentiment analysis application endeavors to address this challenge by offering an automated, scalable, and precise sentiment analysis tool suited for diverse applications, encompassing marketing, customer service, brand management, and market research."

      "abstract": "This article substantiates a new paradigm for managing state target programs based on distributed logic implemented through blockchain technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). The theoretical section analyzes the limitations of the centralized model for implementing state target programs, particularly high transaction costs, corruption risks, and management inefficiencies inherent in hierarchical systems. The research demonstrates that a distributed approach based on blockchain ensures data immutability and implementation transparency (through smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations), while AI application enables predictive analytics and dynamic resource planning, enhancing program adaptability. The authors propose a conceptual model of a «Distributed Target-Program» (DTP), which combines decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for program management, smart contracts with KPIs for automatic performance control, a network of AI agents for monitoring and forecasting, and funding mechanisms through digital funds \nThe methodological section provides a systematic analysis of experiences implementing distributed logic elements in Ukraine and worldwide. Examples examined include Estonia’s blockchain-based integrity of state registries, UN/World Food Programme (WFP) projects using blockchain for humanitarian assistance, digitalization of public services in Ukraine (the «Diia» mobile application), and blockchain solution experiments in the public sector. The research includes comparative case analyses of Ukrainian examples, such as blockchain implementation in social assistance provision (WFP Building Blocks project in Ukraine), the scale of digital aid payments through «Diia» (eSupport program), and DAO technology application in public administration. \nSpecial attention is given to assessing the regulatory compliance of the proposed solutions. The analysis covers current Ukrainian legislation in digital governance and public finance, as well as AI regulatory requirements according to the EU AI Act 2024/1689. The research demonstrates that implementing the DTP model requires legal framework adaptation (particularly defining DAO status and ensuring transparency and oversight of AI algorithms). \nThis work is valuable for researchers and practitioners in public administration as it combines an interdisciplinary approach (public administration, information technology, legal aspects) and offers an innovative vision for the digital transformation of state programs."

      "abstract": " \nRecursive Self-Improvement (RSI)\nIn the next issue we will publish more articles on RSI, for instance, using reinforcement learning (RL). These articles, along with, in this issue, Darwin Gödel Machine and DarwinLM, show that RSI will come in different flavors, e.g. here using evolutionary search, and have different purposes. So far, no one RSI technique itself triggers dramatic progress toward AGI.\nAgentic AI vs. AI Agents\nThe goal of Agentic AI — to render AI scalable and adaptable in complex environments — seems inherently so much more powerful than individual AI agents that the focus on progress toward artificial general intelligence should be on Agentic AI progress against benchmarks.\nClearly, the most advanced Agentic AI should be deployed to advance safety and value alignment, as Kumarage and colleagues show in this issue.\nDevelopment of Agentic AI indicates a need to focus on the type of AGI ecology that will emerge (e.g. multipolar scenarios rather than singletons), and permits using the paradigm of game theory to control safety and value alignment, as I wrote in 2019.[1] I have more to say on this subject.\nTimeline to Artificial General Intelligence 2025 – 2030+\nSenior Editor-at-Large Gil Syswerda has constructed a provocative Timeline to Artificial General Intelligence 2025 – 2030+. He gives key AI advances, economic, social, and geopolitical effects of AI. As early as 2028-2029, AI could replace the majority of human economic activity, potentially disrupting society due to widespread change happening so rapidly. But he is optimistic:\nBy the end of the decade, superintelligence is present on Earth. Human institutions are no longer in control. Everything changes in ways beyond current understanding....Humanity survives the transition—and enters an Age of Abundance. The meaning of citizenship, nationhood, and law undergoes foundational redefinition.\nArticles\nComparing Apples to Oranges: A Taxonomy for Navigating the Global Landscape of AI Regulation\nThe EU has a unified framework for regulating AI, China has its own governance structure, which it has efficiently imposed throughout China due to centralized control. Since the proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation was killed in the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ the US now seems headed toward a uncoordinated patchwork of regulation at the state and federal level. Thus, this work by Alanoca et al. is critically important and urgent. From the abstract:\nClarifying the scope and substance of AI regulation is vital to uphold democratic rights and align international AI efforts. We present a taxonomy to map the global landscape of AI regulation. Our framework targets essential metrics—technology or application-focused rules, horizontal or sectoral regulatory coverage, ex ante or ex post interventions, maturity of the digital legal landscape, enforcement mechanisms, and level of stakeholder participation—to classify the breadth and depth of AI regulation.\nAs our co-founding editor, Steve Omohundro foresaw in 2014, AI itself will play an increasing role in evolving the legacy human legal regime in general and regulations governing AI in particular:\nThe legal codes of many countries have become quite complex. Several AI projects are trying to create formal digital versions of legal codes (CodeX, 2014). These systems will eventually be used to resolve legal issues and perhaps even act as arbitrators or judges. Sophisticated AI systems with knowledge of the legal system will be used to help craft and simplify new legislation. [2]\nAccordingly, humans should initiate the process of AI taking over evolution of law, notably in the area of AI safety, with human oversight. In principle, LLMs can absorb the entire global body of human law and compare the different regimes to provide a cohesive unified over-arching structure, which no human is capable of doing. As AI progresses toward AGI, it can evolve the Alanoca et al. taxonomy to organize the diverse and inchoate international, national, and local regulatory regimes following the examples the authors provide.\nReal-World Gaps in AI Governance Research\nStrauss et al. did a massive survey of 1,178 safety and reliability papers analyzed from 9,439 generative AI papers between Jan 2020 and Mar 2025. They found significant gaps in AI governance research, particularly in post-deployment contexts and high-risk areas. ​\n\nCorporate AI research is increasingly influential, focusing on pre-deployment safety while neglecting real-world deployment issues. ​\nCorporate AI (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI) has more citations than leading academic institutions (academic institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Stanford University, University of California Berkeley, and University of Washington) – see their Table 2.\nGoogle DeepMind has more citations than the top four academic institutions combined. ​\nCorporate AI research prioritizes model alignment and testing, with less focus on deployment-stage issues like bias.\nThere is a critical lack of research on the safety and reliability of AI systems in real-world applications.\n\nAI Agents vs. Agentic AI: A Conceptual Taxonomy, Applications and Challenges\nSapkota et al. delineate agent AI vs. agentic AI, briefly giving the history and the motivation behind agentic AI toward its prime goal of scalability and adaptability in complex environments. Thus, agentic AI is a key step in the evolution of AI to AGI and superintelligence. As for safety, trust-centric operations will prioritize safety mechanisms, ensuring verifiable output and ethical compliance.\n\nAI Agents are modular systems driven by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. ​\nAgentic AI represents a paradigm shift with multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, and coordinated autonomy.\nAI Agents are autonomous software entities designed for goal-directed task execution within bounded environments. ​\nKey characteristics include autonomy, task-specificity, and reactivity with adaptation.\nAgentic AI systems manage complex, multi-step tasks requiring coordination among multiple agents..\nGenerative AI systems are stateless and lack the ability to interact with their environment autonomously.\nLLMs exhibit reactive behavior, producing output only when prompted, without autonomous goal pursuit.\nThe evolution from generative models to AI Agents is driven by the integration of large-scale language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines.\nAI Agents utilize LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA to perform adaptive planning and real-time decision-making.\nAgents function as cognitive engines that interpret user goals and manage complex workflows.\nAgentic AI systems extend the capabilities of traditional AI Agents by enabling collaboration among multiple intelligent entities.\nThey allow for goal decomposition, where user objectives are parsed into manageable tasks distributed across agents. ​\nInter-agent communication is facilitated through asynchronous messaging and shared memory\n\nMeasuring AI Agent Autonomy: Towards a Scalable Approach with Code Inspection\nHow to define “artificial general intelligence”? It’s like trying to define “life”. Most agree autonomy has to be included in defining “human-level intelligence”. In the next issue we will give our view. Here Cihon et al. present an operational definition of “autonomy” based on the agent architecture (a better description than ‘code inspection’) and without having to observe agent behavior, per se, based on an eight-component taxonomy of autonomy  – see their Figure 1. For example, human-programmed goals = no autonomy, while agent-programmed goals = autonomy.\nAs the authors note and we stress, “the level of agent autonomy is crucial for understanding both their potential benefits and risks,” i.e. AGI safety.\nDarwin Gödel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents: Main Article & Appendix F on Safety\nIn the DGM, improvement in downstream tasks directly reflects an increase in self-improvement ability, enabling the potential for self-accelerating progress.\nHowever, these [various foundation model] approaches have yet to close the self-improvement loop, meaning improvements on downstream tasks do not translate into enhanced capabilities for self-modification or the acceleration of further innovations. We aim to mimic the acceleration of science and technology, where new tools and discoveries catalyze the creation of even more discoveries. Similarly, how can we emulate nature’s arc of evolution, which bends not only toward complexity but also an ever greater capacity to evolve [26, 41, 49]?\nThis article is notable for several reasons. First, recursive self-improvement is a strong signal of progress toward AGI/SI; the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) modifies its own code. Second, Schmidhüber’s provably self-improving Gödel Machine was theoretically bold but stalled on the self-proving piece. Zhang et al. use SOTA benchmarks (SWE-bench, Polyglot) to measure various improvements and therefore prove improvement operationally. They say their ‘empirical proofs’ weaken the Gödel Machine formal approach – but I disagree – the formal methods, for example, cannot prove true statements that their axioms don’t capture. Third, we hypothesize that progress toward AGI requires broadening the ML paradigm. Here Zhang et al. incorporate evolutionary programming to generate a population of coding agents and randomly sample them to find code improvements.\nThe most critical and important application of the most advanced AI is to apply to creating safety and value alignment.\nThus, the authors point out that self-improvement can be focused on the system’s safety (which I call recursive safety improvement) and describe the safety precautions they followed.\nDarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models\nThis second article enabling AI recursive self-improvement (RSI) also uses evolutionary search, in this case to "

      "abstract": "In modern analytics environments, where data pipelines span multiple sources, transformations, and destinations, ensuring continuous data quality has become a critical operational priority. This systematic review investigates recent advances in end-to-end pipeline observability as a key strategy for maintaining data quality assurance across complex analytics systems. Following PRISMA methodology, we analyzed peer-reviewed articles, industry whitepapers, and technical case studies published between 2015 and 2024 to synthesize emerging practices, technologies, and challenges. Our findings reveal that traditional monitoring techniques are inadequate for today’s distributed, multi-cloud, and real-time analytics pipelines. Modern pipeline observability frameworks extend beyond basic uptime metrics, incorporating multi-layered visibility across ingestion, transformation, storage, and consumption stages. Innovations include metadata-driven anomaly detection, real-time data drift monitoring, lineage tracking, schema evolution alerts, and SLA-based data quality checks. Tools such as Monte Carlo, Databand, Soda, and OpenLineage are leading a new generation of observability platforms that offer comprehensive insights into data freshness, completeness, accuracy, and trustworthiness. Integrating observability natively into orchestration systems (e.g., Airflow, Dagster) and embedding data reliability SLAs into business operations have become best practices for proactive quality management. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, including scalability in high-velocity environments, managing observability across heterogeneous ecosystems, and balancing automation with human oversight. Furthermore, standardization of observability metrics and the integration of ethical frameworks for responsible data monitoring remain underdeveloped. This review concludes by proposing future research directions, including the development of autonomous, self-healing observability systems, cross-cloud observability standards, and frameworks for measuring the business impact of data quality issues. As analytics systems grow increasingly complex, mastering end-to-end pipeline observability will be vital for building resilient, trustworthy, and high-performing data infrastructures."

      "abstract": "The study aimed to identify the extent of the importance of the Governance Committee and its independence in Islamic financial and banking institutions and the Fatwa and Sharia Supervision Board and their integration in limiting non-compliant earnings with Islamic Sharia. This study gains its importance from the importance of the topic it deals with and the important implications it carries in limiting earnings that are not compatible with Islamic law and the future of Islamic banks in maximizing halal earnings and ending unlawful earnings through the Governance Committee and the Fatwa and Sharia Supervision Board and their integration in limiting earnings that are not compatible with Sharia And because it is one of the rare studies that dealt with the relationship of the independence of the Governance Committee and the involvement of the Fatwa and Sharia Supervisory Board to limit the profit that is not compatible with Islamic Sharia in Islamic banks. In order to achieve the desired goals of our study, a methodology based on an analysis of the direct credit financing returns in the Arab Islamic Bank was relied upon, and the returns that are not compatible with Islamic law from direct credit financing, comparing that revenue that resulted from direct credit financing with the revenues that are not compatible with Islamic law that resultedFor direct creditfinancing (vertical analysis) based onthe actual figures as stated in the financial statements of the Arab Islamic Bank The study also relied on an electronic questionnaire that was designed to suit the objectives and hypotheses of the study and was distributed to a sample of the study complex, where the study population (685 Arab Islamic Bank employees) and the total number of questionnaires received from employees reached 71 questionnaires, and the results were analyzed using the SPSS statistical analysis program. This study concluded with several results, the most important of which are: - There is a statistically significant effect of the existence of the Governance Committee on the reduction of non-sharia-compliant earnings in Islamic banks at the level of (α ≤ 0.05). - There is a statistically significant effect of the presence of the Fatwa and Sharia Supervisory Authority on the reduction of non-Sharia-compliant earnings in Islamic banks at the level of (α ≤ 0.05). - There is a statistically significant relationship between the Governance Committee and the Supervision and Fatwa Authority in Islamic banks to limit gains that are not compatible with Islamic Sharia. In order to reduce the profit incompatible with Islamic law in the financial and banking institutions, the researcher recommended the interest of Palestinian institutions and companies in applying governance on an expanded scale, as well as allocating an independent committee for governance, and not being satisfied with the presence of a governance committee integrated with other committees.And directing financial institutions to establish a Sharia Supervisory Authority that would have direct links with the Governance Committee. The researcher also recommended the support of the researchers to delve deeper into the study of governance as a legal oversight body and their impact on financial institutions and their results.It also encourages investmentin Islamic financial institutions because of their consolidation of the principles of Islamic financial law in halal earning. Universities and educational institutions design a master's program concerned with the study of Islamic governance.And providing government supportto Islamic banking and financial institutions by reducing taxes or fees, taking into account their expenses in accordance with Islamic Sharia and the controls of Sharia laws governing banking work. It also provides awareness programs for citizens about governance, its nature and benefits. And the government carrying out comprehensive programs to consolidate governance as a comprehensive way of life. In conclusion, Islamic banks and Islamic banking institutions carry out publication campaigns about their Islamic work system, the aspects of disbursing profits that are not compatible with Islamic Sharia, and the legal control methods used to limit the gain that is not compatible with Islamic Sharia"

      "abstract": "In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as IoT and wearable devices has led to significant advancements, particularly in the realm of remote patient monitoring. Despite these advancements, the traditional client/server architecture prevalent in current implementations presents substantial challenges related to security and privacy, leaving healthcare systems vulnerable to various attacks. Consequently, stringent regulatory and security measures are imperative to safeguard health data. To address these challenges and meet regulatory requirements, transitioning to a distributed architecture is essential. Blockchain technology, renowned for its distributed nature and robust security features, offers a promising solution to mitigate the security risks inherent in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these considerations, this study introduces HealthLink—a secure healthcare framework that seamlessly integrates IoT and Blockchain technologies.HealthLink is designed to facilitate remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that require continuous oversight. The framework prioritizes security, scalability, and processing efficiency. Security measures include the use of re-encryption proxies combined with Blockchain for hash data storage, while access control is managed through smart contracts. To enhance Blockchain scalability, an off-chain IPFS-based database is employed for data storage, and the Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority is leveraged to expedite data storage processes. As a practical demonstration, we apply the HealthLink system to diabetes management, presenting execution results through system interfaces. Experimental findings highlight substantial enhancements in the security of healthcare systems compared to conventional methodologies, underscoring the potential of HealthLink to revolutionize remote patient monitoring and data security in healthcare."

      "abstract": "Drinking water contamination, a known determinant of adverse health outcomes, remains widespread and inequitably distributed amidst aging infrastructure. Regulatory oversight is the primary tool to protect drinking water-related public health risks, with maximum contaminant levels established to regulate concentrations for contaminants of concern. However, the extent to which existing concentrations of contaminants at the public water system level directly affect population health remains poorly understood. Here we present a large-scale data analysis of 20 million water samples from 2012-2022 in California to assess the impact of drinking water quality on all-cause mortality. Surfactants were associated with increases in mortality, potentially serving as proxies for wastewater contaminants. We further find evidence of mixture effects that were unidentifiable through single-contaminant analysis, suggesting mixtures of toxic metals as well as salinity constituents are associated with mortality. These results could inform public health efforts to mitigate mortality associated with consumption of contaminated drinking water."

      "abstract": "This article explores the critical need for standardizing AI governance by transitioning from specialist-centric approaches to inclusive frameworks that engage different stakeholders across associations. As AI systems increasingly impact business-critical decisions and nonsupervisory pressures consolidate encyclopedically, traditional governance models confined to specialized brigades have proven insufficient for managing pitfalls and maintaining trust. The composition presents a comprehensive frame for enforcing accessible AI governance through four foundational rudiments: transparent metadata factors, stakeholder-specific interfaces, cross-functional responsibility structures, and scalable oversight mechanisms. By examining design principles for user-centered governance tools and implementation strategies for distributed accountability, the article demonstrates how organizations can bridge the gap between technical complexity and business accessibility. The article reveals that successful democratization of AI governance depends on transparency as the key enabler, supported by intuitive visualization techniques, role-based access models, and systematic governance literacy programs. Through case studies and emerging stylish practices, the composition illustrates how associations enforcing inclusive governance frameworks witness smaller AI-related incidents and advanced stakeholder trust scores. The unborn vision encompasses tone-governing AI systems, interoperable governance platforms, and public-facing translucency doors that produce a new paradigm of participatory AI oversight, situating associations to thrive in a decreasingly AI-driven business geography while meeting evolving nonsupervisory conditions and societal prospects."

Wind, solar, and battery systems can provide energy storage and complementary generating profiles. Renewable resources are unpredictable, making modelling and controlling difficult and limiting performance. Traditional prediction, optimisation, and control methods are inferior to AI. This critical analysis examines AI-based modelling and control methods for small scale wind-photovoltaic battery distributed generating systems. This paper objectively evaluates AI approaches strengths and weaknesses and discusses their practical applications in energy flow optimisation and renewable resource variability. Oversight is necessary for those implementing AI solutions and researchers making breakthroughs. The evidence presented here demonstrates that artificial intelligence can potentially improve distributed energy systems' efficiency, dependability, and sustainability."

      "abstract": "Data Mesh architecture emerges as a transformative paradigm addressing fundamental limitations of traditional centralized data management systems. The architecture represents a sociotechnical evolution that decentralizes data ownership to domain teams while treating data as products with clear quality standards and customer service commitments. This paradigm shift addresses critical scalability bottlenecks, quality challenges, and governance complexities that constrain conventional data lake and warehouse implementations. The architecture draws inspiration from microservices patterns, decomposing monolithic data platforms into domain-specific products that enable independent development, deployment, and maintenance cycles.\nFour foundational principles underpin Data Mesh implementations: domain-oriented decentralized ownership, data as product thinking, self-serve infrastructure platforms, and federated computational governance. These principles collectively enable organizations to reduce dependencies on centralized teams while improving data accessibility and business value realization. The architecture emphasizes automated governance mechanisms over manual oversight, enabling scalable compliance across distributed data product ecosystems. Implementation requires significant organizational transformation beyond technical architecture changes, involving cultural shifts toward greater autonomy and accountability within domain teams. Success factors include organizational readiness, platform capability investments, and commitment to new operating models that balance domain autonomy with global standards and interoperability requirements."

      "abstract": "In multi-agent systems, emergent norms and distributed decision-making often produce unanticipated behaviors that complicate traditional AI governance frameworks. This paper introduces an adaptive accountability method that traces responsibility flows among networked agents, continuously detects adverse emergent norms, and intervenes to recalibrate local objectives or policies in near real time. By combining lifecycle-based auditing, decentralized governance, and norm detection algorithms, our approach enables robust oversight in dynamic, evolving environments. To validate its scalability and effectiveness, we conduct a series of large-scale simulation experiments on up to 100 agents using an HPC environment. Our ablation studies—covering multiple seeds, varied penalty settings, and different intervention policies—demonstrate that the framework can preserve high collective reward while significantly reducing inequality. In particular, we show that adaptive interventions prevent harmful collusion or hoarding in over 90% of tested configurations, even under partial observability. These results indicate that our method not only mitigates unforeseen disruptions but also aligns agent behaviors with ethical and legal guidelines at scale. Overall, the resulting framework offers a practical path toward ethically sound, multi-agent AI systems that remain responsive to shifting data distributions, organizational policies, and real-world complexity."

      "abstract": "Information retrieval systems face unprecedented regulatory complexity as healthcare privacy requirements, European data protection mandates, and digital market oversight converge to create multifaceted compliance challenges. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act extends beyond traditional medical records to encompass search queries, user interactions, and behavioral analytics within healthcare environments, requiring sophisticated access controls and audit mechanisms. The General Data Protection Regulation introduces comprehensive data subject rights, including erasure, portability, and consent management, that demand fundamental architectural modifications across distributed processing systems. Digital Markets Act obligations for gatekeeper platforms mandate algorithmic transparency, interoperability requirements, and fairness monitoring that conflict with traditional optimization objectives. Technical implementation challenges encompass data minimization principles in large-scale indexing, cross-border data transfer mechanisms, machine learning model explainability, and bias detection across diverse user populations. Privacy-preserving technologies, including differential privacy, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption, offer pathways for maintaining compliance while preserving analytical capabilities, though practical deployment requires substantial expertise and computational overhead. Compliance-focused architecture patterns emphasizing modular audit systems, comprehensive data governance, and flexible design principles enable adaptation to evolving regulatory requirements. The regulatory landscape continues evolving rapidly with emerging artificial intelligence governance frameworks, cross-border enforcement coordination, and industry standardization efforts that will reshape information retrieval system development."

      "abstract": "This article explores promising directions for developing and enhancing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) using artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) represents a modern networking approach that decouples control functions from data forwarding mechanisms, thereby enabling centralized oversight and flexible reconfiguration of network components. However, in conditions of limited resources, such as computing power, memory, or bandwidth, traditional SDN approaches face significant challenges in maintaining performance, security, and adaptability.\nThe study emphasizes the integration of machine learning (ML) algorithms for solving tasks related to access control, intelligent traffic distribution, detection of anomalies, and efficient allocation of cloud and edge resources. Particular attention is given to lightweight AI models that can operate on conventional hardware without requiring specialized equipment. Several practical cases are considered, including the use of clustering and classification algorithms to support decision-making in resource-constrained SDN nodes.\nThe paper also analyses the benefits of AI for improving the resilience and scalability of SDN controllers, including support for distributed intelligence and partial decentralization of control logic. This is especially relevant for hybrid infrastructures where centralized cloud services coexist with edge computing devices. Additionally, the article discusses the potential of AI in reducing energy consumption, enhancing quality of service (QoS), and enabling predictive analytics in dynamic network environments.\nThe results of this research highlight the relevance of AI-driven SDN for future communication systems, particularly in scenarios where access to computing and network resources is limited. The proposed approaches contribute to the vision of building smarter, more adaptive, and resource-efficient software-defined infrastructures."

      "abstract": "The shift to Microservices architecture and Application Programming Interface (API) - first development has transformed the landscape of software engineering, empowering development teams to create highly scalable, modular systems with agile, independent service deployment. However, the complexities of distributed architectures present unique challenges that traditional testing methodologies are often ill-equipped to address. These include managing inter-service dependencies, handling asynchronous communications, and ensuring data consistency across distributed nodes, all of which necessitate advanced testing strategies. This paper explores AI-enhanced testing strategies specifically designed for Microservices and APIs, harnessing the power of machine learning, intelligent test generation, and anomaly detection. By leveraging machine learning models trained on production data, AI-driven approaches dynamically generate high-fidelity test cases and prioritize high-risk interactions, thereby optimizing test coverage and reducing test cycle duration. Additionally, intelligent test generation replicates real-world usage scenarios, creating adaptive tests that evolve with application changes. AI-powered anomaly detection adds a crucial layer of oversight, identifying deviations from expected behavior across interconnected services and flagging potential faults before they impact production. Furthermore, self-healing test mechanisms driven by AI continuously adjust and update test configurations as APIs evolve, maintaining relevance in high-speed CI/CD environments. This paper demonstrates how AI-driven testing elevates testing precision, enhances fault detection, and enables robust quality assurance in complex, API-driven systems"

      "abstract": "The ATLAS detector will undergo major upgrades before data-taking at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider will start in 2030. One of the main upgrades is a new radiation-hard inner tracking detector with a fast readout which is needed to cope with the high pile-up interaction rate (with up to 200 additional interactions per bunch crossing). Building this detector is an international effort and involves a large-scale manufacture of parts following a complex production flow across institutes. To maintain the tight production schedule and ensure the detector is build to specifications, continuous oversight of the build status is essential. For this purpose, a Production Database was developed which is a fully functional distributed data management system. It will be in use for the remaining years of construction and for 10 years of detector operation. The production database functionality and its usage is described in these proceedings."

      "abstract": "Recent advances in AI are transforming AI's ubiquitous presence in our world from that of standalone AI-applications into deeply integrated AI-agents. These changes have been driven by agents'increasing capability to autonomously make decisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those applications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels of AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems and users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write and execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to autonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without human oversight, traditional security approaches fall short. This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI systems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI agents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks within specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to systematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and AI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures used to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams to: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across technical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI components without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3) holistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific product context. This approach is particularly relevant for securing agentic systems with complex autonomous capabilities. By focusing on assets rather than attacks, our approach scales with the rapidly evolving threat landscape while accommodating increasingly complex and distributed AI development pipelines."

      "abstract": "In the era of intelligent and sustainable development, artificial intelligence (AI) presents novel approaches for optimizing tax administration. This study delves into the potential of K-means clustering analysis in tax source management, leveraging AI’s data analysis prowess to refine the classification and oversight of enterprise tax sources in China. The research identifies four pivotal indicators — corporate income tax, net operating cash flow, total assets, and tax payable — for effectively monitoring enterprise tax payment status. Through clustering analysis and the incorporation of sustainability metrics, 433 listed companies are precisely categorized into three tiers: key, secondary key, and general tax source enterprises. This study unveils the latent application potential of K-means clustering in tax source management, offering governments and institutions a novel, efficient tool for tax data analysis. It addresses challenges such as the vastness and complexity of tax data, tax loophole identification, and tax plan optimization. With the proliferation of IoT-based fiscal and tax monitoring systems, enterprises generate immense volumes of tax-related data. K-means clustering, known for its computational simplicity and efficacy, provides a solution for real-time data classification and anomaly detection in these large-scale distributed data settings. By employing K-means clustering analysis, this study gains profound insights into the internal structure and latent patterns of tax data, facilitating more accurate tax trend predictions, anomaly detection, and the formulation of targeted tax policies."

      "abstract": "Despite a slow pace, Nuclear Power is undergoing a global renaissance. Small modular reactors (SMR) and microreactors are in various design and commissioning phases. These are designed to be built in factories and installed onsite, providing a means to rapidly deploy nuclear power while controlling for uncertain capital expenditures and cost overruns. The OECD (2016) is projecting that by 2035 we could have 21 GWe of new nuclear electricity capacity installed globally with 3.5 GWe in the United States.Simultaneously, renewables such as wind and solar are growing exponentially and battery electric vehicles are gaining traction in the energy sector. If vehicles transition to battery electric vehicles (BEV) our electricity consumption would roughly double. The energy grid as a whole is evolving as numerous point source generators come online and smarter grids enable better resource management and dynamic pricing. The result will be a distributed energy market where individuals and utilities both buy and sell resources in a fast-paced, brokered market. Or perhaps more accurately, autonomous agents will buy and sell resources on behalf of utilities, individuals, and intermediaries.The pertinent question then becomes how do we have human oversight of resources to maintain safe, secure, and reliable operation?A reasonable approach is to examine assets as three general classes. The first class comprises commodity consumer-oriented devices such as home solar, battery storage, and BEVs represented distributed nano-scale devices. The capital expenditures of any single device or installation are relatively small, and the potential consequences of a single installation failing are relatively small. Minimal regulatory oversight is required for individual installations. The second class comprises distributed micro-scale devices like nuclear micro-reactors and small modular reactors. These will have substantial automation compared to existing Generation II reactors. They could incorporate remote operations and monitoring at the fleet scale, with the ability to shut down systems locally. Disruptions would have costly impacts to an organization or municipality.Lastly, at the other end of the spectrum are high-value assets with the potential for low-probability high consequence events. These would include gigawatt-scale nuclear/solar/hydro plants that might also have flexible operations to support onsite data centers, hydrogen production, or cryptomining. These assets would be high-value targets and distruptions would have the potential for severe economic, environmental, and functional consequences at large geographic scales. When we start thinking about human oversight, participation, and decision making, the first class is consumer-oriented. Consumers will be enabled to become prosumers (producers and consumers) sell excess or optimize energy usage and storage based on dynamic rates.The third class of high-value assets resembles how critical infrastructure is managed today. These high-value assets are conservative and slow to evolve through the adoption of automation and operational changes. They would still need to maintain high degrees of human vigilance compared to the other systems for regulatory adherence and maintaining cyber-physical security and reliability.The second class still has high regulatory requirements. However, it is a bit of a clean slate to conceptualize operations and monitoring from first principles with high levels of automation and mixed-initiative monitoring and control (AI/human teaming). In this paper we explore those possibilities.New SMR and microreactors incorporate passive safety and modern engineering modeling and analysis that wasn't available during the design and commisioning of Generation II reactors. The result is reactors that have significantly reduced risks of catastrophic melt-down events like Fukishima. This dramatically expands the possibilities for how they can be monitored and controlled. When we ponder what modern nuclear control rooms should look like we envision multiple operators monitoring dozens of screens to maintain situational awareness and readiness to respond at a moments notice. However, this is unlikely and perhaps even undersired. Once reactors, in particular microreactors, have the demonstrated capability of operating hands-free with minimal oversight it becomes misguided to install humans to maintain constant vigilance (e.g. Level 4 to 5 self-driving). The key performance indicator should be system performance not situational awareness. Having \"operators\" permanently installed in a control room when no action is required 99.9% of the time becomes a superficial level of vigilance. Take system administration as a corollary. System administrator's primary responsibility is to maintain the availability of infrastructure, but their primary tasking is not to sit idly by and actively monitor."

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of cyber threats, including zero-day exploits, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, poses unprecedented risks to modern network infrastructures. Conventional defense mechanisms, while effective in certain contexts, are reactive and often dependent on human intervention, which limits their ability to mitigate fast-moving and adaptive attacks. This increasing complexity highlights the urgent need for intelligent, autonomous solutions capable of securing digital ecosystems while ensuring continuity of operations. This paper introduces a self-healing AI-driven network architecture designed to detect, contain, and recover from cyber threats in real time. At a broad level, the system integrates machine learning–based anomaly detection with automated root cause analysis to identify malicious behaviors with precision. Building on this foundation, the architecture deploys adaptive routing mechanisms and autonomous remediation protocols that dynamically reconfigure network pathways, isolate compromised nodes, and restore system integrity without requiring prolonged human oversight. By leveraging continuous learning, the model enhances its resilience over time, improving its ability to anticipate and counter novel attack strategies. Applied to scenarios involving zero-day exploits, ransomware, and large-scale DDoS events, the proposed framework demonstrates its ability to minimize downtime, prevent cascading failures, and maintain critical service delivery. Narrowing the focus, the system highlights the transformative role of self-healing mechanisms in reducing operational costs, strengthening organizational resilience, and setting new benchmarks for proactive cybersecurity. Ultimately, the work emphasizes that AI’s role is not limited to detection but extends to full-cycle recovery, positioning self-healing architectures as a cornerstone of next-generation secure networks."

      "abstract": "With the rapid acceleration of urbanization, the scale of urban distribution networks has experienced significant growth. However, the prevalence of issues related to cable equipment quality disparities, inadequate construction process oversight, unfavorable operating conditions, and other factors has led to a pronounced increase in safety concerns for both individuals and the grid resulting from cable failures. Furthermore, the limitations of conventional online monitoring methods have posed considerable challenges in meeting the monitoring demands of widely distributed and large-scale urban distribution networks. To address these multifaceted challenges, this paper introduces the design of a low-power wireless online monitoring system grounded in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. This system is adept at concurrently monitoring multiple status signals within urban distribution networks. The proposed methodology entails the establishment of a monitoring sensing network for distribution networks, built upon IoT principles. It encompasses the optimization of low-power hardware circuitry, power management strategies, data communication protocols, and software control mechanisms, among other facets. Through the aforementioned research endeavors, the successful realization of a low-power design and application of IoT-based distributed monitoring systems for multiple signals within power distribution networks has been achieved. This accomplishment serves as a robust technical foundation for ensuring the dependable operation of urban power distribution networks."

      "abstract": "Data exfiltration remains a critical cybersecurity threat, particularly in edge computing environments where vast amounts of sensitive information are processed and transmitted. Traditional security mechanisms often struggle to detect sophisticated data breaches due to their reliance on predefined rules and signatures. This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for real-time detection of data exfiltration, leveraging transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures to analyze network traffic patterns and identify malicious activities. The transformer-based model demonstrated superior performance, achieving a detection accuracy of 96.3%, with lower false positive and false negative rates compared to CNN and RNN models. The proposed solution effectively minimizes alert fatigue by reducing false positives while ensuring high recall rates to detect unauthorized data transfers with minimal oversight. Additionally, the model's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained edge computing environments. Experimental results highlight the robustness of the approach against adversarial evasion techniques, emphasizing its potential for real-world cybersecurity applications. The study also explores the integration of continuous learning mechanisms and explainable AI to enhance model adaptability and interpretability. These findings suggest that deep learning-based detection methods can significantly improve data security in edge computing, providing a scalable and effective solution to mitigate data exfiltration threats in dynamic and distributed environments."

      "abstract": "This paper examines the transformative potential of Generative AI (GenAI) agents in functional testing for cloud-native applications. While effective, traditional quality assurance approaches often create significant engineering overhead and scalability challenges in distributed systems. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) through agentic workflows presents a novel paradigm that automates test generation, maintenance, and execution across multiple testing layers. Through the analysis of architectural frameworks, implementation methodologies, and organizational impacts findings indicate substantial improvements in both efficiency metrics and operational agility. The transformation of quality assurance roles from tactical execution to strategic oversight represents a fundamental shift in how enterprise-scale quality assurance can be conducted, suggesting that GenAI-driven testing approaches offer not merely technical optimization but a strategic competitive advantage in modern software development environments. Furthermore, the cross-domain applicability of these technologies surpasses conventional testing borders into adjacent quality issues including security validation, performance optimization, and user experience assurance, therefore providing a cohesive quality framework that tackles the whole spectrum of cloud-native application concerns while allowing hitherto unheard of scalability in quality operations suited to the rising complexity of dispersed architectures."

School principals' greater emphasis on academics than on sports indicates lax administrative control over coordination and the full implementation of educational curricula throughout the school year. The study recommended that administrative oversight be activated by the Educational Supervision Directorate to continuously monitor physical education lessons. School principals should also pay attention to the psychological and professional conditions of physical education teachers to maintain their commitment to their profession."

      "abstract": "The rapid development of complex digital environments has increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and as a result, there is a need to incorporate sophisticated processes for risk prioritization. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a game-changer, an instrument that not only provides unknown speed, scale, and precision in determining and prioritizing threats of possible harm. This paper discusses how AI can be applied to enhance risk prioritization in cybersecurity, its advantages and risks, governance requirements, and explores the future implications. Based on recent studies dating back to mid-2024, it focuses on predictive analytics models, end-to-end automated security systems, and autonomous risk management systems that encompass Security Operations Centers (SOC), Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) operations, and cloud protection. Despite the ability of AI to mitigate risk proactively through the use of predictive modeling, AI has vulnerabilities that may lead to harm, which could take the form of adversarial attacks, data poisoning, or misfortunes resulting from overreliance. The article, which was recently published, emphasizes measures such as ethical governance, transparency, human oversight, and adherence to industry principles, including ISO 42001 and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. It examines emergent technologies, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning, distributed threat intelligence systems, and the emerging predictive/preemptive means of addressing cybersecurity. As the process of AI integration into the existing security systems and the dynamics of the human-AI harmonious balancing have taken place, the ability of companies to be safe in the face of an accelerated change in cyber threats will increase. The conclusion highlights that AI has to augment human knowledge and has to be used as a force multiplier not a replacement and good governance is the key to safe and successful engagement. After all, the ability allowed by AI to prioritize risks has the potential not only to put the whole sphere of cybersecurity into a completely new realm, as reactive rather than predictive, but also enable businesses to better protect their more multi-faceted online environments."

      "abstract": "Cloud computing enables data storage and application deployment over the internet, offering benefits such as mobility, resource pooling, and scalability. However, it also presents major challenges, particularly in managing shared resources, ensuring data security, and controlling distributed applications in the absence of centralized oversight. One key issue is data duplication, which leads to inefficient storage, increased costs, and potential privacy and security risks. To address these challenges, this study proposes a post-quantum mechanism that enhances both cloud security and deduplication efficiency. The proposed SALIGP method leverages Genetic Programming and a Geometric Approach, integrating Bloom Filters for efficient duplication detection. The Cryptographic Deduplication Authentication Scheme (CDAS) is introduced, which utilizes blockchain technology to securely store and retrieve files, while ensuring that encrypted access is limited to authorized users. This dual-layered approach effectively resolves the issue of redundant data in dynamic, distributed cloud environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computation and communication times at various network nodes, particularly in key generation and group operations. Encrypting user data prior to outsourcing ensures enhanced privacy protection during the deduplication process. Overall, the proposed system leads to substantial improvements in cloud data security, reliability, and storage efficiency, offering a scalable and secure framework for modern cloud computing environments."

      "abstract": "This article examines the integration of blockchain technology and smart contracts within financial regulatory systems and their potential to transform traditional compliance frameworks. The distributed and immutable nature of blockchain presents unique opportunities for enhancing regulatory reporting, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring in financial institutions. Through analysis of implementation cases and theoretical frameworks, this article identifies key applications in automated reconciliation, real-time monitoring, and cross-border regulatory coordination. Despite promising benefits in transparency and automation, significant challenges persist in scalability, legacy system integration, and regulatory uncertainty. This article contributes to the growing body of literature on regulatory technology by providing a comprehensive examination of blockchain applications in financial oversight, offering insights for both regulatory bodies and financial institutions navigating this technological transition. The articles suggest that while blockchain implementation requires substantial infrastructure adaptation, its potential to create more efficient, transparent, and secure regulatory systems warrants continued exploration and development."

      "abstract": "A previous PRCI project (PR-015-084510, 2009) identified distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and acoustic emissions as potentially viable technologies for the detection of small leaks in liquid pipelines. Much of the assessment that led to this conclusion was based upon manufacturer-generated literature. However, there is a lack of existing, publicly-available test data on these technologies as they relate to detecting small leaks in liquid pipelines. Such data are needed by pipeline operators in order to determine the value in supplementing their existing leak detection systems with one of these technologies. The long-term goal of the PRCI team providing oversight to this work is to conduct full-scale field testing of these technologies. However, it is first important to determine the parameters that affect performance in order to design the large-scale testing and to identify conditions for which the technologies are not suitable. A project encompassing analysis and laboratory testing of DTS systems and modeling of acoustic emissions systems was conducted. \n\nIncludes some analysis of different liquids including crude oil, propane, gasoline, and carbon dioxide."

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients. However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\\%$ and up to $20\\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning environments."

      "abstract": "The increasing scale, speed, and sophistication of cyber threats have outpaced traditional, human-centered security operations, prompting the development of self-learning autonomous cyber defense agents. These AI-empowered entities leverage machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, and adaptive decision-making to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real time without direct human intervention. By continuously monitoring diverse data streams such as network traffic, endpoint telemetry, and system logs these agents dynamically update their threat models, enabling rapid adaptation to evolving attack patterns, including zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Unlike rule-based systems, self-learning agents refine their performance through iterative feedback loops, allowing for proactive threat hunting, predictive risk assessment, and autonomous mitigation actions such as traffic filtering, process isolation, or automated patch deployment. However, their deployment introduces complex operational, technical, and ethical challenges, including model drift, adversarial manipulation, explainability limitations, and potential overreach in automated decision-making. Integration into security operations centers (SOCs) requires robust orchestration with existing SIEM/SOAR platforms, real-time situational awareness, and human-in-the-loop oversight for high-impact actions to maintain accountability and compliance. The architecture of such agents often incorporates multi-agent systems for coordinated defense, enabling distributed detection and response across hybrid and cloud-native infrastructures. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the design principles, learning mechanisms, and operational workflows underpinning self-learning autonomous cyber defense agents, alongside a discussion of performance metrics such as detection accuracy, false positive rates, time-to-mitigation, and adaptability to emerging threats. It further examines governance frameworks and regulatory considerations to ensure ethical deployment, resilience against adversarial AI attacks, and alignment with organizational risk appetites. By uniting adaptive AI with automated security orchestration, self-learning cyber defense agents represent a transformative leap in cyber resilience, offering the potential to outpace threat actors while reducing analyst workload and improving incident response efficiency. Yet, realizing their full potential demands careful balancing of autonomy, transparency, and human oversight to sustain operational trust and strategic control in AI-driven cybersecurity ecosystems. \n Keywords: Self-Learning, Autonomous Agents, Cyber Defense, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Security Operations, Threat Detection, Incident Response, Zero-Day Exploits, Advanced Persistent Threats, SIEM, SOAR, Explainable AI, Cyber Resilience."

      "abstract": "Background The unprecedented scientific response to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in 2020 required the rapid development and activation of extensive clinical trial networks to study vaccines and therapeutics. The COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) coordinated hundreds of sites conducting phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of vaccines and antibody therapeutics. To facilitate these clinical trials, the CoVPN Volunteer Screening Registry (VSR) was created to collect volunteer information at scale, identify volunteers at risk of COVID-19 who met enrollment criteria, distribute candidates across clinical trial sites, and enable monitoring of volunteering and enrollment progress. Methods We developed a secure database to support three primary web-based interfaces: a national volunteer questionnaire intake form, a clinical trial site portal, and an Administrative Portal. The Site Portal supported filters based on volunteer attributes, visual analytics, enrollment status tracking, geographic search, and clinical risk prediction. The Administrative Portal supported oversight and development with pre-specified reports aggregated by geography, trial, and trial site; charts of volunteer rates over time; volunteer risk score calculation; and dynamic, user-defined reports. Findings Over 650,000 volunteers joined the VSR, and 1094 users were trained to utilize the system. The VSR played a key role in recruitment for the Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Novavax vaccine clinical trials, provided support to the Pfizer and Sanofi vaccine and prophylactic antibody clinical trials, and enhanced the diversity of trial participants. Clinical trial sites selected 166,729 volunteer records for follow-up screening, and of these 47·7% represented groups prioritized for increased enrollment. Despite the unprecedented urgency of its development, the system maintained 99·99% uptime. Interpretation The success of the VSR demonstrates that information tools can be rapidly yet safely developed through a public-private partnership and integrated into a distributed and accelerated clinical trial setting. We further summarize the requirements, design, and development of the system, and discuss lessons learned for future pandemic preparedness."

      "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative decoupling grid-forming (GFM) control strategy for utility-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) within weak distribution networks. Traditional control methods often fall short in providing effective frequency (f) and voltage (V) regulation primarily due to their device-centric design and reliance on P-f and Q-V droop mechanisms. These mechanisms, while suitable for inductive transmission systems, overlook the resistive nature of weak distribution grids. Consequently, this oversight results in significant active power (P) and reactive power (Q) coupling, which degrades dynamic performance and stability. To address this challenge, the proposed model adopts a systematic perspective, meticulously considering the coupling dynamics within the distribution grid. Through rigorous MATLAB and OPAL-RT simulations, this paper demonstrates the ability of the proposed control scheme to achieve precise P and Q decoupling. This enables DERs to offer accurate, autonomous f and V control, significantly improving grid stability and response. This work represents a substantial advancement in GFM control technology, addressing critical limitations in existing practices."

      "abstract": "This systematic review investigates the transformative potential of blockchain technology in enhancing Public Financial Management (PFM) and improving accountability in international aid distribution. By examining peer-reviewed articles, policy papers, and technical reports published between 2015 and 2023, the review synthesizes existing knowledge on how distributed ledger systems can address long-standing challenges in financial transparency, corruption, and inefficiency in global aid mechanisms. The study explores various blockchain use cases including smart contracts for automating fund disbursement, tokenization for traceable transactions, and decentralized auditing for real-time oversight. Findings reveal that blockchain’s immutability, transparency, and decentralized nature contribute significantly to minimizing aid leakage, improving donor-recipient trust, and reinforcing compliance with international reporting standards. Case studies from countries implementing blockchain-enabled solutions—such as UNDP’s pilot programs and World Food Programme’s Building Blocks—demonstrate promising outcomes, including cost reduction, improved beneficiary verification, and streamlined operations. However, the review also identifies notable barriers to large-scale adoption, such as technical complexity, regulatory uncertainty, limited digital infrastructure in low-income regions, and stakeholder resistance due to unfamiliarity with the technology. This paper applies the PRISMA framework to ensure rigorous data extraction and critical appraisal of the included literature. The synthesis highlights three core themes: (1) transparency enhancement through real-time tracking, (2) fraud prevention via immutable records, and (3) administrative efficiency gained through automation. The review emphasizes the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration, capacity building, and regulatory harmonization to enable effective blockchain integration into PFM systems and aid supply chains. Conclusively, blockchain holds transformative potential for global accountability frameworks, particularly in fragile economies where trust in financial governance is often low. The study calls for further empirical research, sandbox testing, and adaptive policy frameworks to assess long-term viability and impact. By leveraging distributed ledger technologies, international aid agencies and governments can foster a more transparent, efficient, and equitable financial ecosystem."

      "abstract": "Autonomous agents in cloud computing represent a transformative evolution beyond traditional automation approaches, enabling self-directed management of complex application environments. This article explores the architectural framework, implementation patterns, and operational benefits of Agentic AI in cloud-based application management. Unlike conventional automation systems constrained by static rules and predetermined workflows, autonomous agents leverage advanced machine learning techniques to perceive environmental conditions, learn from interactions, and take independent actions aligned with organizational objectives. The architectural foundation integrates sensing, reasoning, action, and feedback layers to create cognitive systems capable of addressing the inherent complexity of modern distributed applications. Key implementation patterns examined include intelligent auto-remediation, proactive capacity management, autonomous patch management, and continuous compliance enforcement—each demonstrating distinctive operational advantages across diverse industry contexts. Benefits include significant operational efficiency improvements, cost optimization through intelligent resource management, enhanced risk mitigation through proactive security measures, and scalability advantages in multi-cloud environments. The article addresses technical challenges related to decision boundaries and explainability, organizational considerations including skills gaps and operational model transformation, and governance requirements for responsible autonomous operations. Mitigation strategies incorporate phased implementation approaches, comprehensive explainability frameworks, and appropriate human oversight models to ensure effective and responsible deployment."

      "abstract": "As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution, asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable, decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments. We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation. To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models (LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second, GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems. By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage, GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them."

      "abstract": "Contemporary enterprise data systems encounter extraordinary obstacles when sustaining Extract, Transform, and Load operations throughout diverse data repositories. Schema modifications constitute a continuing challenge within modern data engineering, as changing organizational requirements constantly alter structural data configurations. Traditional schema change management methods depend extensively on manual processes, creating bottlenecks that delay critical business operations. This investigation introduces an innovative metadata-driven ETL framework addressing these obstacles through automated schema evolution detection and intelligent impact evaluation. The framework utilizes schema repositories and version monitoring systems to sustain detailed metadata catalogs, facilitating immediate identification of structural modifications throughout data repositories. The structural framework consists of four essential elements: Schema Registry Service, Change Detection Engine, Impact Analysis Module, and Pipeline Orchestration Layer. The implementation employs microservices design patterns operating on Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service, incorporating Apache Spark for expandable data processing and Delta Lake for dependable data storage. Extensive testing throughout enterprise settings reveals outstanding results in automated schema change resolution, demonstrating considerable achievement rates for automatic management of schema drift situations without requiring manual oversight. The framework exhibits superior scalability characteristics through distributed architectural principles, enabling horizontal scaling across multiple processing nodes while maintaining sub-second response times for schema change identification and impact evaluation."

      "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) offers many possibilities by using language models such as ChatGPT, also known as a synthetic generative intelligence chatbot advanced by OpenAI (OpenAI, Inc., San Francisco, USA). Using the potential of AI in medicine can provide a crucial tool to assess medical expertise and create a promising future in the field of medical education. Prior investigations have documented the progressive advancing performance of AI systems in addressing medical situations. These studies were also conducted in the evaluation of Polish medical examinations, comprising the State Specialization Examination (PES) as discussed in this article. These findings have stimulated scholarly debate regarding the potential of such technologies to serve as instruments for enhancing postgraduate specialist education and training. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the ChatGPT-4o model in solving the PES in the field of vascular surgery. The analysis examined both the correctness of the answers and the model’s stated confidence, with the goal of understanding its potential value in education. Methods This study was developed using the official PES in vascular surgery from a previous session, namely, the Spring 2025 edition, comprising 120 multiple-choice items. The ChatGPT-4o model was acquainted with the examination regulations beforehand, and all items were presented in the Polish language. Response accuracy was evaluated against the database of correct answers of the Medical Examination Center (CEM) in Łódź and also included the model’s self-reported confidence rating on a five-point scale. Statistical analyses were conducted using the chi-square test to compare categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test to assess differences between non-normally distributed continuous variables. Results ChatGPT-4o achieved 88 correct answers (73.3%), thereby surpassing the minimum passing criterion for the examination. There was no apparent distinction in the efficacy of clinical and non-clinical questions (p=0.561). The model's self-reported confidence levels did not largely correlate with its response accuracy. Such discrepancies show that, while ChatGPT can imply its doubts, it is not able to consistently predict performance, highlighting ongoing limitations in the model’s self-assessment capabilities. Conclusions ChatGPT-4o demonstrated satisfactory results on the PES vascular surgery exam, highlighting AI’s promise in specialist education, particularly as a support for learning a special field of medicine with specific conditions. It is crucial to treat ChatGPT as a supporting educational tool, not exclusively used by one source of knowledge. These findings indicate that advanced AI models may serve as valuable tools in a specialist field of education. Nonetheless, careful oversight by medical professionals and additional validation studies across various medical fields are necessary before AI models can be widely implemented in medical education."

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe eMERGE (electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics) Network is an NHGRI-supported consortium of five institutions to explore the utility of DNA repositories coupled to Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems for advancing discovery in genome science. eMERGE also includes a special emphasis on the ethical, legal and social issues related to these endeavors.OrganizationThe five sites are supported by an Administrative Coordinating Center. Setting of network goals is initiated by working groups: (1) Genomics, (2) Informatics, and (3) Consent & Community Consultation, which also includes active participation by investigators outside the eMERGE funded sites, and (4) Return of Results Oversight Committee. The Steering Committee, comprised of site PIs and representatives and NHGRI staff, meet three times per year, once per year with the External Scientific Panel.Current progressThe primary site-specific phenotypes for which samples have undergone genome-wide association study (GWAS) genotyping are cataract and HDL, dementia, electrocardiographic QRS duration, peripheral arterial disease, and type 2 diabetes. A GWAS is also being undertaken for resistant hypertension in ≈2,000 additional samples identified across the network sites, to be added to data available for samples already genotyped. Funded by ARRA supplements, secondary phenotypes have been added at all sites to leverage the genotyping data, and hypothyroidism is being analyzed as a cross-network phenotype. Results are being posted in dbGaP. Other key eMERGE activities include evaluation of the issues associated with cross-site deployment of common algorithms to identify cases and controls in EMRs, data privacy of genomic and clinically-derived data, developing approaches for large-scale meta-analysis of GWAS data across five sites, and a community consultation and consent initiative at each site.Future activitiesPlans are underway to expand the network in diversity of populations and incorporation of GWAS findings into clinical care.SummaryBy combining advanced clinical informatics, genome science, and community consultation, eMERGE represents a first step in the development of data-driven approaches to incorporate genomic information into routine healthcare delivery."

      "abstract": "Background Significant efforts have been made to develop artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for health care improvement. Despite the enthusiasm, health care professionals still struggle to implement AI in their daily practice. Objective This paper aims to identify the implementation frameworks used to understand the application of AI in health care practice. Methods A scoping review was conducted using the Cochrane, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases to identify publications that reported frameworks, models, and theories concerning AI implementation in health care. This review focused on studies published in English and investigating AI implementation in health care since 2000. A total of 2541 unique publications were retrieved from the databases and screened on titles and abstracts by 2 independent reviewers. Selected articles were thematically analyzed against the Nilsen taxonomy of implementation frameworks, and the Greenhalgh framework for the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) of health care technologies. Results In total, 7 articles met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, and 2 articles included formal frameworks that directly addressed AI implementation, whereas the other articles provided limited descriptions of elements influencing implementation. Collectively, the 7 articles identified elements that aligned with all the NASSS domains, but no single article comprehensively considered the factors known to influence technology implementation. New domains were identified, including dependency on data input and existing processes, shared decision-making, the role of human oversight, and ethics of population impact and inequality, suggesting that existing frameworks do not fully consider the unique needs of AI implementation. Conclusions This literature review demonstrates that understanding how to implement AI in health care practice is still in its early stages of development. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to provide the knowledge necessary to develop implementation frameworks to guide the future implementation of AI in clinical practice and highlight the opportunity to draw on existing knowledge from the field of implementation science."

      "abstract": "Unconventional shale gas development promises to significantly alter energy portfolios and economies around the world. It also poses a variety of environmental risks, particularly with respect to the management of water resources. We review current scientific understanding of risks associated with the following: water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing; wastewater treatment, discharge and disposal; methane and fluid migration in the subsurface; and spills and erosion at the surface. Some of these risks are relatively unique to shale gas development, while others are variations of risks that we already face from a variety of industries and activities. All of these risks depend largely on the pace and scale of development that occurs within a particular region. We focus on the United States, where the shale gas boom has been on-going for several years, paying particular attention to the Marcellus Shale, where a majority of peer-reviewed study has taken place. Governments, regulatory agencies, industry, and other stakeholders are challenged with responding to these risks, and we discuss policies and practices that have been adopted or considered by these various groups. Adaptive Management, a structured framework for addressing complex environmental issues, is discussed as a way to reduce polarization of important discussions on risk, and to more formally engage science in policy-making, along with other economic, social and value considerations. Data suggests that some risks can be substantially reduced through policy and best practice, but also that significant uncertainty persists regarding other risks. We suggest that monitoring and data collection related to water resource risks be established as part of planning for shale gas development before activity begins, and that resources are allocated to provide for appropriate oversight at various levels of governance."

      "abstract": "Partnership between the private sector and the ocean observing community brings exciting opportunities to address observing challenges through leveraging the unique strengths of each sector. Here, we discuss a case study of a successful relationship between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and Saildrone to instrument an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) in order to serve shared goals. This case study demonstrates that a private company working with a federal laboratory has provided innovative ocean observing solutions deployed at regional scale in only a few years, and we project that this model will be sustainable over the long-term. An alignment of long-term goals with practical deliverables during the development process and integrating group cultures were key to success. To date, this effort has expanded NOAA’s interdisciplinary observing capabilities, improved public access to ocean data, and paved the way for a growing range of USV applications in every ocean. By emphasizing shared needs, complementary strengths, and a clear vision for a sustainable future observing system, we believe that this case study can serve as a blueprint for public and private partners who wish to improve observational capacity. We recommend that the international scientific community continue to foster collaborations between the private sector and regional ocean observing networks. This effort could include regional workshops that build community confidence through independent oversight of data quality. We also recommend that an international framework should be created to organize public and private partners in the atmospheric and oceanographic fields. This body would coordinate development of observational technologies that adhere to best practices and standards for sensor integration, verification, data quality control and delivery, and provide guidance for unmanned vehicle providers. Last, we also recommend building bridges between the private sector, ocean observing community, and the operational forecast community to consider the future of this new private sector, with goals to determine targeted ocean observing needs; assess the appropriateness of USVs as science platforms, sensors, and data format standards; and establish usage and data quality control and distribution protocols for ocean observing and operational forecasting."

      "abstract": "Importance\nOptimal health care delivery, both now and in the future, requires a continuous loop of knowledge generation, dissemination, and uptake on how best to provide care, not just determining what interventions work but also how best to ensure they are provided to those who need them. The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is the most rigorous instrument to determine what works in health care. However, major issues with both the clinical trials enterprise and the lack of integration of clinical trials with health care delivery compromise medicine's ability to best serve society.\n\n\nObservations\nIn most resource-rich countries, the clinical trials and health care delivery enterprises function as separate entities, with siloed goals, infrastructure, and incentives. Consequently, RCTs are often poorly relevant and responsive to the needs of patients and those responsible for care delivery. At the same time, health care delivery systems are often disengaged from clinical trials and fail to rapidly incorporate knowledge generated from RCTs into practice. Though longstanding, these issues are more pressing given the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of poor access to optimal care on vulnerable populations, and the unprecedented opportunity for improvement offered by the digital revolution in health care. Four major areas must be improved. First, especially in the US, greater clarity is required to ensure appropriate regulation and oversight of implementation science, quality improvement, embedded clinical trials, and learning health systems. Second, greater adoption is required of study designs that improve statistical and logistical efficiency and lower the burden on participants and clinicians, allowing trials to be smarter, safer, and faster. Third, RCTs could be considerably more responsive and efficient if they were better integrated with electronic health records. However, this advance first requires greater adoption of standards and processes designed to ensure health data are adequately reliable and accurate and capable of being transferred responsibly and efficiently across platforms and organizations. Fourth, tackling the problems described above requires alignment of stakeholders in the clinical trials and health care delivery enterprises through financial and nonfinancial incentives, which could be enabled by new legislation. Solutions exist for each of these problems, and there are examples of success for each, but there is a failure to implement at adequate scale.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThe gulf between current care and that which could be delivered has arguably never been wider. A key contributor is that the 2 limbs of knowledge generation and implementation-the clinical trials and health care delivery enterprises-operate as a house divided. Better integration of these 2 worlds is key to accelerated improvement in health care delivery."

      "abstract": "Adiposity is a major cause of death and disability (1, 2). Recent reports suggest that 0.6 billion adults would be classified as obese (defined as a body mass index [BMI] 30 kg/m2) and 1.3 billion as overweight (defined as a BMI of 25 to <30 kg/m2) according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. A meta-analysis of prospective studies, mostly in high-income countries, of 4 million never-smokers without chronic disease who survived more than 5 years after BMI was measured found that each 5-kg/m2 increase in BMI above 25 kg/m2 was associated with 31% higher all-cause mortality and 42% higher cardiovascular mortality (3). Since most of those studies were completed, however, the prevalence of obesity has increased in many countries, whereas vascular mortality has decreased. Further, the associations of BMI with mortality may be different in populations with substantially higher mean BMI than those originally studied or in particular ethnic groups (4). Another meta-analysis that was restricted to Asian countries found that among 0.7 million never-smokers who had survived more than 3 years, above a BMI of 25 kg/m2, further increases in BMI were associated with substantially higher mortality in East Asians but not in South Asians (5). Similarly, a recent study in South India among 0.4 million adults without previous disease who had survived longer than 2 years found that BMI was approximately unrelated to vascular mortality (6). Two recent analyses of prospective studies in Hispanic adults found no association between overweight or obesity and higher all-cause mortality, although both studies were relatively small (17000 and 39000 participants, respectively) (7, 8). Moreover, neither study allowed for the possible effect of reverse causality (whereby low BMI may be a consequence as well as a cause of disease). Studies limiting the effects of reverse causality are needed to clarify the causal relevance of overweight and obesity to mortality in Hispanic populations, and to investigate whether, given BMI, indices of abdominal obesity, such as waist-to-hip ratio, have substantial further relevance to mortality. We report the associations between general and abdominal adiposity and all-cause and cause-specific mortality during a 14-year follow-up of 150000 adults who participated in the Mexico City Prospective Study between 1998 and 2004 (9). Methods Recruitment and Study Oversight Adults aged 35 years or older who were residents of 2 Mexico City districts between 1998 and 2004 were invited to participate in this prospective study. We recorded age, sex, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors (such as smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity), current medications, and medical history. Calibrated electronic scales, stadiometers, and nonstretchable tape were used to measure weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg), height (to the nearest 0.1 cm), and waist and hip circumference (also to the nearest 0.1 cm), respectively. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Blood pressure was measured with the participant seated. A 10-mL blood sample was collected from each participant. Plasma and buffy coat samples were sent to Oxford (United Kingdom) for long-term storage over liquid nitrogen. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured in buffy coat samples by using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method (10). Study Population The main analyses excluded participants with an HbA1c level of 7% or higher at recruitment and those with previous diagnoses of diabetes, renal disease, vascular disease, cancer, liver cirrhosis, or emphysema. Participants who had missing or extreme values for any anthropometry measure (Table 1 footnote) (1.4% of otherwise eligible participants), had missing or implausible covariate data (Statistical Analysis section) (0.1% of otherwise eligible participants), were aged 90 years or older at recruitment, or had uncertain vital status at the end of follow-up (0.8% of otherwise eligible participants) were also excluded. Table 1. Characteristics of 115400 Participants Aged 35 to <75 Years at Recruitment, by Sex and BMI Mortality Follow-up Mortality was tracked up to 1 January 2016 through probabilistic linkage to the Mexican electronic death registry, which has a high standard of quality and completeness (11). Field validation of more than 7000 matched deaths confirmed the reliability of the matching process in more than 95% of cases. The registry encodes all diseases mentioned on the death certificate according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (12). Study clinicians reviewed and, if necessary, recoded the underlying cause of death (for example, accepting diabetes as the underlying cause only for deaths due to acute diabetic crises) (13). Statistical Analysis The statistical methods are described in detail in the Supplement. Initially, BMI was grouped into 5 WHO-defined categories: normal (18.5 to <25 kg/m2), overweight (25 to <30 kg/m2), obesity grade 1 (30 to <35 kg/m2), obesity grade 2 (35 to <40 kg/m2), and obesity grade 3 (40 to 60 kg/m2), excluding the few participants outside the BMI range of 18.5 to 60 kg/m2. However, because nearly two thirds of the cohort was classified as normal or overweight, these 2 categories were subdivided, yielding 7 categories: 18.5 to <22.5 kg/m2, 22.5 to <25 kg/m2 (the reference group), 25 to <27.5 kg/m2, 27.5 to <30 kg/m2, 30 to <35 kg/m2, 35 to <40 kg/m2, and 40 to 60 kg/m2. For comparability with the BMI analyses, waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference were each subdivided into 7 categories that were prevalence matched to the 7 BMI categories, again with the second group as the reference. Supplement. Supplementary Material To limit the effects of reverse causality, the main analyses excluded participants with certain previous diseases and those who died within 5 years of recruitment. For these analyses, the remaining deaths and follow-up were divided into 5-year age-at-risk ranges, that is, the age ranges in which those deaths occurred during follow-up. The main analyses included deaths that occurred at ages 40 to <75 years (defined as premature deaths). A secondary analysis was of deaths that occurred at ages 75 to <90 years. Cox regression, stratified by 5-year age-at-risk groups, was used to assess the relevance of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist circumference (in each of the 7 groups described earlier) to mortality. The hazard ratio (HR) was estimated for each exposure group after 1 of these groups was designated as the reference, with an HR of 1. The variance of the log risk in each group, including the reference, was calculated (from the variances and covariances of the log HRs in all groups except the reference group) and used to obtain group-specific 95% CIs (14). Participants who did not die were censored at the end of the risk period under consideration (for example, on their 75th birthday for analyses of deaths occurring at ages 40 to <75 years) or at the end of follow-up (1 January 2016). In analyses of cause-specific mortality (Supplement Table 1), participants whose cause of death differed from the one being analyzed were censored at their date of death. All Cox regression analyses were adjusted for sex, district of residence (1 of 2 districts), self-reported highest education level attained (university or college, high school, elementary school, other), leisure-time physical activity (none, up to twice weekly, at least 3 times weekly), smoking status (never, former, current but not daily, daily [<10 cigarettes per day], daily [10 cigarettes per day]), and alcohol intake (none, former use, current use). Subsequent analyses included BMI as a continuous variable, with HRs estimated for 5-kg/m2 increases in BMI. With the same adjustment for covariates as described earlier, these HRs were estimated separately for participants with a BMI <25 kg/m2 and those with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or greater. All-cause mortality HRs associated with BMI also were estimated separately for deaths occurring 5 to <10 years and those occurring 10 years or more after recruitment. Other sensitivity analyses involved the following: exclusion of current or former smokers, exclusion of anyone with an HbA1c concentration of 6.5% to <7%, inclusion of those with previously diagnosed diabetes but good glycemic control (defined as an HbA1c level <7%), and fitting the household of each participant as a random effect (to allow for any clustering). Analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute); Stata, version 13.1 (StataCorp); and R, version 3.5.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing; www.r-project.org). Study Oversight Research ethics approval was obtained from the Mexican Health Ministry, Mexican National Council of Science and Technology, and University of Oxford (United Kingdom). All participants provided written informed consent. Role of the Funding Source The funding sources had no role in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Results Participants Of 112333 eligible households visited, 106059 (94%) yielded a total of 159755 participants. Of these, 8907 were excluded because they were aged 90 years or older at recruitment or had a history of chronic disease other than diabetes. Another 4795 participants were excluded because they had extreme, uncertain, or missing exposure; covariate; or mortality outcome data (including 623 with a BMI <18.5 kg/m2 and 30 with a BMI >60 kg/m2). The remaining 146053 participants included 19068 with previously diagnosed diabetes and 4888 others with an HbA1c concentration of 7% or higher at recruitment. Both groups were excluded from the main analyses, leaving 122097 participants: 115400 aged 35 to <75 years and 6697 aged 75 to <90 years at recruitment. Adiposity and Other Baseline Characteristics Among the 115400 participants aged 35 to <75 years, mean baseline BMI was 28.0 kg/m2 ("

      "abstract": "Recent advances in genomic and post-genomic technologies have now established the new standard in medical and biotechnological research. The introduction of next-generation sequencing, NGS,has resulted in the generation of thousands of genomes from all domains of life, including the genomes of complex uncultured microbial communities revealed through metagenomics. Although the application of genomics to marine biodiversity remains poorly developed overall, some noteworthy progress has been made in recent years. The genomes of various model marine organisms have been published and a few more are underway. In addition, the recent large-scale analysis of marine microbes, along with transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to the study of teleost fishes, mollusks and crustaceans, to mention a few, has provided a better understanding of phenotypic variability and functional genomics. The past few years have also seen advances in applications relevant to marine aquaculture and fisheries. In this review we introduce several examples of recent discoveries and progress made towards engendering genomic resources aimed at enhancing our understanding of marine biodiversity and promoting the development of aquaculture. Finally, we discuss the need for auspicious science policies to address challenges confronting smaller nations in the appropriate oversight of this growing domain as they strive to guarantee food security and conservation of their natural resources."

      "abstract": "This article represents a call to action for the mindfulness field to be more diverse and inclusive of Latinx individuals. Building a diverse and inclusive science around mindfulness-based approaches (MBAs) that considers important group-level cultural and contextual information is an important public health challenge in need of innovative solutions. We describe ways that the Latinx population is poised to benefit from MBAs. We further elucidate challenges, describe potential solutions, and outline a research agenda that may hold promise for building a more inclusive mindfulness movement. Our recommendations center around developing nuanced cultural adaptations to MBAs, engaging Latinx individuals in research, increasing the rigor of scientific studies pertaining to Latinx individuals, relying on implementation science to develop innovative methods for disseminating MBAs to Latinx individuals, developing training and certification mechanisms to increase diversity and representation of Latinx mindfulness teachers, and creating mechanisms for the oversight of MBAs within this group. There has been a lack of inclusivity of Latinx individuals in the field of MBAs with regards to research studies, barriers to access for economically disadvantaged groups, and lack of diversity in its workforce. Considering the recognition of adverse social drivers of health that generate chronic stress and health disparities, the Latinx population is especially poised to benefit greatly from MBAs. A diverse and inclusive mindfulness science holds promise to enhance the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and wide-scale dissemination and implementation of MBAs."

      "abstract": "The recent integration of visual capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs) has the potential to play a pivotal role in science and technology education, where visual elements such as diagrams, charts, and tables are commonly used to improve the learning experience. This study investigates the performance of ChatGPT-4 Vision, OpenAI’s most advanced visual model at the time the study was conducted, on the Bachelor in Computer Science section of Brazil’s 2021 National Undergraduate Exam (ENADE). By presenting the model with the exam’s open and multiple-choice questions in their original image format and allowing for reassessment in response to differing answer keys, we were able to evaluate the model’s reasoning and self-reflecting capabilities in a large-scale academic assessment involving textual and visual content. ChatGPT-4 Vision significantly outperformed the average exam participant, positioning itself within the top 10 best score percentile. While it excelled in questions that incorporated visual elements, it also encountered challenges with question interpretation, logical reasoning, and visual acuity. A positive correlation between the model’s performance in multiple-choice questions and the performance distribution of the human participants suggests multimodal LLMs can provide a useful tool for question testing and refinement. However, the involvement of an independent expert panel to review cases of disagreement between the model and the answer key revealed some poorly constructed questions containing vague or ambiguous statements, calling attention to the critical need for improved question design in future exams. Our findings suggest that while ChatGPT-4 Vision shows promise in multimodal academic evaluations, human oversight remains crucial for verifying the model’s accuracy and ensuring the fairness of high-stakes educational exams. The paper’s research materials are publicly available at https://github.com/nabormendonca/gpt-4v-enade-cs-2021."

      "abstract": "Ethical and regulatory oversight of research animals is focused on vertebrates and rarely includes invertebrates. Our aim was to undertake the first study to describe differences in public confidence, trust, and expectations for the oversight of scientists using animals in research. Participants were presented with one of four treatments using a 2 by 2 design; terrestrial (T; mice and grasshoppers) vs. aquatic (A; zebrafish and sea stars) and vertebrates (V; mice and zebrafish) vs. invertebrates (I; grasshoppers and sea stars). A representative sample of census-matched Canadian participants ( n  = 959) stated their confidence in oversight, trust in scientists and expectation of oversight for invertebrates on a 7-point Likert scale. Participants’ open-ended text reasoning for confidence and expectations of oversight were subjected to thematic analysis. Participants believed invertebrates should receive some level of oversight but at two-thirds of that currently afforded to vertebrates. Four primary themes emerged to explain participant expectation: (1) value of life, (2) animal experience, (3) participant reflection, and (4) oversight system centered. Confidence in oversight was highest for TV (mean ± SE; 4.5 ± 0.08) and AV (4.4 ± 0.08), less for TI (3.8 ± 0.10), and least for AI (3.5 ± 0.08), indicating the absence of oversight decreased public confidence. Four themes emerged to explain participant confidence, centered on: (1) animals, (2) participant reflection, (3) oversight system, and (4) science. Trust in scientists was similar for TV (4.3 ± 0.07) and AV (4.2 ± 0.07), but higher for TV compared to TI (4.1 ± 0.07) and TV and AV compared to AI (4.0 ± 0.06); absence of oversight decreased public trust in scientists. These results, provide the first evidence that the public believe invertebrates should receive some level of oversight if used for scientific experiments. The gap that exists between current and public expectations for the oversight of invertebrates may threaten the social licence to conduct scientific research on these animals."

      "abstract": "Background:High mother-to-child HIV transmission rates in Nigeria are coupled with a critical shortage of trained health personnel, dearth of infrastructure, and low levels of male involvement in HIV care. This study evaluated maternal and provider satisfaction with services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission within the context of an implementation science cluster-randomized trial that included task shifting to lower-cadre workers, male engagement, point-of-care CD4+ cell counts, and integrated mother–infant care. Methods:Patient and clinician satisfaction were measured at 6 control and 6 intervention sites using a 5-point Likert scale. Patient satisfaction was assessed at 6 weeks postpartum through a 22-item scale about the provider's ability to explain the health problem, time spent with the clinician, and motivation to follow prescribed treatment. Provider satisfaction was assessed through a 12-item scale about motivation, compensation, and training, with 4 additional questions about the impact of task shifting on job satisfaction to intervention arm providers. Results:We measured satisfaction among 340 mothers (intervention n = 160; control n = 180) and 60 providers (intervention n = 36; control n = 24). Total patient satisfaction (maximum 5) was higher in the intervention than control arm [median (interquartile range) = 4.61 (4.22–4.79) vs. 3.84 (3.22–4.22), respectively; P < 0.001]. Provider satisfaction was generally high, and was similar between the intervention and the control arms [median (interquartile range) = 3.60 (3.37–3.91) vs. 3.50 (3.08–4.25), respectively; P = 0.69]. Provider satisfaction dropped when questions on newly acquired provider roles were included [3.47 (3.25–3.72)]. Patient and provider satisfaction were not associated with uptake of antiretroviral therapy or mother–infant retention at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum. Conclusions:Satisfaction was higher among patients at intervention sites, and provider satisfaction decreased when newly assigned roles were factored in. Task shifting should include training and supportive oversight to ensure comfort with assigned tasks."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the issues of openness and transparency of the budgeting process in the defense and security sector in Ukraine, which results in effective spending of budgets.After Russia started a full-scale war against Ukraine, the international community is providing Ukraine with numerous financial support packages and ammunition. Therefore, one of the most important issues is strengthening the democratic control over the budget process in the defense and security sector of Ukraine, taking into account the new principles of information openness and its classification as a state secret. Here, the need to develop standards for transparent budgeting and the introduction of an open indicative system for monitoring and evaluating the budget process in the defense and security sector is particularly relevant.The article provides an empirical description, uses data obtained from expert discussions and multidimensional evaluation approaches on openness and transparency of the budget process in the defense and security sector to enhance the effectiveness of military budget spending.The paper develops conceptual approaches to ensuring the efficient use of budgetary resources in the defense and security sector by generalizing the practical implementation of the open and transparent budgeting principles, development of effective mechanisms for budget oversight, and compliance with standards of public accountability.The paper focuses on the need for the implementation of budget transparency standards referring to the priorities of the Military Security Strategy of Ukraine with particular attention to the issues of openness and transparency of financial reporting at budgetary institutions. The study proves the prospects for the introduction of transparent budgeting standards in the defense and security sector, which is a fundamentally new approach able to strengthen corruption prevention and, in combination with other hybrid defense tactics, the military provision.The study is performed under the project “Openness and transparency of budgeting in the defense and security sector of Ukraine”, supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine."

      "abstract": "Background Prevention of suicide is a global health priority. Approximately 800,000 individuals die by suicide yearly, and for every suicide death, there are another 20 estimated suicide attempts. Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to enhance scalable, accessible, and affordable digital services for suicide prevention and self-harm interventions. However, their use also raises clinical and ethical questions that require careful consideration. Objective This scoping review aims to identify emergent trends in LLM applications in the field of suicide prevention and self-harm research. In addition, it summarizes key clinical and ethical considerations relevant to this nascent area of research. Methods Searches were conducted in 4 databases (PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) in February 2024. Eligible studies described the application of LLMs for suicide or self-harm prevention, detection, or management. English-language peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings were included, without date restrictions. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesize study characteristics, objectives, models, data sources, proposed clinical applications, and ethical considerations. This review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) standards. Results Of the 533 studies identified, 36 (6.8%) met the inclusion criteria. An additional 7 studies were identified through citation chaining, resulting in 43 studies for review. The studies showed a bifurcation of publication fields, with varying publication norms between computer science and mental health. While most of the studies (33/43, 77%) focused on identifying suicide risk, newer applications leveraging generative functions (eg, support, education, and training) are emerging. Social media was the most common source of LLM training data. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was the predominant model used, although generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) featured prominently in generative applications. Clinical LLM applications were reported in 60% (26/43) of the studies, often for suicide risk detection or as clinical assistance tools. Ethical considerations were reported in 33% (14/43) of the studies, with privacy, confidentiality, and consent strongly represented. Conclusions This evolving research area, bridging computer science and mental health, demands a multidisciplinary approach. While open access models and datasets will likely shape the field of suicide prevention, documenting their limitations and potential biases is crucial. High-quality training data are essential for refining these models and mitigating unwanted biases. Policies that address ethical concerns—particularly those related to privacy and security when using social media data—are imperative. Limitations include high variability across disciplines in how LLMs and study methodology are reported. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence signals a shift in approach, particularly in applications related to care, support, and education, such as improved crisis care and gatekeeper training methods, clinician copilot models, and improved educational practices. Ongoing human oversight—through human-in-the-loop testing or expert external validation—is essential for responsible development and use.

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children, originates from a multifaceted interplay of genetic, neurological, and environmental factors. Recent studies have increasingly concentrated on environmental determinants, notably air pollution, and their impact on the risk of developing ADHD. Additionally, previous research has often conflated clinically diagnosed ADHD cases with instances of mere ADHD-like symptoms, a methodology that can introduce bias and obscure the true relationship between environmental factors and ADHD. To address this oversight, our systematic review meticulously investigates the relationship between both prenatal and postnatal exposures to particular air pollutants and strictly clinically diagnosed ADHD. Our comprehensive review encompassed 801 studies from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases, out of which eight met our rigorous inclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was utilized to gauge quality and bias. Our review found substantiated the connection between prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and NOx and a heightened risk of ADHD, while exposure to PM10 during the prenatal stage was not associated with ADHD. These findings hint at varied health impacts from different particulate matters and the prospect of gender-specific susceptibilities to such exposures. We also identified an association between postnatal exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 and an increased ADHD risk, underlining the potential neurodevelopmental harms from early exposure to these pollutants. These relationships, seemingly intricate and potentially dose-dependent, underscore the need for more detailed scrutiny. The unique value of our review is in its detailed exploration of the association between specific air pollution exposures and clinically diagnosed ADHD. Our findings offer much-needed clarity in this complex domain and emphasize the importance of future research to standardize exposure and outcome metrics, probe potential mechanisms, and reduce bias and heterogeneity."

      "abstract": "In this paper, it was critically discussed the consequences of having a proper Internal Audit Function together with the good corporate governance mechanism in the business organizations. These consequences were included to safeguard the interest of the shareholders towards the business organization. Introduction The incidences of the corporate scandals and global financial crisis in recent years has brought forward the concept of corporate governance and received growing attention from the regulators and public. The large-scale corporate failures and major accounting scandals such as WorldCom and Enron have reduced public confidence on the reliability and independency of accounting and auditing profession as well as the reputation of the financial markets. The regulatory and professional bodies have response to these scenarios by introducing several act, regulations and new standards as to govern the actions taken by the respective professions and organizations. One of the focus that emphasized by the regulatory is to increase the demand and awareness for internal assurance on corporate governance processes, which includes risk management and internal control in each organizations or companies. This has been done by increasing disclosure requirements that is pertaining with corporate governance and well placed of internal audit function as an essential element of the corporate governance’s assurance. Moreover, an increase of awareness and courtesy on the function, roles and establishment of internal audit in a growing number of organizations have been experiential over recent years. A number of recent studies have stated the importance and significant of the internal audit function for regulatory reforms and its ability to add value concerning quality corporate governance, through its oversight role, its enhancements to the monitor and controlling environment and its potential to detect and mitigate fraud risk. In other word, internal audit function should be maintained to provide International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 12, Dec, 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 718 the management and audit committee with ongoing assessments of the company’s system of internal control and risk management processes. It is claimed that the firm is in healthier position when it is equipped with an effective and efficient internal audit function that add value to services (Ridley & D’ Silva, 2007). In addition, in contributing the improvement of governance, the internal audit activity’s objectives comprise ensuring effective management’s accountability and performance, promoting right ethics and values, administrating risk and control information, and shared information between the management, board, internal and external auditors. The management, board, internal and external auditors are four interrelated pillars in an organization’s governance process. To succeed, each pillar must be effective and must work together to support the organization’s objectives and strategies with ethics and integrity. Ineffectiveness of these pillars will lead to the failure of organization’s governance such as what happen to Enron where each pillars was not effective and both internal auditors and external auditors were from the same firm. The objectives of the study is (1) to provide understandings on the current roles and responsibilities of the internal audit function and the necessary factors perceived in order to ensure its effectiveness; (2) to identify a relationship between internal audit function and corporate governance; and (3) to discuss on the internal audit function’s contribution towards a high quality of corporate governance process. Corporate Governance Corporate governance is a broad concept that has been used by regulators, investors, accountants, and boards of directors. Levitt (1999) defined corporate governance as “the link between a company’s management, directors, and its financial reporting system. Besides, Monks and Minow (2001) defined corporate governance as the “relationship among various participants in determining the direction and performance of corporations”. Whereas, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) defined governance as “processes deal with the procedures utilized by the representatives of the organization’s stakeholders to provide oversight of risk and control processes administered by management. The monitoring of organizational risks and the assurance that controls adequately mitigate those risks both contribute directly to the achievement of organizational goals and the preservation of organizational value. Those performing governance activities are accountable to the organization’s stakeholders for effective stewardship”. More lately, Roe (2004) defines corporate governance as the relationships at the top of the firm (the board of directors, the senior managers, and the stockholders). Based on his opinion, the institutions of corporate governance are those recurrent mechanisms that assign authority among the three that that effect in controlling the decisions made at the top of the firm. In short, corporate governance shows an idea of objectives communication, incentives, control and monitoring (Staciokas & Rupsys, 2005). The development of corporate governance rules and guidelines is happened due to the increases in corporate fraud, high profile corporate failures, and unethical business practices that caused by the growing lack of trust in directors. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 12, Dec, 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 719 Internal Audit Function The internal audit function plays a unique role in the governance process. Internal audit is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization’s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes (Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), 2009). Management often requests internal auditors to help provide them with assurance that organizational processes are controlled effectively and efficiently and risks are identified and monitored effectively. The internal audit’s unique role makes it often depicted as the “eyes and ears of management”. Thus, internal auditors have to face conflict in assisting management to assess the effectiveness and efficiencies of their governance processes whereas reporting to the audit committee on the tone at the top. Figure 1 indicates substantial differences in functions and required skills in serving audit committee needs, as opposed in fulfilling the needs of management. Management requires the internal auditor to serve both assurance and consulting, addressing risks, evaluate the efficiency of operations, and stimulate organizational action. In contrast, the audit committee is more attentive in assurance concerning controls. The internal audit function has advanced in many organizations to a leadership position in facilitating the organization in implementing, assessing, or conceptualizing risk management and control processes within an organization. In other words, internal audit has performed an active role in executing effective corporate governance and in assessing effective management’s control practices. Through the provision of effective support to the management, internal audit constitutes an important element of the company’s internal corporate governance (Freidank & Pasternack, 2011; Sarens & Abdolmohammadi, 2011). In this respect, if a quality assessment of internal audit activities can be made; internal audit function might be viewed as an intangible asset for an organization. Figure 1: Competing Demands on Internal Audit Function (Sources: Hermanson & Rittenberg, 2003) International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 8 , No. 12, Dec, 2018, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2018 HRMARS 720 Internal Audit Function and Corporate Governance In the past 50 years, organizations in the private, public service and voluntary sectors have recognized internal auditing functions to provide assurance and improve their monitoring activities. At this time, most internal audit work pertained to internal accounting control and assets’ security. Shortly after 1942, IIA were established worldwide to promote professionalism for internal auditing. The main aim at the time was to encourage internal auditors worldwide to meet and share their experiences in auditing. During this time, Mints (1972) stated that internal auditing relationships classified into three broad groups, which is traditional (protection, compliance), current moderate approach (constructive and protective, problem-solving) and participative teamwork approach (providing assistance in achieving organization objectives, working with management). Later, many research continues to form the internal auditors’ behavior in the services they deliver and the professional guidance provided by the IIA. Whereas, the governance developments started since Cadbury (1992) and supported both the significance of evaluating the controls’ effectiveness and the significance of reviewing the requirement for internal auditing in a company. Then, there is existence of legal requirements for internal auditing for some time but these requirements are only focused on compliance and safeguarding of assets, and not for the services relating assurance and advice on risk management, control and governance issues. By 1999, the IIA with affiliated chapters and national institutes in many countries had developed into a global organization. IIA has revised its internal auditing’s definition, re-emphasizing its important roles in risk management, control and for the first time it mentioned its roles in governance processes.

      "abstract": "Digital health promises to increase intervention reach and effectiveness for a range of behavioral health outcomes. Behavioral scientists have a unique opportunity to infuse their expertise in all phases of a digital health intervention, from design to implementation. The aim of this study was to assess behavioral scientists' interests and needs with respect to digital health endeavors, as well as gather expert insight into the role of behavioral science in the evolution of digital health. The study used a two-phased approach: (a) a survey of behavioral scientists' current needs and interests with respect to digital health endeavors (n = 346); (b) a series of interviews with digital health stakeholders for their expert insight on the evolution of the health field (n = 15). In terms of current needs and interests, the large majority of surveyed behavioral scientists (77%) already participate in digital health projects, and from those who have not done so yet, the majority (65%) reported intending to do so in the future. In terms of the expected evolution of the digital health field, interviewed stakeholders anticipated a number of changes, from overall landscape changes through evolving models of reimbursement to more significant oversight and regulations. These findings provide a timely insight into behavioral scientists' current needs, barriers, and attitudes toward the use of technology in health care and public health. Results might also highlight the areas where behavioral scientists can leverage their expertise to both enhance digital health's potential to improve health, as well as to prevent the potential unintended consequences that can emerge from scaling the use of technology in health care."

      "abstract": "Background Ghana significantly reduced maternal and newborn mortality between 1990 and 2015, largely through efforts focused on improving access to care. Yet achieving further progress requires improving the quality and timeliness of care. Beginning in 2013, Ghana Health Service and Kybele, a US-based non-governmental organization, developed an innovative obstetric triage system to help midwives assess, diagnosis, and determine appropriate care plans more quickly and accurately. In 2019, efforts began to scale this successful intervention into six additional hospitals. This protocol describes the theory-based implementation approach guiding scale-up and presents the proposed mixed-methods evaluation plan. Methods An implementation theory was developed to describe how complementary implementation strategies would be bundled into a multi-level implementation approach. Drawing on the Interactive Systems Framework and Evidenced Based System for Implementation Support, the proposed implementation approach is designed to help individual facilities develop implementation capacity and also build a learning network across facilities to support the implementation of evidence-based interventions. A convergent design mixed methods approach will be used to evaluate implementation with relevant data drawn from tailored assessments, routinely collected process and quality monitoring data, textual analysis of relevant documents and WhatsApp group messages, and key informant interviews. Implementation outcomes of interest are acceptability, adoption, and sustainability. Discussion The past decade has seen a rapid growth in the development of frameworks, models, and theories of implementation, yet there remains little guidance on how to use these to operationalize implementation practice. This study proposes one method for using implementation theory, paired with other kinds of mid-level and program theory, to guide the replication and evaluation of a clinical intervention in a complex, real-world setting. The results of this study should help to provide evidence of how implementation theory can be used to help close the “know-do” gap. Plain language summary Every woman and every newborn deserves a safe and positive birth experience. Yet in many parts of the world, this goal is often more aspiration than reality. In 2006, Kybele, a US-based non-governmental organization, began working with the Ghanaian government to improve the quality of obstetric and newborn care in a large hospital in Greater Accra. One successful program was the development of a triage system that would help midwives rapidly assess pregnant women to determine who needed what kind of care and develop risk-based care plans. The program was then replicated in another large hospital in the Greater Accra region, where a systematic theory to inform triage implementation was developed. This paper describes the extension of this approach to scale-up the triage program implementation in six additional hospitals. The scale-up is guided by a multi-level theory that extends the facility level theory to include cross-facility learning networks and oversight by the health system. We explain the process of theory development to implement interventions and demonstrate how these require the combination of local contextual knowledge with evidence from the implementation science literature. We also describe our approach for evaluating the theory to assess its effectiveness in achieving key implementation outcomes. This paper provides an example of how to use implementation theories to guide the development and evaluation of complex programs in real-world settings."

      "abstract": "Though citizen science programs have been broadly successful in diverse scientific fields, their adoption has lagged in some disciplines, including soil science and ecosystem ecology. Collaborations with citizen scientists may be viewed as a conundrum in these disciplines, which often require substantial labor and technical experience; citizen scientists could improve sampling capacity but may reduce sample quality or require training and oversight prior to and while performing specialized tasks. To demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating citizen scientists into soil biogeochemistry research, we conducted a proof-of-concept study in high-elevation meadows of the Sierra Nevada in California. A collaboration between university researchers and citizen scientists allowed us to assess spatial and diel patterns of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes with an intensity and frequency that would otherwise be beyond the capacity of a typical research laboratory. This collaboration with citizen scientists increased our sampling intensity by over 700% while only doubling the sampling error relative to that of full-time researchers. With training and support from project scientists, citizen scientists collected data that demonstrate spatial independence of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide at scales between 1 m and 175 m. Additionally, we found a lack of temporal variation over a 24-h period for all three GHGs. Citizen scientists participating in this one-day event reported levels of satisfaction commensurate with longer-term, immersive campaigns. The place-based event also proved an effective tool for teaching intangible concepts of soil biogeochemistry and promoting local conservation. Despite perceived barriers to entry, this study demonstrates the mutual benefits of citizen science collaborations in soil science and ecosystem ecology, encouraging adoption by disciplines that have been slow to take advantage of such collaborations. Short-term, local citizen science events can provide meaningful experiences for area residents and teach global biogeochemical cycles in a place-based context."

Following PRISMA guidelines, studies were selected from Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed databases. The analysis shows that LLMPAA has been widely applied in reading comprehension, language education, and computer science, primarily using essay and short-answer formats. While models such as GPT-4 and fine-tuned BERT often exhibit high agreement with human raters (e.g., QWK = 0.99, r = 0.95), other studies report lower agreement (e.g., ICC = 0.45, r = 0.38). LLMPAA offers benefits like efficiency, scalability, and personalized feedback. However, significant challenges remain, including bias, inconsistency, hallucination, limited explainability, dataset quality, and privacy concerns. These findings indicate that while LLMPAA technologies hold promise, their effectiveness varies by context. Human oversight is essential to ensure fair and reliable assessment outcomes."

      "abstract": "Background: In recent years, there has been remarkable growth in AI-based applications in healthcare, with a significant breakthrough marked by the launch of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. Patients and health professional students commonly utilize these models due to their accessibility. The increasing use of LLMs in healthcare necessitates an evaluation of their ability to generate accurate and reliable responses. Objective: This study assessed the performance of LLMs in answering orthodontic-related queries through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted up to 31 October 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), and R Studio software (Version 4.4.0) was employed for meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessment. Results: Out of 278 retrieved articles, 10 studies were included. The most commonly used LLM was ChatGPT (10/10, 100% of papers), followed by Google’s Bard/Gemini (3/10, 30% of papers), and Microsoft’s Bing/Copilot AI (2/10, 20% of papers). Accuracy was primarily evaluated using Likert scales, while the DISCERN tool was frequently applied for reliability assessment. The meta-analysis indicated that the LLMs, such as ChatGPT-4 and other models, do not significantly differ in generating responses to queries related to the specialty of orthodontics. The forest plot revealed a Standard Mean Deviation of 0.01 [CI: 0.42–0.44]. No heterogeneity was observed between the experimental group (ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini, and Copilot) and the control group (ChatGPT-4). However, most studies exhibited a high PROBAST risk of bias due to the lack of standardized evaluation tools. Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 has been extensively used for a variety of tasks and has demonstrated advanced and encouraging outcomes compared to other LLMs, and thus can be regarded as a valuable tool for enhancing educational and learning experiences. While LLMs can generate comprehensive responses, their reliability is compromised by the absence of peer-reviewed references, necessitating expert oversight in healthcare applications."

      "abstract": "BackgroundEastern temperate and boreal forests of North America contain declining populations of several migratory bird species. Breeding season habitat loss and degradation, and lack of structural complexity, have been proposed as potential drivers of declines. Forest management has moved toward balancing multiple age classes to support sustainable harvest and meet the needs of wildlife associated with different forest types, structural conditions, and landscape configurations. Extensive research on forest bird species-environment relationships has occurred in direct reference to, and outside of, this management context. In this systematic map, we propose to answer the review question: what evidence exists for bird species-environment relationships in eastern temperate and boreal forests of North America? The map will outline the available science for developing spatially-explicit forest management plans to benefit multiple bird species at regional scales. A global review recently found little evidence to support either positive or negative effects of systematic conservation planning on real-world management systems. This result was driven by the widespread absence of measureable criteria to evaluate plan performance and pervasive disconnects between conservation planners and management program evaluators. Successful evaluation of forest management requires, at minimum, the specification of metrics that clearly relate vegetation attributes (predictors) to bird-related outcomes (responses). This systematic map should aid in the selection of evaluation metrics that can be used across the entire planning-implementation-evaluation cycle to: (1) characterize baseline conditions, (2) specify target conditions, (3) and evaluate progress toward achieving targets.MethodsThis protocol describes methods to search for, identify, screen, and extract meta-data from primary research studies that report on bird species-environment relationships in eastern temperate and boreal forests of North America. Searches will be conducted using bibliographic databases and grey literature sources suggested by a technical oversight team comprised of practicing foresters and land managers. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be specified to identify articles containing relevant information for meta-data extraction. Meta-data will be extracted from all eligible studies, summarized in a narrative systematic map report, and made available online as a searchable geodatabase."

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, \n \nLast year, two research teams led by Dr Yoshihiro Kawaoka (University of Wisconsin at Madison) and Dr Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) generated avian influenza virus H5N1 variants that acquired the ability to transmit via aerosols between ferrets.1 Their papers were submitted to Nature and Science for publication. However, such studies are considered by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) as ‘dual use research', a biological research with legitimate scientific purpose that may be misused to pose a biologic threat to public health and/or national security (http://oba.od.nih.gov/biosecurity/biosecurity.html). In December 2011, the panel recommended publication of the main conclusions of the work, but without the experimental details and mutation data to prevent others from replicating the experiments.2 \n \nThis decision sparked an intense public debate on the benefits and potential harm of this type of research. Many scientists have believed that publication of the experimental details would allow the researchers in the field to further determine how influenza viruses in nature become human pandemic threats and how to contain these viruses before they acquire the ability of human-to-human transmission. Those against such publication have argued that this information would be too dangerous to be made public based on its potential threat to biosecurity. \n \nThen, early this year, the NSABB undertook a careful re-evaluation of the Kawaoka/Fouchier's work using appropriate analytical tools to determine the risks and benefits associated with the communication of dual use research of concern. The panel reversed course on 29–30 March 2012, and recommended full publication of the two revised manuscripts (http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/breaking-news-nsabb-reverses-pos.html) and the papers were finally published in Nature3 and Science4 recently. \n \nAs scientists, we welcome NSABB's decision because the findings will substantially benefit other researchers to establish virus mutation monitoring systems and to develop strategies for preventing H5N1 pandemic in the future. We have recently analyzed the conservation rate of the four key residues in H5 HA reported in Imai's Nature paper and found that three of the four residues are highly conservative (N158: 69.31%; N224: 99.64%; Q226: 99.9%; and T318: 99.95%). But some of the man-made mutations, such as N158D, N224K and T318I, are indeed present in the viruses in their nature hosts (gb:{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JN807780\",\"term_id\":\"353249969\",\"term_text\":\"JN807780\"}}JN807780/duck/Egypt/10185SS; {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY585366\",\"term_id\":\"47156286\",\"term_text\":\"AY585366\"}}AY585366|A/duck/ Guangxi) as described by Russell et al.5 Particularly, the strain {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JN807780\",\"term_id\":\"353249969\",\"term_text\":\"JN807780\"}}JN807780 was isolated from the ducks in Egypt. Since it contains both N158D and N224K mutations, this strain has a great potential to gain its transmissibility in humans. Therefore, a special attention should be given to the monitoring of this H5N1 variant. \n \nMore importantly, the debate surrounding this event has awakened research scientists to the cogent issues involving biosecurity and biosafety in research on emerging infectious pathogens. The United Nations and the World Health Organization have long been aware of the potential to create biological weapons in the researches on infectious pathogens. The resolution of WHA 26.54 of the Twentieth World Health Assembly in 1967 clearly states that ‘scientific achievements, and particularly in the field of biology and medicine—that most humane science—should be used only for mankind's benefit, but never to do it any harm' (http://www.who.int/csr/delibepidemics/biochem1stenglish/en/index.html). \n \nBiosecurity is the strategic and integrated approach to protect human health, economy and environment from negative impacts. Particularly, it is a set of preventive measures for reducing the risk of transmission of infectious diseases and use of active methods to avert biological terrorism or other disease outbreaks.6 The objective of biosecurity is to prevent loss, theft or misuse of microorganisms, biological materials and research-related information (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5). Following these guidelines, research scientists should adhere to the highest bioethical standards during their experimental design and communication of the results. Similar to the NSABB, investigators should also use appropriate analytical tools to determine the risks and benefits associated with any contemplated dual use research on emerging infectious diseases, making every effort to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks in any such research. \n \nAlthough the NSABB has played an important role in providing advice, guidance and leadership regarding biosecurity oversight of dual use research, this advisory committee empaneled by the US Department of Health and Human Services has no direct authority over dual use research in other countries. Accordingly, we suggest that an advisory panel with a mission similar to that of the NSABB, designated Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (SABB), be formalized by each of other countries, which act at the national level to provide advice and guidance regarding biosecurity oversight of dual use research projects in their own countries. The model of the ‘International Clinical Trial Registration Platform' may be adapted for monitoring the projects of dual use research. This kind of projects should be registered through the SABB of the corresponding countries, with clear statements of the potential risks and benefits of their researches before the start of the projects. If a project with more risks than benefits, it should not be approved by the SABB. The results from this kind of research projects should not be allowed for publication if the projects have not been approved by SABB. Another benefit of pre-registration is to avoid the waste of research funds and resources. Each research institution and organization should perform regular evaluation on those pre-registered projects and require discontinuation of the projects at any stage if the results show that the risk is increasing. Biosafety includes ‘containment principles, facility design, practices and procedures to prevent occupational infections in the biomedical environment or release of the organisms to the environment'.6 These measures are designed to reduce laboratory-acquired infections to researchers handling infectious materials and other biologically hazardous materials. Strict adherence to biosafety procedures is absolutely essential for researchers working with emerging pathogens because the exact transmission pathways of these pathogens are unclear, and specific preventives and therapeutics are generally unavailable. It would only take a single mistake in handling infectious materials to cause a full-on disaster. One painful example of this occurred at Beijing's Institute of Virology where a lab researcher was infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in a sample that was improperly handled, resulting in the death of the researcher's mother and the infection of several others.7 Thus, researchers should be particularly careful in handling laboratory-generated organisms or mutant pathogens with increased transmissibility in humans since the regular protective procedures may not be effective for the new pathogens.8 Following suggestions are made for the researchers who are working on these new pathogens: (i) they must be well trained and proficient in handling such dangerous materials safely; (ii) they should make a detailed risk assessment under the direction of the Institutional Biosafety Committees consisting of biological safety professionals before starting to work on the infectious agents, analyze the worst case scenarios that may occur and prepare a strategy to mitigate the impact of the negative event if it happens; (iii) they should strictly follow the safety procedures and manage the research materials by adherence to appropriate materials management procedures; (iv) they should report to their supervisors or biosafety officials immediately if they encounter a dangerous situation or identify a new pathogen with significantly increased human transmissibility and/or virulence; and (v) they must establish material accountability procedures to track the inventory, storage, use, transfer and destruction of dangerous biological materials and assets when no longer needed (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5). \n \nFinally, we would like to point out that it is not necessary to be overcautious in handling some non-airborne microbes. For example, experiments using research-laboratory-scale quantities of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, a blood-borne virus, can be performed in a biosafety level-2, rather than biosafety level-3 facility (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety)."

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for mental health care, offering scalable support through their ability to generate human-like responses. However, the effectiveness of these models in clinical settings remains unclear. This scoping review aimed to assess the current generative applications of LLMs in mental health care, focusing on studies where these models were tested with human participants in real-world scenarios. A systematic search across APA PsycNet, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science identified 726 unique articles, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. These studies encompassed applications such as clinical assistance, counseling, therapy, and emotional support. However, the evaluation methods were often non-standardized, with most studies relying on ad hoc scales that limit comparability and robustness. Privacy, safety, and fairness were also frequently underexplored. Moreover, reliance on proprietary models, such as OpenAI's GPT series, raises concerns about transparency and reproducibility. While LLMs show potential in expanding mental health care access, especially in underserved areas, the current evidence does not fully support their use as standalone interventions. More rigorous, standardized evaluations and ethical oversight are needed to ensure these tools can be safely and effectively integrated into clinical practice."

      "abstract": "\n BACKGROUND\n Significant efforts have been made to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions for healthcare improvements. Despite the enthusiasm, healthcare professionals still struggle to implement AI in their daily practices.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n This paper aims to identify what implementation frameworks have been used to understand AI's application in healthcare practice.\n \n \n METHODS\n A scoping review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines using the Cochrane, EBM Reviews, Embase, Medline(R), and PsychInfo databases to identify publications that reported frameworks, models, and theories concerning AI implementation in healthcare. The review focused on studies published in English and investigating AI implementation in healthcare since 2000. A total of 2,541 unique publications were retrieved from the databases and screened on titles and abstracts by two independent reviewers. Selected articles were thematically analysed against Nilsen’s taxonomy of implementation frameworks, and Greenhalgh’s framework for the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) of healthcare technologies.\n \n \n RESULTS\n Seven articles met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. Two articles included formal frameworks that directly addressed AI implementation, and the other articles provided limited descriptions of elements influencing implementation. Collectively the seven articles identified elements that aligned with all of the NASSS domains, but no single article demonstrated comprehensive consideration of factors known to influence technology implementation. New domains were identified including dependency on data input and existing processes, shared decision making, the role of human oversight, and ethics of population impact and inequality, suggesting that existing frameworks do not fully consider the unique needs of AI implementation.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n This literature review demonstrates that understanding how to implement AI technology in healthcare practice is still in its early stages of development. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to provide the knowledge necessary to develop implementation frameworks to guide the future implementation of AI in clinical practice and highlight the opportunity to draw on existing knowledge from implementation science.\n"

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence scales, the concepts of alignment, agency, and autonomy have become central to AI safety, governance, and control. However, even in human contexts, these terms lack universal definitions, varying across disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, law, computer science, mathematics, and political science. This inconsistency complicates their application to AI, where differing interpretations lead to conflicting approaches in system design and regulation. This paper traces the historical, philosophical, and technical evolution of these concepts, emphasizing how their definitions influence AI development, deployment, and oversight. We argue that the urgency surrounding AI alignment and autonomy stems not only from technical advancements but also from the increasing deployment of AI in high-stakes decision making. Using Agentic AI as a case study, we examine the emergent properties of machine agency and autonomy, highlighting the risks of misalignment in real-world systems. Through an analysis of automation failures (Tesla Autopilot, Boeing 737 MAX), multi-agent coordination (Metas CICERO), and evolving AI architectures (DeepMinds AlphaZero, OpenAIs AutoGPT), we assess the governance and safety challenges posed by frontier AI."

An Executive Committee and 2 senior scientific liaisons work with VA and DOE leadership to optimize efforts in the service of shared scientific goals. The program supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including creation of a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. Cross-cutting methods including natural language processing, image processing, and reusable code were developed.\n\n\nResults\nThe 79.6 million dollar collaboration has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes and launched over 10 collaborative scientific projects in health conditions highly prevalent in veterans. A ground-breaking analysis on the Summit and Andes supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants which resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) including large language natural language processing and a system biology study focused on opioid addiction awarded the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease, and cross-cutting data science. Predictive models developed in these projects are being tested for application in clinical management.\n\n\nDiscussion\nEight new projects were launched in 2023, taking advantage of the momentum generated by the previous collaboration. A major challenge has been limitations in the scope of appropriated funds at DOE which cannot currently be used for health research.\n\n\nConclusion\nExtensive multidisciplinary interactions take time to establish and are essential to continued progress. New funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the ORNL and for supporting continued collaboration by joint VA-DOE research teams are needed."

      "abstract": "The study investigated the effects of corporate governance on delinquency management of microfinance banks in Nigeria with the aim to examine the impact of board size and board composition on delinquency management. The study applied Static panel regression estimate which involved pooled regression, fixed effect estimate, random effect estimate, Hausman test as the main estimation technique. Data on corporate governance (proxied by board size and board composition) and delinquency management (proxied by default rate) were obtained from Annual Financial Statement of respective microfinance banks over a period of seven (7) years from 2012 to 2018). The result revealed that board size has negative and significant effect on default rate and board composition has a negative and an insignificant effect on default rate. The result implies that bank managers should increase their board size with more management skills and professionalism, making it very difficult for the CEO to manipulate the board. The study concluded that corporate governance has negative effect on delinquency management of microfinance banks in Nigeria. The study recommended that management of microfinance banks should regulate the size of the board which should not be too large and must consist of highly skilled and competent professionals who are conversant with oversight function. Keyword: Corporate Governance, Credit Policies, Delinquency Management, Microfinance Bank, Nigeria. Introduction Corporate governance focuses on the way organisations are managed and controlled. This includes the best practices established and followed by organisations to ensure its operations are governed. Basically, corporate governance is the process that ensures how a firm is directed, controlled and held accountable. This involves interaction among stakeholders dealing with the organisation directly International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 0 , No. 5, May, 2020, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2020 HRMARS 440 or indirectly including employees, shareholders, creditors, subcontractors and long-term suppliers (Brownbridge, 2007; Ndumai, 2013). Aliu and Gakure (2014) opine that corporate governance involves a system by which financial institutions such as microfinance banks relate to their customers and stakeholders to improve their quality of life. Therefore, good corporate governance ensures transparency, accountability and fairness in financial transactions and reporting (Oyewole, Olusanmi & Owolabi, 2015). Corporate governance is not only limited to corporate efficiency, it also relates to a much wider range of microfinance banks’ strategies and life cycle development (Unegbu, 2004). Microfinance banks record negative experiences of failure around the globe in recent time which gives credence to the need for good and sound corporate governance practices (Oyewole et al, 2015). According to Fernando (2006), microfinance banks (MFBs) around the world witness several failures as a result of high incidence of non-performing loans, weak management and poor governance. Shleifer, Andrei and Vishny cited in Ndumai (2013) assert that the sheer scale of fraud, embezzlement and graft in some failed microfinance banks has brought into question the reliability and effectiveness of present-day operational and compliance control mechanism and financial reporting systems of microfinance banks. The impact of corporate governance on microfinance bank seems unequally dispersed among countries. Some microfinance banks have become very significant in size and serve a good number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) customers, like the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, or BRI in Indonesia, while other microfinance banks remain relatively small or even cease to exist (Cicea & Hincu, 2009). An important mechanism of governance is the quality of the board of directors. Accordingly, leadership characteristics of MFIs have great impact on their performance (Waithakam Gakure & Wanjau, 2013). The primary objective of every microfinance bank is to operate profitably in order to maintain its stability and improve performance and sustainability (Impact reporting and investment standards, 2010). However, existence of high levels of loan delinquency problem in microfinance industry in most countries negatively affects the level of services to SMEs (Ditcher, 2003). The governance of corporate microfinance bank plays a principal role in ensuring that the bank keeps to its mission of serving SMEs and other customers (Moauro & Spaggiari, 2011). Good corporate governance in microfinance banks is expected to underpin effective and efficient social performance within organisations (Waithakam et al, 2013). Good corporate governance promotes goodwill and confidence in the financial system. Studies show that good corporate governance leads to increased valuation, higher profit levels, increased sales growth and lower capital expenditure (Wolfgang, 2003). This view way supported by Lam, Tin and Lee (2008). The main objective of the study is to evaluate the extent to which corporate governance affects delinquency management of microfinance banks in Nigeria. Specifically, the study investigates: • the effects of board size on delinquency management of microfinance banks; • analyses the impact of board composition on delinquency management of microfinance banks in Nigeria. The other sections are divided into literature review, methodology, results and discussion as well as conclusion and recommendations. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 0 , No. 5, May, 2020, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2020 HRMARS 441 Literature Review Conceptual Clarifications Corporate Governance Alexandra, Reed, and Lajoux (2005) define corporate governance as the system by which companies are directed and controlled. The nature of corporate governance, therefore, going by this definition consists of two dimensions: direction and control. The direction dimension of corporate governance emphasises the responsibility of the board to attend to strategic positioning and planning in order to enhance the performance and sustainability of the company; while on the other hand, emphasises the responsibility of the board to oversee the executive management of the company in the execution of the plans and strategies. Sequel to the financial crisis in 2006 to 2007 witnessed all over the world especially in the banking sector, the issue of corporate governance has become an issue to talk about in both non academic settings and academic environment. Most studies have defined corporate governance in different ways especially as it concerns power of owners, managers and providers of capital (Solomon, 2010). The concept of corporate governance is viewed from two perspectives, namely, the narrow and broad perspectives. The narrow approach to corporate governance is viewed by Arun and Turner (2002) as the mechanism through which shareholders are assured that managers will act in their interest. Oyejide and Soyibo (2001) explain this narrow view of corporate governance as the relationship of the enterprise to shareholders. It is concerned with the structures within which a corporate entity or enterprise receives its basic orientation and direction. Shleifer and Vishny (1997) contend that corporate governance mainly deals with the ways in which the returns on investment of shareholders of an organisation are guaranteed. Similarly, Cadbury, Butler, Lipworth, Macdonald, Smith, Brown and Collum (1992) also narrowly describe corporate governance as an arrangement through which the affairs of shareholders are managed and controlled. Furthermore, Hart (1995) sees corporate governance as the interaction involving shareholders and the senior management of companies with board of directors acting as the mediator. According to Pandey (2006), corporate governance is a process that ensures responsibility, transparency and accountability functions of management in order to maximise shareholders wealth and take decisions to boost its financial performance. The broad view of corporate governance is concerned with the methods by which suppliers of finance control managers in order to ensure that their capital cannot be expropriated and that they earn a return on their investment. It views corporate governance as the relationship of the enterprise to society as a whole (Angahar & Mejabi, 2014). According to Oyejide and Soyibo, (2001), the broad perspective of corporate governance is described as being the heart of both a market economy and democratic society. Corporate governance entails incorporating the interest of stakeholders such as management, shareholders, customers, creditors, government and other stakeholders in the affairs of the organisation. In this regard, corporate governance is defined as a set of institutional arrangements for governing the interest of all the stakeholders who have contributed in one way or the other (Blair, 1995; Obasi & Nkwagu, 2017). Rogers (2008) opines that corporate governance is about building credibility, ensuring transparency and accountability as well as maintaining an effective channel of information disclosure that would foster good corporate performance. Roger (2008) further opines that it is about how to build trust and sustain confidence among the various interest groups that make up an organisation. Similarly, Salvioni, Gennari and Bosetti (2016) posit that corporate governance is a combination of structures and processes. While the structure refers to all the bodies responsible for the firm’s International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 0 , No. 5, May, 2020, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2020 HRMARS 442 direction and control, the processes consist in the activities developed to satisfy the stakeholders’ expectation. Corporate governance, therefore, specifies the ways by which corporations are directed and guarded. The structure of corporat"

      "abstract": "Private wells often lack centralized oversight, drinking water quality standards, and consistent testing methodologies. For lead in well water, the lack of standardized data collection methods can impact reported measurements, which can misinform health risks. Here, we conducted a targeted community science testing of 1143 wells across 17 counties in North Carolina (USA) and compared results to state testing data primarily associated with new well construction compiled in the NCWELL database. The goal of our study was to explore the impacts of sampling methodology and household representation on estimated lead exposures and subsequent health risks. At the household scale, we illustrated how sampling and analytical techniques impact lead measurements. The community science testing first draw samples (characterizing drinking water) had a 90th percentile lead value of 12.8 μg l−1 while the NCWELL database flushed samples (characterizing groundwater) had a value below the reporting level of 5 μg l−1. As lead was associated with the corrosion of premise plumbing, flushing prior to collection substantially reduced lead concentrations. At the community scale, we examined how the lack of representation based on household demographics and well construction characteristics impacted the knowledge of lead and blood lead level (BLL) occurrence. When simulating representative demographics of the well populations, we observed that the 90th percentile lead level could differ by up to 6 μg l−1, resulting in communities being above the USEPA action level. This translated to a 1.0–1.3 μg dl−1 difference in predicted geometric mean BLL among infants consuming reconstituted formula. Further, inclusion of less common well construction types also increased lead in water occurrence. Overall, under- and overestimations of lead concentrations associated with differences in sampling techniques and sample representation can misinform conclusions about risks of elevated BLLs associated with drinking water from private wells which may hinder investigations of waterborne lead exposure."

      "abstract": "T he educational program at the July 2017 Biotechnology Innovation Organization’s World Congress in Montreal included several panels on the rapidly evolving tool box in support of industrial biotechnology. One panel included representatives from many wellestablished names and early pioneers in synthetic biology (Twist Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA), protein engineering (Arzeda, Seattle, WA), biofoundries (Ginko Bioworks, Boston, MA) and CRISPR Cas9 (Estes Advisors) to discuss the new outsourced value chain that has emerged to assist especially smaller companies in their discovery and development efforts. Another panel—Performance Enzymes for Food Ingredients— discussed how the same tools are used by the enzyme industry in the discovery and development of enzymes tailored to new food applications and deployment of those enzymes in novel food applications. As members of the enzyme industry vary greatly in size AND in-house resources and capabilities, they rely to differing extents on the so-called outsourced value chain. Larger enzyme companies have established deep understanding and capabilities in protein engineering and the management of fermentation cell factories to develop and scale-up their process, but rely heavily on outsourced DNA sequencing and made-to-order synthetic DNA. Each of the Performance Enzymes panel speakers gave detailed presentations on their companies’ integrated suites of technical capabilities. Marc Struhalla discussed one-pot enzymatic synthesis of biomolecules by c-Lecta (Leipzig, Germany). Andrew Ellis of Biocatalysts (Cardiff, United Kingdom) discussed genome sequencing, protein engineering and highthroughput screening as put into practice by Biocatalysts, as did John Perkins (DSM, Parsippany, NJ) and Vince Sewalt (DuPont Industrial Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Chandrakant Rathi of Advanced Enzymes Technologies (Louiswadi, Thane, India) focused on his company’s efforts in application development for palm oil extraction, illustrating that biotechnology is directed toward solving very practical problems, anywhere in the world. The ensuing discussion led by panel moderator Vince Sewalt of DuPont focused on what panel members perceived to be the next bottlenecks in effective enzyme development and commercialization—including making sense of the abundance of sequence data and gene expression information, which will require Big Data capabilities. Another bottleneck identified for smaller companies was the development and continuous improvement of ‘‘cell factories’’ at full-scale fermentation volumes, a capability that today is limited to only the largest enzyme companies. In his introduction to the other speakers, Vince Sewalt also emphasized the need for additional commercialization capabilities that include safety assessment, regulatory approvals, and advocacy for science-based and risk-focused regulatory oversight, globally. In the discussion, it became abundantly clear that industry needs to collaborate in demonstrating product safety by using well-established safety evaluation methods. Such procedures focus on the safety of the production organism, in addition to addressing the enzyme, the manufacture process, supporting safety data, and a thorough exposure assessment (Fig. 1). Collectively, we can aid regulatory agencies in their assessment of our products by familiarizing them with the technology and the safety of the resulting food enzymes, which, if done in a consistent manner, results in knowledge-building among regulators. For example, the enzyme industry has produced numerous toxicology studies on enzymes from genetically engineered microbes (Pariza and Johnson), including for protein-engineered enzymes (as summarized by Pariza and Cook), and introduced the concept of Safe Strain Lineage to regulators. The latter builds on the repeated use of common production organism as our work horses, such as Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, and Trichoderma reesei, and the optimization of these lineages into socalled ‘‘cell factories.’’ The knowledge built over multiple years and even decades for these production organisms includes a rich database of safety data, which supports Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status of new enzymes when produced by members of a microbial lineage that has already been established as safe by repeated evaluation through standard, publicly recognized"

      "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the foremost cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have demonstrated substantial potential in augmenting risk stratification for primary prevention, surpassing conventional statistical models in predictive performance. Thus, integrating ML with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enables refined risk estimation by leveraging the granularity and breadth of longitudinal individual patient data. However, fundamental barriers persist, including limited generalizability, challenges in interpretability, and the absence of rigorous external validation, all of which impede widespread clinical deployment. Methods: This review adheres to the methodological rigor of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) guidelines. A systematic literature search was performed in March 2024, encompassing the Medline and Embase databases, to identify studies published since 2010. Supplementary references were retrieved from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science, and manual searches were curated. The selection process, conducted via Rayyan, focused on systematic and narrative reviews evaluating ML-driven models for long-term CVD risk prediction within primary prevention contexts utilizing EHR data. Studies investigating short-term prognostication, highly specific comorbid cohorts, or conventional models devoid of ML components were excluded. Results: Following an exhaustive screening of 1757 records, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 10 were systematic reviews (four incorporating meta-analyses), while 12 constituted narrative reviews, with the majority published post-2020. The synthesis underscores the superiority of ML in modeling intricate EHR-derived risk factors, facilitating precision-driven cardiovascular risk assessment. Nonetheless, salient challenges endure heterogeneity in CVD outcome definitions, undermine comparability, data incompleteness and inconsistency compromise model robustness, and a dearth of external validation constrains clinical translatability. Moreover, ethical and regulatory considerations, including algorithmic opacity, equity in predictive performance, and the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, pose formidable obstacles to seamless integration into clinical workflows. Conclusions: Despite the transformative potential of ML-based CVD risk prediction, it remains encumbered by methodological, technical, and regulatory impediments that hinder its full-scale adoption into real-world healthcare settings. This review underscores the imperative circumstances for standardized validation protocols, stringent regulatory oversight, and interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge the translational divide. Our findings established an integrative framework for developing, validating, and applying ML-based CVD risk prediction algorithms, addressing both clinical and technical dimensions. To further advance this field, we propose a standardized, transparent, and regulated EHR platform that facilitates fair model evaluation, reproducibility, and clinical translation by providing a high-quality, representative dataset with structured governance and benchmarking mechanisms. Meanwhile, future endeavors must prioritize enhancing model transparency, mitigating biases, and ensuring adaptability to heterogeneous clinical populations, fostering equitable and evidence-based implementation of ML-driven predictive analytics in cardiovascular medicine."

      "abstract": "Background: Microsurgery is a highly complex and technically demanding field within reconstructive surgery, with outcomes heavily dependent on meticulous planning, precision, and postoperative monitoring. Over the last five years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool across all phases of microsurgical care, offering new capabilities in imaging analysis, intraoperative decision support, and outcome prediction. Methods: A comprehensive narrative review was conducted to evaluate the peer-reviewed literature published between 2020 and May 2025. Multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched using combinations of controlled vocabulary and free-text terms relating to AI and microsurgery. Studies were included if they described AI applications during the preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative phases of microsurgical care in human subjects. Discussion: Using predictive models, AI demonstrated significant utility in preoperative planning through automated perforator mapping, flap design, and individualised risk stratification. AI-enhanced augmented reality and perfusion analysis tools improved precision intraoperatively, while innovative robotic platforms and intraoperative advisors showed early promise. Postoperatively, mobile-based deep learning applications enabled continuous flap monitoring with sensitivities exceeding 90%, and AI models accurately predicted surgical site infections, transfusion needs, and long-term outcomes. Despite these advances, most studies relied on retrospective single-centre data, and large-scale, prospective validation remains limited. Conclusions: AI is poised to enhance microsurgical precision, safety, and efficiency. However, its integration is challenged by data heterogeneity, generalisability concerns, and the need for human oversight in nuanced clinical scenarios. Standardised data collection and multicentre collaboration are vital for robust, equitable AI deployment. With careful validation and implementation, AI holds the potential to redefine microsurgical workflows and improve patient outcomes across diverse clinical settings."

This study examines the role of researchers as either ethical gatekeepers or pioneers of AI-driven change. Through a bibliometric analysis of 464 records from the Web of Science Core Collection, we identify key themes in ethical AI discourse using VOSviewer Version 1.6.20. The findings highlight dominant ethical concerns, including governance, bias, transparency, and fairness, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaborations and responsible AI frameworks. While AI offers efficiency and scalability in research, unresolved issues related to algorithmic bias, governance, and public trust persist. The overlay visualization underscores emerging trends such as generative AI, policy-driven governance, and ethical accountability frameworks. This study calls for a shift from passive oversight to proactive ethical stewardship in AI-driven social science research."

      "abstract": "Abstract The administrative burden of clinical documentation contributes to health care practitioner burnout and diverts valuable time away from direct patient care. Ambient artificial intelligence (AI) scribes—also called “digital scribes” or “AI scribes”—are emerging as a promising solution, given their potential to automate clinical note generation and reduce clinician workload, and those specifically built on a large language model (LLM) are emerging as technologies for facilitating real-time clinical documentation tasks. This potentially transformative development has a foundation on longer-standing, AI-based transcription software, which uses automated speech recognition and/or natural language processing. Recent studies have highlighted the potential impact of ambient AI scribes on clinician well-being, workflow efficiency, documentation quality, user experience, and patient interaction. So far, limited evidence indicates that ambient AI scribes are associated with reduced clinician burnout, lower cognitive task load, and significant time savings in documentation, particularly in after-hours electronic health record (EHR) work. One consistently reported benefit is the improvement in the patient-physician interaction, as physicians feel more present during a clinical encounter. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by persisting concerns regarding the accuracy, consistency, language use, and style of AI-generated notes. Studies noting errors, omissions, or hallucinations caution that diligent clinician oversight is necessary. The user experience is also heterogeneous, with benefits varying by specialty and individual workflow. Further, there are concerns about ethical and legal issues, algorithmic bias, the potential for long-term “cognitive debt” from overreliance on AI, and even the potential loss of physician autonomy. Additional pragmatic concerns include security, privacy, integration, interoperability, user acceptance and training, and the cost-effectiveness of adoption at scale. Finally, limited studies describe adoption or evaluation of these technologies by nonphysician clinicians and health professionals. Although ambient AI scribes and AI-driven documentation technologies are promising as potentially practice-changing tools, there are many questions remaining. Key issues persist, including responsible deployment with the goal of ensuring that ambient AI scribes produce clinical documentation that supports more efficient, equitable, and patient-centered care. To advance our collective understanding and address key issues, JMIR Medical Informatics is launching a call for papers for a new section on “Ambient AI Scribes and AI-Driven Documentation Technologies.” As editors, we look forward to the opportunity to advance the science and understanding of these fields through publishing high-quality and rigorous scholarly work in this new section of JMIR Medical Informatics."

      "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for enhancing clinical care by automating documentation, supporting decision-making, and improving communication. However, their integration into real-world healthcare workflows remains limited and under characterized. This systematic review aims to evaluate the literature on real-world implementation of LLMs in clinical workflows, including their use cases, clinical settings, observed outcomes, and challenges. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for studies published between January 2015 and April 2025 that assessed LLMs in real-world clinical applications. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed, full-text studies in English reporting empirical implementation of LLMs in clinical settings. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the PROBAST tool. Results Four studies published between 2024 and 2025 met inclusion criteria. All used generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). Reported applications included outpatient communication, mental health support, inbox message drafting, and clinical data extraction. LLM deployment was associated with improvements in operational efficiency, user satisfaction, and reduced workload. However, challenges included performance variability across data types, limitations in generalizability, regulatory delays, and lack of post-deployment monitoring. Conclusions Early evidence suggests that LLMs can enhance clinical workflows, but real-world adoption remains constrained by systemic, technical, and regulatory barriers. To support safe and scalable use, future efforts should prioritize standardized evaluation metrics, multi-site validation, human oversight, and implementation frameworks tailored to clinical settings.

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) transition from static tools to fully agentic systems, their potential for transforming social science research has become increasingly evident. This paper introduces a structured framework for understanding the diverse applications of LLM-based agents, ranging from simple data processors to complex, multi-agent systems capable of simulating emergent social dynamics. By mapping this developmental continuum across six levels, the paper clarifies the technical and methodological boundaries between different agentic architectures, providing a comprehensive overview of current capabilities and future potential. It highlights how lower-tier systems streamline conventional tasks like text classification and data annotation, while higher-tier systems enable novel forms of inquiry, including the study of group dynamics, norm formation, and large-scale social processes. However, these advancements also introduce significant challenges, including issues of reproducibility, ethical oversight, and the risk of emergent biases. The paper critically examines these concerns, emphasizing the need for robust validation protocols, interdisciplinary collaboration, and standardized evaluation metrics. It argues that while LLM-based agents hold transformative potential for the social sciences, realizing this promise will require careful, context-sensitive deployment and ongoing methodological refinement. The paper concludes with a call for future research that balances technical innovation with ethical responsibility, encouraging the development of agentic systems that not only replicate but also extend the frontiers of social science, offering new insights into the complexities of human behavior."

      "abstract": "Integrating large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into computer science education offers transformative potential for complex courses such as data structures and algorithms (DSA). This study examines ChatGPT as a supplementary tool for teaching assistants (TAs), guided by structured prompts and human oversight, to enhance instruction and student outcomes. A controlled experiment compared traditional TA-led instruction with a hybrid approach where TAs used ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT o1 to generate exercises, clarify concepts, and provide feedback. Structured prompts emphasized problem decomposition, real-world context, and code examples, enabling tailored support while mitigating over-reliance on AI. Results demonstrated the hybrid approach’s efficacy, with students in the ChatGPT-assisted group scoring 16.50 points higher on average and excelling in advanced topics. However, ChatGPT’s limitations necessitated TA verification. This framework highlights the dual role of LLMs: augmenting TA efficiency while ensuring accuracy through human oversight, offering a scalable solution for human-AI collaboration in education."

      "abstract": "In their article, Ragan and colleagues (1) make the latest case for a national, coordinated biobanking system to support clinical decision making and translational research— to enable an efficient and facile response to a pandemic. In the absence of an existing resource, these authors had to launch their own biobanking operation to serve the urgent needs of their patient, physician, and scientist communities in themidst of a protracted internationalmedical crisis. Their biobanking effort included obtaining patient consent, collecting specimens, and annotating samples with clinical data. Specimens were collected from inpatients and outpatients after retrieval from clinical pathology laboratories and autopsies, and patient-specific clinical data were painstakingly linked to specimens. Oversight committees were established to review applications for specimen use and arbitrate the distribution of samples. Challenging under the best of circumstances, these activities faced formidable obstacles during the pandemic. Coordinated support fromphysicians, nurses, hospital staff, and administration was required. In the absence of federal support, the hospital and private foundations shouldered the burden of funding despite the likelihood of national benefit. Meeting these challenges de novo during a global public health emergencywas aHerculean task. The banking of human biological samples requires strict adherence to scientific, ethical, and regulatory requirements. The mere—albeit colossal—organizational and administrative feat of collecting specimens, data, and patient consent and sagely adjudicating their distribution is insufficient. Specimen quality is at least as important as quantity. To guarantee the quality of the specimens distributed to users, biobanks must impose data-driven, evidencebased, standard operating procedures for sample collection, handling, processing, and storage. Procedures for ensuring the security of protected health information linked to samples must be established and vigilantly monitored. Further, an overarching quality management system is necessary for preventive and corrective action to continually course-correct across the enterprise. These additional aspects of biobanking are a heavy lift. Whether the biobanking system described by Ragan and colleagues achieved them all is unclear. Molecular analysis of biospecimens demands a high level of molecular integrity of the sample. Without strict attention to and control of critical preanalytic variables that have the capacity to alter molecular composition and quality of specimens, biobanks risk contributing to the problem of irreproducible data polluting the archives of biomedicine. Today's powerful analytic technologies ensure a result when a molecular test is done on a specimen. The challenge is ensuring that the result reflects the pathobiology of the patient's disorder and not merely the artefact introduced by problematicmanipulation of the specimen. Biobanking done correctly is not for the faint of heart. It requires massive coordination of patients, medical professionals, ethicists, scientists, information technologists, managers, administrators, and fundraisers. Although it is the sine qua non of translational research, funders frequently deny biobanking sufficient financial support. Europe has a vast, government-funded, well-coordinated biobanking infrastructure, the Biobanking and BioMolecular resources Research Infrastructure–European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC). However, discounting the networked biobanks associated with federally funded clinical trials groups, the United States lacks national biobanking. Therefore, most efforts, from massive undertakings like The Cancer Genome Atlas program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute to projects initiated by single investigators, rely on institutional biobanks. These biobanks often lack enforced standards and sustained funding. Global and national authoritative sources, such as the International Organization for Standardization (2), the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (3), the NCI (4), and the BiorepositoryAccreditationProgramof theCollegeofAmerican Pathologists (5), issue best practices for biobanking. Unfortunately, all of these are voluntary, and none are widely enforced. For such an essential component of research, it is unthinkable that biobanking continues to be so problematic. Large-scale biobanking in the United States lacks constitutive funding, quality regulation, scalability, and sustainability. As demonstrated by Europe's BBMRI-ERIC, it is possible to develop interoperable, standardized, federated systems capable of amassing the requisite type, quality, and quantity of biological samples and associated clinical data needed to support research. There is little question that BBMRI-ERIC has made Europe more competitive in the translational research arena. Biobanking systems could—and some would argue should—be goal-specific. In this regard, patient advocacy groups have successfully stepped in to fill the biobanking void to accelerate research related to their specific diseases of interest. Yet, too much specificity can be limiting. Even a pandemic-focused biobanking effort, such as the one Ragan and colleagues suggest, requires specimens from patients with a range of underlying conditions to enable study of disease interactions and synergies, prognosis, and variation in response to therapy. Some, including myself, have long believed that a national, high-quality biobanking infrastructure is sorely needed and long overdue. Others, like Ragan and colleagues, have become believers under the duress of a biomedical emergency. Such an infrastructure unfortunately requires substantial investment and commitment on a national level, which can become a political issue. An April 2021 poll suggested that the hesitancy to accept COVID-19 vaccination is largely due to distrust of science (6). If the public does not trust the science that directly and immediately benefits them, it is difficult to believe"

      "abstract": "© 2016 Journal of Natural Science, Biology and Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow Advancement in life science is happening at a rapid scale, with occasional reports of blockbuster discoveries. One such discovery, which is currently trending, is the report on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which is a powerful and precise gene-editing tool. While the medical benefi ts of such a technology are obvious, the risks and, most importantly, the ethical concerns collaterally associated with such risks need in-depth analysis, so as to place appropriate preventive measures to avoid abuse of such technology. Although only a few studies are published on CRISPR technology so far, the products of such gene editing approach are already appearing commercially. One such example is the micro-pig created by BGI, Shenzen, China, which is evolving the era of designer pets amid ethical concerns. While the legality and ethical perception on such products developed may vary across the geographical domains; nevertheless, there is a need for universal consensus on socially responsible use of such a powerful technology, specifi cally considering equipotential risks and benefits of such technology. Nevertheless, progression in this technology will add considerably to the next domain of therapeutics, which over the years has evolved from crude extracts, receptor targeting, and specifi c small molecule therapeutics to the ultimate holy grail of precision engineering (repair/ replacement) of biomolecules. This advancement brings considerable refi nement to the fi eld of pharmacology by incorporating the biomolecular-engineering which can be broadly be classifi ed as genopharmacology/therapeutics (a therapeutic approach involving precise editing/ engineering of genes/biomolecules). Such a paradigm shift in the fi eld will necessarily involve successful replication of studies reported using this technology by multiple independent research groups globally. Such replications are necessary in addressing a very important issue on reliability of scientifi c reports, which has been intensively discussed recently as currently a signifi cant amount of data reported in scientifi c literature cannot be replicated. The reasons for lack of study replications may be multi-factorial, including poor study designs, inappropriate use of experimental models, and in some instances gross neglect or oversights. Hence, as highlighted in our previous editorials, it is necessary to have transparency and avoid biasness in all aspects of scientifi c research to improve its validity. Unless these two important parameters can be fully achieved, the reliability of any scientifi c research will continue to be questioned. Surprisingly, such lack in replicability of scientifi c results has also led some sceptics to question the utility of experimental animals as reliable models to understand human diseases, which has disappointingly led to unnecessary restrictions in the use of animals in scientifi c research. This is despite the enormous wealth of information available in the public domain supporting the benefi ts animal models has contributed in development of almost all the available medicines used for therapeutics currently. Such scepticism can only delay but not deny scientifi c advancement and probably, this will hold good for CRISPR-Cas9 technology as well."

      "abstract": "Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have emerged as potentially valuable technologies to augment human expertise in healthcare. However, uncertainties remain regarding appropriate clinical applications and limitations. This review synthesizes current evidence on using generative AI for clinical decision support, patient data processing, and medical education. Methods: A systematic search of Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases identified 33 relevant studies published in 2023 examining ChatGPT for healthcare uses. Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, AI system details, key results, and authors' conclusions. Evidence was synthesized qualitatively using a comparative analysis approach. Results: Supervised use of ChatGPT-generated simulations appeared beneficial for clinical training, but oversight was critical. Numerous studies found risks in relying on ChatGPT's clinical suggestions given frequent factual errors, outdated recommendations, and inappropriate advice. However, ChatGPT demonstrated potential for enhancing workflows via medical documentation automation. Conclusions: While showing promise for constrained uses like supervised education and documentation, findings caution against open-ended ChatGPT integration in clinical practice currently. Additional large-scale comparative effectiveness research is imperative to establish evidence-based implementation guidance. Responsible translation requires governance, validation against literature, and focus on human-AI collaboration versus replacement. Further inquiry can illuminate best practices for balancing innovation and safety."

      "abstract": "This narrative review provides an in-depth interpretation of the limited evidence available on social harms associated with HIV partner notification services. Findings reflect knowledge gaps and areas where future research could make contributions. Key Findings The majority of studies reviewed reported less than 1% of participants experienced social harms as a result of HIV partner notification services. The most prevalent form of social harm presented across the studies was relationship dissolution, followed by violence and loss of financial support. Key Implications HIV partner notification services, using passive or assisted approaches, are a safe and effective method of identifying people living with HIV and linking them to care. Although social harms associated with HIV partner notification do occur, they are rare. It is important for countries to ensure the required minimum standards are in place to support providers, clients, and their partners without imposing unacceptable risks. ABSTRACT Introduction: HIV partner notification services (PNS) are highly effective in identifying people living with HIV, but the complex risks and repercussions associated with HIV testing and disclosure must be examined. The benefits of assisting people to learn their HIV status and link with treatment or prevention based on their results must be considered alongside the risks of adverse events or social harms. Methods: The study team systematically searched the PubMed, EBSCO, and Web of Science electronic databases (2015–2021), as well as abstracts from the International AIDS Society Conference (2016–2020) and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (2015–2020). Fifteen studies and 1 conference abstract met the inclusion criteria for this narrative review. Results and Discussion: Incidence of social harms across studies ranged from 0%–6.3%, with the higher range occurring among women with a previous history of intimate partner violence (IPV). The majority of the studies (69%) reported that less than or equal to 1% of participants experienced social harms as a result of PNS. Social harms included relationship dissolution, IPV, and loss of financial support. Conclusions: Evidence from a limited set of studies suggests that although social harms associated with HIV partner notification do occur, they are rare. Considering the rapid global scale-up of PNS, additional research and oversight are needed to provide countries with recommended minimum standards to support providers, clients, and their partners with safe partner notification."

      "abstract": "The scientific discourse surrounding Chronic Lyme Disease (CLD) and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) has evolved over the past twenty-five years into a complex and polarised debate, shaped by shifting research priorities, institutional influences, and competing explanatory models. This study presents the first large-scale, systematic examination of this discourse using an innovative hybrid AI-driven methodology, combining large language models with structured human validation to analyse thousands of scholarly abstracts spanning 25 years. By integrating computational techniques with expert oversight, we developed a quantitative framework for tracking epistemic shifts in contested medical fields, with applications to other content analysis domains. Our analysis revealed a progressive transition from infection-based models of Lyme disease to immune-mediated explanations for persistent symptoms, a shift that has been particularly pronounced in high-impact clinical and immunology journals. At the same time, research supporting CLD has remained largely confined to hypothesis-driven publications, indicating a persistent asymmetry in how competing perspectives are disseminated and legitimised. The investigation into thematic trends further highlighted the enduring complexity of Lyme disease diagnostics and evolving research focus on therapeutic controversies, even as institutional alignment with PTLDS perspectives continues to grow. This study offers new empirical insights into the structural and epistemic forces shaping Lyme disease research, providing a scalable and replicable methodology for analysing discourse. The findings have implications for policymakers, clinicians, and communication strategists, emphasising the need for more equitable research funding, standardised diagnostic criteria, and improved patient-centred care models. This research also underscores the value of AI-assisted methodologies in social science and medical research by systematically quantifying discourse evolution, offering a foundation for future studies examining other contested conditions and controversies."

      "abstract": "In safety-critical software systems, cybersecurity activities become essential, with risk assessment being one of the most critical. In many software teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented by only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these experts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct cybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support cybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats during the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of leveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain while complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit external data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts in interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project. The results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by generating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing redundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight to ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing to utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely relying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that encourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of cyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains."

      "abstract": "Radiology has continuously evolved exploring cutting-edge technologies to improve patient care. It is a prime example of how medical science is propelled forward by technological innovation.In recent times, artificial intelligence (AI) has played a crucial role in various technological advancements. Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT)-4, an AI language model primarily focusing on natural language understanding and generation, is increasingly used to retrieve medical information. This study explores the utility of ChatGPT-4o in aiding imaging-guided musculoskeletal interventions, detailing its advantages and limitations.Two musculoskeletal radiologists assessed the information generated by ChatGPT on common musculoskeletal interventions. They analyzed the overall utility of ChatGPT-4o in guiding musculoskeletal interventions by examining the procedure steps and pre- and post-procedure details provided. The assessment was documented in a 5-point Likert scale and subjected to statistical analysis.The statistical analysis of Likert scale scores by both readers revealed a moderate level of inter-rater agreement, as indicated by a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.54. Across the categories, the mode of Likert score ranged from 1 to 3, as rated by both readers, indicating suboptimal performance. The lowest scores were observed in image quality assessments, whereas the highest ratings were of post-procedure details.ChatGPT-4o offers structured procedural guidance but falls short in complex, image-dependent tasks due to limited anatomical detail and contextual accuracy. It may aid education, but not clinical use without expert oversight. Domain-specific training, validation, and multidisciplinary collaboration are essential for safe and effective integration into practice."

      "abstract": "Ethical and regulatory oversight of research animals is focused on vertebrates and rarely includes invertebrates. Our aim was to undertake the first study to describe differences in public confidence, trust, and expectations for the oversight of scientists using animals in research. Participants were presented with one of four treatments using a 2 by 2 design; terrestrial (T; mice and grasshoppers) vs. aquatic (A; zebrafish and sea stars) and vertebrates (V; mice and zebrafish) vs. invertebrates (I; grasshoppers and sea stars). A representative sample of census-matched Canadian participants (n = 959) stated their confidence in oversight, trust in scientists and expectation of oversight for invertebrates on a 7-point Likert scale. Participants’ open-ended text reasoning for confidence and expectations of oversight were subjected to thematic analysis. Participants believed invertebrates should receive some level of oversight but at two-thirds of that currently afforded to vertebrates. Four primary themes emerged to explain participant expectation: (1) value of life, (2) animal experience, (3) participant reflection, and (4) oversight system centered. Confidence in oversight was highest for TV (mean ± SE; 4.5 ± 0.08) and AV (4.4 ± 0.08), less for TI (3.8 ± 0.10), and least for AI (3.5 ± 0.08), indicating the absence of oversight decreased public confidence. Four themes emerged to explain participant confidence, centered on: (1) animals, (2) participant reflection, (3) oversight system, and (4) science. Trust in scientists was similar for TV (4.3 ± 0.07) and AV (4.2 ± 0.07), but higher for TV compared to TI (4.1 ± 0.07) and TV and AV compared to AI (4.0 ± 0.06); absence of oversight decreased public trust in scientists. These results, provide the first evidence that the public believe invertebrates should receive some level of oversight if used for scientific experiments. The gap that exists between current and public expectations for the oversight of invertebrates may threaten the social licence to conduct scientific research on these animals."

      "abstract": "Cancer survivors face an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to treatment-related toxicity, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities. Addressing CV health is crucial for improving quality of life and long-term outcomes. The American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 framework highlights modifiable determinants of CV health, emphasizing early detection and monitoring. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as wearables and smartphone apps, offer continuous tracking, yet their applications in cancer survivorship remain unclear. This review systematically characterizes the types of mHealth technologies used to monitor CV health in cancer survivors, focusing on the specific data collected (major adverse CV events, CV risk factors, and surrogate endpoints) and the use of active versus passive collection methods. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science identified studies published between January 1, 2016, and June 13, 2024. Eligible studies included observational and interventional designs assessing at least one CV outcome using mHealth. Data were extracted on design, technology type, and outcomes. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB-2 and ROBINS-I tools. Fourteen studies (13 interventional, one observational) met criteria. Physical activity was the most monitored risk factor, followed by HR. The most common technologies were mobile apps and commercial wearables. Passive methods typically captured PA and HR, while active methods captured PA, symptom tracking, and diet. A key finding was the lack of integration with electronic medical records, highlighting a gap in clinical implementation. mHealth provides scalable tools to track CV health indicators in cancer survivors. Findings highlight the potential to support practice by enabling remote oversight of risk-reducing behaviors and guiding lifestyle interventions. However, we also identified gaps, including the underutilization of biomarkers (e.g., HRV) and the lack of integration with electronic records. Future research must address these gaps to translate real-time data into clinical insights and optimize survivorship care."

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the feasibility and potential role of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support systemic risk audits under the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA). It examines how automated tools can enhance the work of DSA auditors and other ecosystem actors by enabling scalable, explainable, and legally grounded content analysis. An interdisciplinary expert workshop with twelve participants from legal, technical, and social science backgrounds explored prompting strategies for LLM-assisted auditing. Thematic analysis of the sessions identified key challenges and design considerations, including prompt engineering, model interpretability, legal alignment, and user empowerment. Findings highlight the potential of LLMs to improve annotation workflows and expand audit scale, while underscoring the continued importance of human oversight, iterative testing, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. This study offers practical insights for integrating AI tools into auditing processes and contributes to emerging methodologies for operationalizing systemic risk evaluations under the DSA."

      "abstract": "The rise of computational propaganda has introduced unprecedented challenges for democratic governance, fueled by the rapid proliferation of disinformation, AI-generated content, and algorithm-driven influence campaigns. Unlike traditionalpropaganda, computational propaganda operates at scale, leveraging automation, synthetic media, and personalization to undermine trust, manipulate electorates, and exacerbate polarization. By 2025, these dynamics have intensified as advances in generative artificial intelligence and algorithmic amplification coincide with critical global elections and growing democratic fragility. This study pursues three objectives: first, to analyze the implications of computational propaganda for democratic institutions, trust, and electoral integrity; second, to examine multidisciplinary strategies from political science, communication studies, technology, psychology, and law; and third, to recommend integrated solutions for enhancing resilience. Methodologically, the paper adopts a qualitative and conceptual review supported by secondary data, including comparative case studies from the United States, the European Union, and Africa, as well as policy analyses such as the EU’s Digital Services Act. The findings underscore the urgency of cross-disciplinary collaboration, proposing technological innovation, regulatory oversight, civic education, and international cooperation as mutually reinforcing safeguards to protect democracy against evolving digital threats."

Drugs banned in other countries are still available in India. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of medical resident (MR) and dental resident (DR) regarding the availability and use of drugs that have been globally discarded but are still accessible in India.\n\n\n\nA cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2024 to August 2024, involving 100 MRs and DRs from various colleges in Chennai. Participants interested in the survey were included in the study. A set of 18 questions were formulated and directed to the participants. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software.\n\n\n\nAround 93.0% of MR and 80.7% of DRs were aware that some globally banned drugs are available in India. On evaluating the difference in knowledge regarding globally discarded drugs availability in India among MRs and DRs, no difference in knowledge and awareness was elicited. Around 39.5% of MR and 35.1% of DR perceive that creating awareness about adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting among healthcare professionals and patients could impart drug safety in India.\n\n\n\nThese findings highlight the need for enhanced educational initiatives targeting healthcare professionals to increase awareness about the risks associated with globally banned drugs. Moreover, strengthening the ADR reporting system and ensuring strict regulatory oversights are crucial steps toward improving drug safety in India.\n"

      "abstract": "This study is on implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by reporting entities in Nigeria. Since Nigeria adopted IFRS in 2010, managers of reporting entities have been confronted with organizational changes both in the structures and processes of financial reporting. Previous studies have not assessed the claims that adopting IFRS improves the quality of financial reports and managerial efficiency. This study evaluated the assertion that IFRS adoption impacts the quality of financial reports, operational costs, and operational efficiencies of management. The theoretical frameworks which undergirded the study were theories of organizational behaviors and attitudinal change. Data were collected via a stratified sampling of 520 respondents who completed a 5-point Likert scale, which has a long history of reliability and usage in social science research. This study adopted a documentary review of financial statements before and after IFRS implementation to evaluate how IFRS adoption affected them. Logistic regression was used to test the main effects of IFRS adoption as independent variable to predict managerial efficiency as outcome variable. The study found statistically significant improvement in the quality of financial reporting and managerial efficiency following IFRS adoption. Participants’ perceptions about IFRS measured on the attitudes scale did not significantly predict managerial efficiency, however, and the cost and benefit of implementing IFRS had no significant relationship with managerial efficiency. The study has positive social change implications as its findings, when implemented, may lead to more efficient company management, business expansion, improved government accounting oversight, more job opportunities, and reduced crime rates."

      "abstract": "Zambia’s Agricultural sector is crucial to realizing the country's Vision 2030 — an efficient, competitive, and export-driven agricultural sector that ensures food security and higher incomes. This study aimed to assess the delays during the implementation of agriculture donor-funded projects in Zambian public sector. The study was guided by three objectives: (i) to ascertain the effect of stakeholder engagement; (ii) to assess the impact of supplier/contractor capacity; and (iii) to analyze the effect of contract management during the implementation of agriculture donor-funded projects. A descriptive research design and a quantitative approach were adopted, focusing on staff from the Project Implementation Units, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, and the Ministry of Finance and National Planning. A sample size of 109 was derived from a population of 120 using stratified random sampling technique. Data was collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire set in a 1 to 5 point Likert Scale format. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 30 was used to analysis data. Findings revealed that poor stakeholder engagement was a significant cause of delays, with insufficient understanding of stakeholder expectations and inconsistent involvement often leading to unmet project objectives. The study further found that supplier/contractor capacity was critical to minimizing delays, while many contract managers faced challenges due to work overload, inadequate capacity, and lack of skills. Drawing on international best practices, especially from other African contexts, the study highlighted effective engagement strategies to improve project outcomes in Zambia. These include prioritizing tailored stakeholder engagement strategies supported with a strong policy framework, providing continuous training for PIU staff, appointing independent technical evaluation committees to rigorously assess the technical and financial capabilities of suppliers, and recruiting full-time contract managers for effective contract management oversight."

      "abstract": "Objectives This study analyses the trend of artificial intelligence (AI)-related publications in the medical field over the past decade and demonstrates the potential of AI in automating data analysis. We hypothesise exponential growth in AI-related publications, with continuous growth in the foreseeable future. Methods Retrospective, AI-assisted analysis was conducted using the OpenAI application programming interface for data collection and evaluation. Publications from the top 50 medical journals (Web of Science, Journal Citation Report, 2022) covering 2014 to June 2024. A total of 315 209 papers were initially retrieved with 212 620 remaining after filtering. The outcomes were the total number and percentage of AI-related publications per year, with future trends prediction using statistical models. Results AI-related publications increased from approximately 500 in 2014 to over 1000 in 2022, with the percentage rising from 2.5% to over 6% in 2024. The analysis identified cardiology and oncology as leading in AI adoption. Predictive models forecast that AI-related publications could reach 10% by 2030 with long-term projections suggesting potential dominance of AI presence by the mid-22nd century. Discussion The study highlights the significant growth and integration of AI in medical research, with cardiology and oncology at the forefront. AI-assisted data analysis proves efficient and scalable but requires human oversight to maintain credibility. Conclusions The trajectory of AI-related publications indicates substantial growth and future integration across medical disciplines. Ongoing evaluation of AI’s reliability and applicability in medical research remains essential."

      "abstract": "Background: The complexity of healthcare delivery and concerns about graduate readiness have intensified calls for competency-based nursing education. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing’s The Essentials: Core Competencies for Professional Nursing Education (2021) and the Next Generation NCLEX (NGN) highlight the need for curricula that foster measurable competencies in clinical judgment, systems thinking, and interprofessional collaboration. A private higher education institution in the Midwest identified gaps in its existing Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) curriculum, prompting a comprehensive redesign to align with these national imperatives. Methods: A descriptive case study methodology was used to document the curriculum overhaul, drawing from institutional records, faculty retreat notes, and curriculum artifacts. The redesign process occurred in five phases: (1) strategic planning and governance, (2) concept development and curriculum mapping, (3) competency-based assessment design with behavioral indicators, (4) faculty engagement and professional development, and (5) integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to support efficiency and standardization. Results: Key outcomes included the adoption of a concept-based curriculum framework, development of observable and measurable behavioral indicators, and creation of a Master Curriculum Map linking course-level competencies to program outcomes, AACN Essentials, and the NCLEX blueprint. Faculty engagement was facilitated through retreats, workshops, and communication tools such as newsletters. AI tools, including ChatGPT, supported the drafting of competencies and indicators, improving consistency, while faculty oversight ensured contextual accuracy. The implementation of HelioCampus further enabled real-time alignment of student performance data with program outcomes. Discussion: The project highlighted that curriculum alignment with the AACN Essentials requires cultural as well as structural change. Faculty engagement, governance structures, and clear behavioral indicators were critical for ensuring shared ownership and practical application of competencies. AI proved valuable as a scaffolding tool, enhancing efficiency and standardization while maintaining the need for professional judgment. Conclusion: This case study demonstrates how intentional planning, shared governance, and innovation can drive curriculum transformation in nursing education. While limited to a single institution and process-level outcomes, the initiative offers transferable insights for nursing programs seeking scalable strategies to prepare graduates for NGN success and meet evolving healthcare demands."

      "abstract": "The forensic science literature increasingly underscores the limitations of certain conventional methodologies, citing concerns over their insufficient empirical validation, vulnerability to human error and cognitive bias, methodological inconsistencies in evidence collection, protracted processing durations, inefficiencies in handling large-scale datasets, lack of procedural standardization, and the analytical challenges posed by degraded or complex evidentiary material. This study investigates how the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into forensic sciences may contribute to overcoming the structural and operational challenges inherent in traditional forensic methodologies. It examines the implementation and contributions of AI-driven applications across diverse forensic domains, including forensic pathology, digital forensics, forensic anthropology, and crime scene investigation. In doing so, it critically engages with challenges such as algorithmic bias, transparency and the reliability which are essential considerations for the judicial acceptance of AI-generated evidence, and issues of criminal liability in AI-driven offenses, while also addressing the relevance of existing legal frameworks—most notably the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act—and the pressing need for future regulatory advancements. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of training, robust oversight mechanisms, and the development of international standards for the effective, ethical, and secure integration of AI in forensic sciences, offering recommendations to ensure justice and technological progress."

      "abstract": "Background Nearly two million adults in the United States are hospitalized with sepsis yearly, with survivors facing complications that result in high rates of hospital readmission and mortality after discharge. We demonstrated improved outcomes following discharge among sepsis survivors who participated in the Sepsis Transition And Recovery (STAR) program; however, important differences among hospitals require STAR’s adaptation to facilitate its implementation and ensure its effectiveness in new settings. Purpose The purpose of this study was to adapt STAR to hospitals with diverse characteristics. Methods We used the Making Optimal Decisions for Intervention Flexibility during Implementation (MODIFI) approach. We identified STAR core functions (i.e., effectiveness-driving features) using semi-structured key informant interviews (n = 7). We identified adaptations using semi-structured interviews with clinicians and leaders with expertise and oversight of resources related to transitions of care after sepsis hospitalization (n = 7) from four hospitals that systematically differed from the hospitals in which we originally found STAR to be effective. Results Network theory, which proposes that performance improves with more efficient flow of information within and across hospitals, underlays STAR’s eleven core functions. Adaptation included specific points-of-contact, communication preferences, and methods for achieving buy-in. We used proposed adaptations to tailor STAR protocols to each hospital. Conclusions We used MODIFI, a state-of-the-science method, to adapt a program that was effective in promoting transition and recovery in sepsis survivors to facilitate its scale-up to diverse hospitals. Future studies will assess STAR’s implementation and effectiveness in diverse hospitals."

      "abstract": "Objectives: The objective of this review was to evaluate the diagnosis and treatment of advanced and delayed sleep-wake phase disorders (ASWPD, DSWPD), both forms of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) using both human reviewers and ChatGTP to summarize relevant content. Methods: PubMed-Medline, EbscoHost, and Web of Science were searched for peer reviewed articles. Original research articles published in English were searched for full-text studies. Studies that reported quantitative data on ASWPD and DSWPD diagnosing tools and treatment options in individuals of all ages were assessed. We assessed ChatGTP 4.0s capacity to extract and summarize data from these studies and evaluated it alongside human reviewers. Results: Our review of 49 articles on CRSWD from the past 20 years found that 91% focused on DSWPD. The most common diagnostic tools were the MEQ, MCQ, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with primary methods including actigraphy and dim-light-melatonin-onset. Melatonin, often combined with light therapy and CBT, was the predominant treatment. ChatGPT-4.0 facilitated the review process with about 92% accuracy but required manual oversight for optimal results. Conclusions: Our review identified key diagnostic tools, such as MEQ and MCQ surveys, and common treatment options for ASWPD and DSWPD, including melatonin, light therapy, and CBT. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive and individualized treatment approaches for CRSWDs, with a particular focus on expanding research on ASWPD and increasing data representation across age groups. While ChatGPT shows potential in streamlining data extraction for CRSWDs, it still requires human oversight to ensure accuracy."

      "abstract": "The rapid and intensively high tempo of embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in the public domain has changed policy-making processes, especially in the US. Algorithmic rule-making, while presenting challenges of efficiency, predictive performance, and data-driven policy-making, also leads to basic questions of transparency, accountability, and regulation. This paper uses a systematic literature review (SLR) approach in analysing the influence of transparent AI systems in facilitating democratic governance and legitimacy within the U.S. public sector. The review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to provide rigor and replicability. A broad search on Scopus, Web of Science, JSTOR, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar, supported by policy briefs of US agencies like the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Government Accountability Office (GAO) resulted in 512 records. During the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 42 quality studies to be synthesized were identified. There are three clusters of themes overall: (i) the requirement for interpretable and explainable AI to foster citizen trust and policy legitimacy; (ii) systems of institutional accountability that strike a balance between risk and innovation; and (iii) mechanisms of oversight such as auditing, ethical rules, and governance structures that ensure responsible adoption of AI. The review picks up major gaps in current literature, i.e., empirical testing of algorithmic systems in actual policy environments and scarce citizen participation in AI governance mechanisms. While U.S. federal initiatives are being undertaken, e.g., the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, scaling transparency remains a concern. This research adds to the expanding literature on algorithmic governance through a systematic survey of extant knowledge, recognition of enduring gaps, and articulation of policy guidelines for transparent, accountable, and trustworthy AI systems in the U.S. public sector. Ultimately, the research asserts that algorithmic governance needs to draw upon technological advancements while protecting democratic values in order to protect fairness, legitimacy, and public trust in policymaking by AI."

Firstly we used semantic embeddings to identify student-student collusion in exam answers. Secondly we used LLMs to generate starter drafts for exam question papers. We gathered academic staff responses to the two systems through structured interviews. We describe and use a novel, LLM-powered inductive thematic analysis methodology to tag and identify themes in the interviews. All analysis was carried out on locally hosted language models. We identified 26 themes, some shared across the two systems, others unique. The academics were largely comfortable with the use of LLM technology in assessment, the exam generator system helped to kick-start exam writing and the collusion detection tool found otherwise invisible cases. Academics emphasised the need for human oversight of such systems, but were prepared to use them as they perceived that they improved the efficiency of exam processes."

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is revolutionising educational practices, particularly in assessment design, offering objectivity, efficiency, and scalability. However, concerns about reliability, fairness, and effectiveness persist among educators. This study explores lecturers' perceptions of AI-generated academic assessment design and gathers their insights on potential improvements to enhance the reliability and usability of these tools. A qualitative approach was adopted, involving in-depth interviews with twelve (12) lecturers from the Faculty of Technology and Applied Sciences at Open University Malaysia. Participants were selected based on their experience with AI-generated assessment design. Semi-structured interviews provided rich qualitative data, which were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically to identify key trends and perspectives. The findings highlight that AI tools can reduce educators’ workloads by automating repetitive tasks, but require significant human input to refine assessments, particularly for evaluating higher-order thinking skills such as critical analysis and problem-solving. Participants emphasised the importance of user training, access to advanced AI systems, and collaborative support for successful implementation. They noted that while AI tools excel at structuring assessments and generating large question banks, they fall short in handling nuanced or context-specific scenarios without human oversight. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing AI assessment tools, suggesting the integration of user feedback loops, improved algorithms, and institutional support systems. By addressing these areas, AI can contribute to more reliable, fair, and effective assessment methods, ultimately improving educational practices and academic standards at Open University Malaysia and other higher education institutions."

      "abstract": "As governments worldwide generate an unprecedented volume of education policy texts, ranging from curriculum frameworks to legislative reforms, there is growing demand for scalable and rigorous methods to analyze them. This systematic review examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been applied to education policy analysis from 2015 to 2025, highlighting key methodological trends, theoretical foundations, and ethical considerations. Framed within a pragmatic research paradigm that values methodological pluralism and practical relevance, the study integrates policy analysis theories, including the policy cycle, top-down and bottom-up models, and policy learning, with computational text analysis techniques. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted using Scopus, Web of Science, and arXiv, identifying 32 peer-reviewed studies applying validated NLP methods such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, discourse analysis, and transformer-based summarization to education policy documents. A custom appraisal rubric evaluated methodological transparency, validation metrics, ethical safeguards, and reproducibility. The studies cover 12 countries and diverse policy contexts, though most focus on English-language texts. Findings reveal increasing sophistication in NLP applications, especially through models like BERT and GPT-4, with topic modeling dominating curricular and legislative domains, and sentiment analysis widely used for stakeholder feedback. Critical gaps persist in ethical oversight, multilingual inclusivity, and participatory design. Many studies overlook non-English corpora, limiting global generalizability and reinforcing linguistic inequities. This review offers a theoretically grounded, methodologically rigorous synthesis of NLP’s role in enhancing transparency, efficiency, and responsiveness in education policy analysis. It identifies future priorities including explainable and culturally adaptive models, investment in low-resource language tools, and interdisciplinary collaboration, charting a path toward equitable and evidence-based educational governance worldwide."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Filling the knowledge gap that arises from the relationship between behavioral theories and socio-environmental management, this research aims to update global guidelines on sustainability, adding the perceptions of individuals and ensuring originality through context analysis of the Legal Amazon. The overall objective is to study the attitudes of individuals involved in socio-environmental management in Amazonian organizations. In this context, institutional, socio-environmental, and behavioral theories are confronted with the attitudinal predispositions of individuals to propose adequate predictors for the development of the Amazon region. The survey method was used, by applying a questionnaire to respondents, to quantitatively describe a complex social phenomenon involving psychological perspectives prevalent in a given social group. Sustainable development is characterized by the valorization of identity culture, while the institutional environment points to the need to reproduce management models sensitive to the Amazonian context, minimizing cognitive risks by disregarding experiential knowledge and solutions. The change in development perspective would be associated with the strengthening of links between social actors, through governance, innovation, and training, in a call for action to transform the institutional environment. The concept of predictors proposes solutions for a system that interacts through the actions of individuals and decisions of organizations responsible for behaving in the direction of sustainable development. This is an interesting challenge to present to readers, local communities, the scientific community, government officials, investors, business leaders, global society, and others interested in how Amazonian institutional agents think about socio-environmental management practices available in the literature. \n  \nObjective: The aim of this study is to investigate attitudinal measures of individuals involved in socio-environmental management within Amazonian organizations. This research intends to support future investigations and assist organizations in utilizing socio-environmental management methods. By fostering decision-making processes that value the systemic development of the environment and society through governance, based on data collection and knowledge generation aligned with the perceptions of local residents. \n  \nTheoretical Framework: This section presents the main concepts and theories underpinning this research. Key among these are Institutional Theory, Behavioral Theories, Socio-environmental Management models, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) frameworks, and sociotechnical modeling, providing a solid foundation for understanding the investigation's context. \n  \nMethod: The methodology adopted for this research is quantitative, employing a survey method designed to analyze the perceived links between science and behavioral predispositions by quantifying responses to objective questions. Data collection was conducted through the application of a self-administered questionnaire containing structured, sequenced statements, where respondents could provide scaled answers regarding their perceptions of the presented variables. \n  \nResults and Discussion: The obtained results reveal that the locality has faced conflicts since its discovery, undergoing successive stages of colonization. It possesses a vast natural territorial extension with demarcated and regulated environmental preservation areas, rich in biodiversity, and with strong unique cultural values, stemming from the interaction of different national and international colonizing cultures. The local culture was forged in this scenario and now continues to influence and be influenced by global interaction facilitated by communication media. In this context, behavioral predictors were identified for individuals and organizations to impact the interaction between these important social actors, thereby leading to better individual actions and organizational decisions. The goal is to transform the institutional environment and promote development suitable for the desires and needs of the local population. Individuals are oriented towards developing behavioral and socio-environmental factors such as awareness, identification, relationships, connection, influence, rejection, learning, research, participation, creation, oversight, and investment. Organizations, on the other hand, are directed towards socio-environmental cognitive factors including co-creation, incentive, education, influence, connection, communication, governance, innovation, technology, transparency, regulation, and subsidy.Given these identified behavioral and socio-environmental predictors, the field of Administration Science offers methodologies capable of educating individuals and organizations in each of these recommendations. This includes techniques available in theoretical topics—such as Knowledge Management, Stakeholder Management, Transformational Leadership, and Innovation Management—or in methodological topics—like Governance, Decision-Making, Coalition and Network Building, Compliance, and ESG. In the discussion section, these results are contextualized in light of the theoretical framework, highlighting the identified implications and relationships. Possible discrepancies and limitations of the study are also considered in this section. \n  \nResearch Implications: The practical and theoretical implications of this research are discussed, offering insights into how the results can be applied and influence practices in the field. This study provides valuable managerial contributions derived from its findings, particularly through the development of organizational predictors aligned with the behavioral intentions of local individuals. These implications extend beyond traditional investigations into characteristics of potential socio-environmental phenomena or technological solutions as mere measures capable of innovating and changing our reality. Instead, human behavior is leveraged as the cornerstone of transformation, driven by societal interests. This approach significantly increases the likelihood of these practices being adopted and positively impacting life and its interactions with the natural environment, fostered by cultural propagation, acceptance, and synergistic collaboration among all stakeholders. \n  \nOriginality/Value: This study contributes to the existing literature by delving into the relationship between behavioral theories and socio-environmental management concepts. It critically analyzes global methodologies and projects implemented in specific contexts, aiming to promote adaptations that connect local communities with best practices in socio-environmental management. The study proposes a construct of socio-environmentally acceptable attitudinal measures, emerging from the exploration of local cultural characteristics and giving voice to underrepresented groups. The relevance and value of this research are evidenced by the insights gleaned from the responses expressed by local individuals regarding their perceived institutional environment. This reveals a strong attitudinal anchoring among them to transform local realities based on sustainable development, leveraging cultural, intellectual, and experiential factors as valuable assets available in the region. Associated with the attitudinal anchoring of individuals is the perceived opportunity gap in organizational decisions to more strongly promote this environment, which is in dire need of effective socio-environmental actions."

      "abstract": "Background Headache disorders, particularly migraine, are highly prevalent, but often remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising applications in diagnosis, prediction of attacks, analysis of neuroimaging and neurophysiology data, and treatment selection. Its use in headache medicine raises ethical, regulatory, and clinical questions, including its impact on the doctor–patient relationship. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted on April 10, 2025, across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and DOAJ, following PRISMA guidelines. Two reviewers independently applied strict inclusion criteria to select studies published from 2000 to 2025 in either English or Spanish. Risk of bias was assessed using validated tools tailored to study design, including the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2), Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), and Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS). Results A total of 76 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The analysis covered AI methodologies, clinical applications, patient perspectives, and ethical implications. AI tools have shown potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, headache subtype classification, and prediction of treatment response, and may help reduce the administrative burden in clinical practice. Emerging technologies such as digital twins, wearable biomarker monitoring, and synthetic data generation support personalized approaches and may reshape clinical research. However, significant challenges remain. These include data quality, model interpretability, algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, and regulatory gaps. Moreover, the evidence base is still developing, with expectations often exceeding the strength of available clinical data. Many studies present methodological limitations due to small sample sizes, selection bias, and lack of external validation, which limit their generalizability to real-world settings. Finally, concerns about depersonalization and transparency affect patient trust in AI, reinforcing the need for both human oversight and a patient-centered approach. Conclusions AI holds promise for improving headache care, but evidence supporting its clinical utility is still limited. Integration into practice must be rigorously validated, ethically guided, and carefully designed to prevent depersonalization. Human oversight remains essential as AI should complement, not replace, clinical judgment."

      "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant different consequences for everyday life of every human being, as well as on the functioning of health, educational and scientific institutions. Objective: The aim of this article is to provide information on impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientific research in the biomedical sciences, and publications, as wll as impact on education in medcine and clinical training. Methods: Papers published of influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the main aim were searched and analyzed. Results: Many basic research labs quickly tuned their priorities and continud to study different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Biomedical sciences have become an important area in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, due to the unique challenges posed by the pandemic, including epidemiological aspects, immune mechanisms of the disease, clinical parameters of this essentially multisystem disease, virus properties, infection mechanisms, and later work on finding vaccines and everything that is needed. There are several studies that point to the negative impact of the pandemic on biomedical education, especially in the acquisition of practical clinical skills among medical students. The negative impact, both on basic education in medicine, and also on the acquisition of practical knowledge within various clinical disciplines, especially surgery, unfortunately continues. The COVID-19 pandemic has mobilised researchers worldwide on a scale and timeframe that have never been seen before for one specific disease. The number of COVID-19 manuscripts being submitted for peer review has also greatly increased. Unfortunately, research and publications on COVID-19 has so far often not been of high quality and many unprinted preprints have been rushed to spread without sufficient oversight. The time between submission and publication of articles on COVID-19 has decreased on average by around 50%. This analysis also showed that the time to publication for research not related to COVID-19 has remained unaffected, and that the number of research articles unrelated to COVID-19 has dropped considerably, with COVID-19 predominating in receipt of funding and attention from the research community. Conclusion: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education and scientific research in biomedical sciences are negative. Almost all aspects of medical education were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The negative impact, both on basic education in medicine, and also on the acquisition of practical knowledge within various clinical disciplines, especially surgery, unfortunately continues. There has been no disease in the history of medicine about which several professional and scientific articles have been written in a relatively short time. Research and publications on COVID-19 has often not been of high quality. Research articles from many medical field unrelated to COVID-19 were less published. A pandemic with a \"paperdemic\" will be even more complicated to manage if it progresses in an uncontrolled manner and is not properly scrutinized."

      "abstract": "Purpose – The study aimed to examine the factors affecting the use of cost methods which businesses use and product pricing over the auditing professional members working in the provinces of Bursa, Istanbul and others.\nDesign / Method / Approach – By benefiting from the questionnaire questions belonging to the tested academic scales leading in the field of auditing, a model with four variables, two independent, one intervening and one dependent, was formed. In this model, a total of five hypotheses were established. In order to test the model, the research based testing method (RBV) was used. The questionnaire was administered via the permission basen on the 3rd June 2020 dated and 2020/3 numbered decision made by Bursa Uludag Universitesi Social Sciences and Humanities and Publication Ethics Committee.\nDesign/methodology/approach – According to the findings, \"cost methods\" used by businesses have the highest effect on \"price determination\". Businesses subjected to auditing are mostly using normal cost method. Businesses using cost method are able to calculate better prices. In the tables, it is observed that the auditors' annual auditing number is low and the sample distribution results of the study are significant. \"The records made in accordance with\" accounting system is very important in cost determination. Moreover, a significant positive relationship was found between “appropriate record\" and both cost calculation and \"pricing decisions\".\nDiscussion – According to the obtained results, four of five hypotheses proposed in the study were accepted and one was rejected. Auditors believe that professional institutions do not give sufficient support to businesses about the matter of cost calculation. It is observed that the auditors accept the existence of a significant positive relationship between cost method and pricing. In this respect, from an auditor's perspective, recording is required to be made in accordance with the accounting system and POI (Public Oversight Institution) trainings require continuing. It was concluded that with sufficient professional support, recording made in line with the standards and the use of a cost method, businesses can work with more competitive price offers."

This editorial provides an overview of the contributions included in this Special Issue, titled “Human Stem Cells in Disease Modelling and Treatment”, placing them within the wider landscape of stem cell science. We summarize advances in ovarian stem cells for infertility, mesenchymal stem cells for neurodegeneration, pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiovascular and kidney organoids, adipose-derived stem cells, and emerging immunomodulatory and neural progenitor approaches. These studies illustrate the breadth of stem cell research and its potential to inform clinical practice. At the same time, challenges remain in reproducibility, safety, scalability, and ethical oversight. Looking forward, collaborative work and harmonized global standards will be important to bring laboratory findings into therapies that are safe, effective, and accessible. This editorial closes the first edition of the Special Issue with a reflection on current progress and directions for the future."

In this pre-registered, quasi-experimental study, we examine California’s recent initiative to improve early literacy across the state’s lowest-performing schools. The Early Literacy Support Block Grant (ELSBG) provided teacher professional development grounded in the science of reading as well as aligned supports (e.g., assessments and interventions), new funding (about $1,000 per student), spending flexibility within specified guidelines, and expert facilitation and oversight of school-based planning. Our preferred specification finds that ELSBG generated significant (and cost-effective) improvements in English Language Arts (ELA) achievement in its first years of implementation (0.14 standard deviation) as well as smaller improvements in math."

      "abstract": "For several nations who are developing, forests play a crucial role in rural life. Due to the incredible challenges associated with staff, logistics, and chronological consistency of field-based surveys for forest management, a variety of sources of data obtained by airborne, space-borne, and terrestrial remote sensing sensors are now essential sources of knowledge for studies on the spatiotemporal patterns of forests. Most recently, understanding of forests and their conservation has been derived primarily from satellite imagery. The process of organizing and carrying out procedures for the management and use of forests can be done with the assistance of remote sensing in order to achieve economic, social, cultural, and environmental goals. Satellite remote sensing has been providing ever-more-advanced knowledge about woodland structure, management, monitoring, and oversight whenever the first civilian earth-observing program was launched. This article reviewed the application of remote sensing on forestry. Data were gathered from published research papers, books, internet resources, and expert observation. Remote sensing’s synoptic view, availability in a rage of spatial-temporal scales, high degree of homogeneity, inexpensiveness as well as the increasing trend in availability make it special in forest science. As observed from the review, remote sensing technology is critical in forest management. It helps to provide up to date information on forest cover change, forest fire, forest disturbance, forest wildlife management, forest biomass and others. Remote sensing is vital in providing scientific information in forest resources monitoring and management"

      "abstract": "Records of past climate trends, variability, and extremes hold key insights into Earth’s changing climate, yet their full potential will remain untapped without a concerted effort to surmount several critical challenges, some time-sensitive. In a century defined by accelerating climate change and human disturbance, the climate archive itself is at grave risk given that i) many paleoclimate records end in the late 20 th century, with no concerted effort to extend them to the present-day, and ii) many paleoclimate archives are disappearing under pressure from climate change and/or human disturbance. Second, many paleoclimate records are comprised of oxygen isotopes, yet the coordinated, multi-scale observational and modeling infrastructures required to unravel the mechanisms governing water isotope variability are as yet underdeveloped. This dramatic oversight exists despite development of technologies that avoid costly analysis via mass spectrometers, and despite the fact that water isotopes may very well be one of the most powerful diagnostic tracers of a changing global water cycle. Lastly, in part owing to the aforementioned deficiencies, paleoclimate data assimilation efforts remain fraught with large uncertainties, despite their promise in constraining many of the most uncertain aspects of future climate impacts, including the evolution of extreme events and hydrological trends and variability. Climate science for the 21 st century requires deep investments in the full integration of paleoclimate data and approaches into frameworks for climate risk and hazard assessments. In this sense, it is not surprising that paleoclimate scientists have played a key role in the communication of climate change science to decision-makers and the general public alike. Their understanding of the Earth system also equips them to contribute valuable insights to teams comprised of researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers charged with leveraging science to inform solutions, in service to society. It’s time to recognize that all climate scientists study climate of the past, and all paleoclimate scientists have insights that are relevant to our climate future."

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Advancements in medical science have focused largely on patient care, often overlooking the well-being of health care professionals (HCPs). This oversight has consequences; not only are HCPs prone to mental and physical health challenges, but the quality of patient care may also endure as a result. Such concerns are also exacerbated by unprecedented crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to other sectors, HCPs report high incidence of stress, depression, and suicide, among other challenging factors that have a significant negative impact on their well-being. Objective Given these substantial concerns, the development of a tool specifically designed to be used in clinical settings to measure the well-being of HCPs is essential. Methods A United Kingdom–based cross-sectional pilot study was carried out to measure self-reported well-being in a cohort of 148 physicians, using the newly developed well-being thermometer. The aim of the tool is to allow respondents to develop an individual sense of “well-being intelligence” thus supporting HCPs to have better insight and control over their well-being and allow insights into how to manage it. The tool consists of 5 well-being domains—health, thoughts, emotions, spiritual, and social. Each domain can be measured individually or combined to produce an overall well-being score. Results The tool demonstrated good internal consistency; the Cronbach α in this study was 0.84 for the total scale. Conclusions Results from this cohort demonstrated that the well-being thermometer can be used to gather intelligence of staff well-being. This is a promising new tool that will assist HCPs to recognize their own well-being needs and allow health care organizations to facilitate change in policies and practices to reflect a better understanding of staff well-being."

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of scientific literature demands advanced methodologies to analyze and synthesize research trends efficiently. This paper explores the integration of complex network analysis and large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of literature analyses, focusing on the field of wearable sensors for health monitoring. Using OpenAlex as a source of scientific papers in this field, paper citation networks were constructed and partitioned into thematic clusters, revealing key subtopics such as flexible graphene-based sensors, gait analysis, and machine learning applications. These clusters, characterized by their term importance and interconnectivity, served as input for LLMs (ChatGPT) to generate structured outlines and descriptive summaries. While LLMs produced coherent overviews, limitations emerged, including superficial analyses and inaccuracies in referenced literature. The study demonstrates the potential of combining network-based methodologies with LLMs to create scalable literature reviews, albeit with limitations to be addressed concerning depth and accuracy. The analyses highlight wearable sensors’ transformative role in healthcare, driven by advancements in materials science, artificial intelligence, and device integration, while also identifying critical gaps such as standardization, biocompatibility, and energy efficiency. This hybrid approach offers a promising framework for accelerating scholarly synthesis, though today human oversight remains essential to ensure rigor and relevance."

      "abstract": "This study explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the grading and appeal resolution process in computer science education. We introduce AI-PAT, an AI-powered assessment tool that leverages LLMs to evaluate computer science exams, generate feedback, and address student appeals. AI-PAT was used to assess over 850 exam submissions and handle 185 appeal cases. Our multi-model comparison (ChatGPT, Gemini) reveals strong correlations between model outputs, though significant variability persists depending on configuration and prompt design. Human graders, while internally consistent, showed notable inter-rater disagreement, further highlighting subjectivity in manual evaluation. The appeal process led to grade changes in 74% of cases, indicating the need for continued refinement of AI evaluation strategies. While students appreciated the speed and detail of AI feedback, survey responses revealed trust and fairness concerns. We conclude that AI-PAT offers scalable benefits for formative assessment and feedback, but must be accompanied by transparent grading rubrics, human oversight, and appeal mechanisms to ensure equitable outcomes."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)–supported structural health monitoring (SHM) systems for in-service bridges using Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks, a rapidly advancing domain that merges cutting-edge sensing, communication, and data analytics to improve infrastructure safety and durability. Traditional bridge inspections and early wired SHM systems have faced persistent limitations, including manual data interpretation, latency in damage detection, and scalability barriers due to cost and complexity. Recent breakthroughs in wireless IoT technologies, multi-modal sensor fusion, and AI-based analytics now offer the potential for continuous, automated, and highly reliable monitoring of structural integrity across diverse bridge typologies and environmental conditions. To critically synthesize the state of knowledge, this systematic review analyzed 146 peer-reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2022 spanning civil engineering, computer science, and information systems. The review explored key dimensions: (a) the historical evolution and objectives of SHM in bridge engineering; (b) IoT sensor modalities and network architectures enabling large-scale monitoring; (c) AI techniques for damage classification, anomaly detection, and signal feature engineering; (d) system reliability and data integrity strategies including calibration, drift compensation, and cybersecurity; (e) deployment challenges and scalability considerations across steel and concrete bridges; (f) comparative field case studies and lessons from global smart infrastructure programs; and (g) emerging research directions such as digital twins, blockchain data provenance, climate-resilient AI, and hybrid human–AI decision systems. The findings indicate that AI-enhanced SHM significantly improves predictive damage detection, reduces false alarms, and supports timely maintenance decisions, especially when combined with multi-sensor IoT networks and robust data governance. However, challenges remain in standardization, model retraining under concept drift, cost–benefit justification for large-scale deployment, and regulatory acceptance of AI-informed safety decisions. The review also highlights knowledge gaps around extreme climate resilience, secure and scalable data management, and human oversight frameworks for trustworthy AI. By consolidating insights across 146 studies, this work provides an integrated roadmap for researchers, engineers, and policymakers aiming to advance the next generation of smart, resilient, and cost-effective bridge monitoring systems."

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining chronic disease management through the fusion of data-driven personalization, predictive analytics, and automated patient support models. This abstract integrates research on AI-based digital health assistants, structured patient support programs, and adaptive communication frameworks aimed at reducing enrollment abandonment while improving treatment persistence and long-term outcomes. AI-enabled chatbots and voice assistants synthesize multimodal data electronic health records, pharmacy claims, wearable metrics, and social determinants to generate predictive insights that anticipate adherence risks and enable personalized interventions at scale. Predictive modeling, reinforcement learning, and causal inference collectively refine outreach strategies by determining optimal communication channels, timing, and tone for each individual, thus enhancing engagement while minimizing fatigue. Natural-language understanding facilitates empathetic and culturally responsive dialogues, while large-language-model copilots streamline onboarding, benefit verification, and prior authorization processes to prevent early program drop-offs. Automation further coordinates medication refills, remote monitoring, and side-effect reporting, maintaining human oversight for clinical decision-making and emotional support. Empirical studies demonstrate that AI-augmented patient support significantly improves medication possession ratios, shortens intervention response times, and reduces hospital readmissions, leading to improved quality of life across conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, oncology, respiratory disorders, and depression. For healthcare organizations and payers, these improvements translate into enhanced value-based care performance and cost containment. Privacy-preserving analytics including federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and differential privacy safeguard sensitive data, ensuring inclusivity and equitable model performance across diverse populations. A reference framework is proposed that integrates AI-driven assistants, predictive services, and operational workflows through event-driven microservices and interoperable standards such as HL7 FHIR and OAuth 2.0. Continuous feedback loops and real-time dashboards measure adherence, persistence, and patient satisfaction while enabling dynamic recalibration of engagement models. By merging behavioral science principles with advanced machine intelligence, healthcare systems can bridge the persistent gap between prescribed care and real-world adherence, reduce enrollment abandonment, and achieve sustainable improvements in chronic disease management outcomes at scale."
