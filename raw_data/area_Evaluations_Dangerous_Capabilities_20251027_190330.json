It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50\\% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to building AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we are sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness Framework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at GPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned. We also include third-party assessments on dangerous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of GPT-4o's text and vision capabilities."

      "abstract": "Hand it to you Our ability to grab, hold, and manipulate objects involves our dexterous hands, our sense of touch, and feedback from our eyes and muscles that allows us to maintain a controlled grip. Billard and Kragic review the progress made in robotics to emulate these functions. Systems have developed from simple, pinching grippers operating in a fully defined environment, to robots that can identify, select, and manipulate objects from a random collection. Further developments are emerging from advances in computer vision, computer processing capabilities, and tactile materials that give feedback to the robot. Science, this issue p. eaat8414 BACKGROUND Humans have a fantastic ability to manipulate objects of various shapes, sizes, and materials and can control the objects’ position in confined spaces with the advanced dexterity capabilities of our hands. Building machines inspired by human hands, with the functionality to autonomously pick up and manipulate objects, has always been an essential component of robotics. The first robot manipulators date back to the 1960s and are some of the first robotic devices ever constructed. In these early days, robotic manipulation consisted of carefully prescribed movement sequences that a robot would execute with no ability to adapt to a changing environment. As time passed, robots gradually gained the ability to automatically generate movement sequences, drawing on artificial intelligence and automated reasoning. Robots would stack boxes according to size, weight, and so forth, extending beyond geometric reasoning. This task also required robots to handle errors and uncertainty in sensing at run time, given that the slightest imprecision in the position and orientation of stacked boxes might cause the entire tower to topple. Methods from control theory also became instrumental for enabling robots to comply with the environment’s natural uncertainty by empowering them to adapt exerted forces upon contact. The ability to stably vary forces upon contact expanded robots’ manipulation repertoire to more-complex tasks, such as inserting pegs in holes or hammering. However, none of these actions truly demonstrated fine or in-hand manipulation capabilities, and they were commonly performed using simple two-fingered grippers. To enable multipurpose fine manipulation, roboticists focused their efforts on designing humanlike hands capable of using tools. Wielding a tool in-hand became a problem of its own, and a variety of advanced algorithms were developed to facilitate stable holding of objects and provide optimality guarantees. Because optimality was difficult to achieve in a stochastic environment, from the 1990s onward researchers aimed to increase the robustness of object manipulation at all levels. These efforts initiated the design of sensors and hardware for improved control of hand–object contacts. Studies that followed were focused on robust perception for coping with object occlusion and noisy measurements, as well as on adaptive control approaches to infer an object’s physical properties, so as to handle objects whose properties are unknown or change as a result of manipulation. ADVANCES Roboticists are still working to develop robots capable of sorting and packaging objects, chopping vegetables, and folding clothes in unstructured and dynamic environments. Robots used for modern manufacturing have accomplished some of these tasks in structured settings that still require fences between the robots and human operators to ensure safety. Ideally, robots should be able to work side by side with humans, offering their strength to carry heavy loads while presenting no danger. Over the past decade, robots have gained new levels of dexterity. This enhancement is due to breakthroughs in mechanics with sensors for perceiving touch along a robot’s body and new mechanics for soft actuation to offer natural compliance. Most notably, this development leverages the immense progress in machine learning to encapsulate models of uncertainty and support further advances in adaptive and robust control. Learning to manipulate in real-world settings is costly in terms of both time and hardware. To further elaborate on data-driven methods but avoid generating examples with real, physical systems, many researchers use simulation environments. Still, grasping and dexterous manipulation require a level of reality that existing simulators are not yet able to deliver—for example, in the case of modeling contacts for soft and deformable objects. Two roads are hence pursued: The first draws inspiration from the way humans acquire interaction skills and prompts robots to learn skills from observing humans performing complex manipulation. This allows robots to acquire manipulation capabilities in only a few trials. However, generalizing the acquired knowledge to apply to actions that differ from those previously demonstrated remains difficult. The second road constructs databases of real object manipulation, with the goal to better inform the simulators and generate examples that are as realistic as possible. Yet achieving realistic simulation of friction, material deformation, and other physical properties may not be possible anytime soon, and real experimental evaluation will be unavoidable for learning to manipulate highly deformable objects. OUTLOOK Despite many years of software and hardware development, achieving dexterous manipulation capabilities in robots remains an open problem—albeit an interesting one, given that it necessitates improved understanding of human grasping and manipulation techniques. We build robots to automate tasks but also to provide tools for humans to easily perform repetitive and dangerous tasks while avoiding harm. Achieving robust and flexible collaboration between humans and robots is hence the next major challenge. Fences that currently separate humans from robots will gradually disappear, and robots will start manipulating objects jointly with humans. To achieve this objective, robots must become smooth and trustable partners that interpret humans’ intentions and respond accordingly. Furthermore, robots must acquire a better understanding of how humans interact and must attain real-time adaptation capabilities. There is also a need to develop robots that are safe by design, with an emphasis on soft and lightweight structures as well as control and planning methodologies based on multisensory feedback. Holding two objects in one hand requires dexterity. Whereas a human can grab multiple objects at the same time (top), a robot (bottom) cannot yet achieve such dexterity. In this example, a human has placed the objects in the robot’s hand. PHOTOS: LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS LABORATORY, EPFL Dexterous manipulation is one of the primary goals in robotics. Robots with this capability could sort and package objects, chop vegetables, and fold clothes. As robots come to work side by side with humans, they must also become human-aware. Over the past decade, research has made strides toward these goals. Progress has come from advances in visual and haptic perception and in mechanics in the form of soft actuators that offer a natural compliance. Most notably, immense progress in machine learning has been leveraged to encapsulate models of uncertainty and to support improvements in adaptive and robust control. Open questions remain in terms of how to enable robots to deal with the most unpredictable agent of all, the human."

Further progress in AI development could lead to capabilities that pose extreme risks, such as offensive cyber capabilities or strong manipulation skills. We explain why model evaluation is critical for addressing extreme risks. Developers must be able to identify dangerous capabilities (through\"dangerous capability evaluations\") and the propensity of models to apply their capabilities for harm (through\"alignment evaluations\"). These evaluations will become critical for keeping policymakers and other stakeholders informed, and for making responsible decisions about model training, deployment, and security."

      "abstract": "The quest for predictions—and a reliance on the analytical methods that require them—can prove counter-productive and sometimes dangerous in a fast-changing world. \n \n \nRobust Decision Making (RDM) is a set of concepts, processes, and enabling tools that use computation, not to make better predictions, but to yield better decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty. \n \n \nRDM combines Decision Analysis, Assumption-Based Planning, scenarios, and Exploratory Modeling to stress test strategies over myriad plausible paths into the future, and then to identify policy-relevant scenarios and robust adaptive strategies. \n \n \nRDM embeds analytic tools in a decision support process called “deliberation with analysis” that promotes learning and consensus-building among stakeholders. \n \n \nThe chapter demonstrates an RDM approach to identifying a robust mix of policy instruments—carbon taxes and technology subsidies—for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The example also highlights RDM’s approach to adaptive strategies, agent-based modeling, and complex systems. \n \n \nFrontiers for RDM development include expanding the capabilities of multi-objective RDM (MORDM), more extensive evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of RDM-based decision support systems, and using RDM’s ability to reflect multiple world views and ethical frameworks to help improve the way organizations use and communicate analytics for wicked problems."

      "abstract": "With the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), new and hard-to-predict harmful capabilities are emerging. This requires developers to be able to identify risks through the evaluation of\"dangerous capabilities\"in order to responsibly deploy LLMs. In this work, we collect the first open-source dataset to evaluate safeguards in LLMs, and deploy safer open-source LLMs at a low cost. Our dataset is curated and filtered to consist only of instructions that responsible language models should not follow. We annotate and assess the responses of six popular LLMs to these instructions. Based on our annotation, we proceed to train several BERT-like classifiers, and find that these small classifiers can achieve results that are comparable with GPT-4 on automatic safety evaluation. Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive, harmful, or biased."

      "abstract": "Clustering algorithms have been increasingly adopted in security applications to spot dangerous or illicit activities. However, they have not been originally devised to deal with deliberate attack attempts that may aim to subvert the clustering process itself. Whether clustering can be safely adopted in such settings remains thus questionable. In this work we propose a general framework that allows one to identify potential attacks against clustering algorithms, and to evaluate their impact, by making specific assumptions on the adversary's goal, knowledge of the attacked system, and capabilities of manipulating the input data. We show that an attacker may significantly poison the whole clustering process by adding a relatively small percentage of attack samples to the input data, and that some attack samples may be obfuscated to be hidden within some existing clusters. We present a case study on single-linkage hierarchical clustering, and report experiments on clustering of malware samples and handwritten digits."

      "abstract": "AI developers often apply safety alignment procedures to prevent the misuse of their AI systems. For example, before Meta released Llama 2-Chat - a collection of instruction fine-tuned large language models - they invested heavily in safety training, incorporating extensive red-teaming and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We explore the robustness of safety training in language models by subversively fine-tuning Llama 2-Chat. We employ quantized low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as an efficient fine-tuning method. With a budget of less than \\$200 and using only one GPU, we successfully undo the safety training of Llama 2-Chat models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 70B and on the Mixtral instruct model. Specifically, our fine-tuning technique significantly reduces the rate at which the model refuses to follow harmful instructions. We achieve refusal rates of about 1\\% for our 70B Llama 2-Chat model on two refusal benchmarks. Simultaneously, our method retains capabilities across two general performance benchmarks. We show that subversive fine-tuning is practical and effective, and hence argue that evaluating risks from fine-tuning should be a core part of risk assessments for releasing model weights. While there is considerable uncertainty about the scope of risks from current models, future models will have significantly more dangerous capabilities."

      "abstract": "A great diversity comes in the field of medical sciences because of computing capabilities and improvements in techniques, especially in the identification of human heart diseases. Nowadays, it is one of the world’s most dangerous human heart diseases and has very serious effects the human life. Accurate and timely identification of human heart disease can be very helpful in preventing heart failure in its early stages and will improve the patient’s survival. Manual approaches for the identification of heart disease are biased and prone to interexaminer variability. In this regard, machine learning algorithms are efficient and reliable sources to detect and categorize persons suffering from heart disease and those who are healthy. According to the recommended study, we identified and predicted human heart disease using a variety of machine learning algorithms and used the heart disease dataset to evaluate its performance using different metrics for evaluation, such as sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and classification accuracy. For this purpose, we used nine classifiers of machine learning to the final dataset before and after the hyperparameter tuning of the machine learning classifiers, such as AB, LR, ET, MNB, CART, SVM, LDA, RF, and XGB. Furthermore, we check their accuracy on the standard heart disease dataset by performing certain preprocessing, standardization of dataset, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, to train and validate the machine learning algorithms, we deployed the standard K-fold cross-validation technique. Finally, the experimental result indicated that the accuracy of the prediction classifiers with hyperparameter tuning improved and achieved notable results with data standardization and the hyperparameter tuning of the machine learning classifiers."

Building on prior work, we introduce a programme of new\"dangerous capability\"evaluations and pilot them on Gemini 1.0 models. Our evaluations cover four areas: (1) persuasion and deception; (2) cyber-security; (3) self-proliferation; and (4) self-reasoning. We do not find evidence of strong dangerous capabilities in the models we evaluated, but we flag early warning signs. Our goal is to help advance a rigorous science of dangerous capability evaluation, in preparation for future models."

      "abstract": "Current trends towards the Future Internet are envisaging the conception of novel services endowed with context-aware and autonomic capabilities to improve end users’ quality of life. The Internet of Things paradigm is expected to contribute towards this ambitious vision by proposing models and mechanisms enabling the creation of networks of “smart things” on a large scale. It is widely recognized that efficient mechanisms for discovering available resources and capabilities are required to realize such vision. The contribution of this work consists in a novel discovery service for the Internet of Things. The proposed solution adopts a peer-to-peer approach for guaranteeing scalability, robustness, and easy maintenance of the overall system. While most existing peer-to-peer discovery services proposed for the IoT support solely exact match queries on a single attribute (i.e., the object identifier), our solution can handle multiattribute and range queries. We defined a layered approach by distinguishing three main aspects: multiattribute indexing, range query support, peer-to-peer routing. We chose to adopt an over-DHT indexing scheme to guarantee ease of design and implementation principles. We report on the implementation of a Proof of Concept in a dangerous goods monitoring scenario, and, finally, we discuss test results for structural properties and query performance evaluation."

      "abstract": "Solving mobile manipulation tasks in inaccessible and dangerous environments is an important application of robots to support humans. Example domains are construction and maintenance of manned and unmanned stations on the moon and other planets. Suitable platforms require flexible and robust hardware, a locomotion approach that allows for navigating a wide variety of terrains, dexterous manipulation capabilities, and respective user interfaces. We present the CENTAURO system which has been designed for these requirements and consists of the Centauro robot and a set of advanced operator interfaces with complementary strength enabling the system to solve a wide range of realistic mobile manipulation tasks. The robot possesses a centaur‐like body plan and is driven by torque‐controlled compliant actuators. Four articulated legs ending in steerable wheels allow for omnidirectional driving as well as for making steps. An anthropomorphic upper body with two arms ending in five‐finger hands enables human‐like manipulation. The robot perceives its environment through a suite of multimodal sensors. The resulting platform complexity goes beyond the complexity of most known systems which puts the focus on a suitable operator interface. An operator can control the robot through a telepresence suit, which allows for flexibly solving a large variety of mobile manipulation tasks. Locomotion and manipulation functionalities on different levels of autonomy support the operation. The proposed user interfaces enable solving a wide variety of tasks without previous task‐specific training. The integrated system is evaluated in numerous teleoperated experiments that are described along with lessons learned."

      "abstract": "Radon is a noble gas originating from the radioactive decay chain of uranium or thorium. Most radon emanates naturally from the soil and from some building materials, so it can be found in many places around the world, in particular in regions with soils containing granite or slate. It is almost impossible for a person to detect radon gas without proper tools, since it is invisible, odorless, tasteless and colorless. The problem is that a correlation has been established between the presence of high radon gas concentrations and the incidence of lung cancer. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the exposure to radon is the second most common cause of lung cancer after smoking, and it is the primary cause of lung cancer among people who have never smoked. Although there are commercial radon detectors, most of them are either expensive or provide very limited monitoring capabilities. To tackle such an issue, this article presents a cost-effective IoT radon gas remote monitoring system able to obtain accurate concentration measurements. It can also trigger events to prevent dangerous situations and to warn users about them. Moreover, the proposed solution can activate mitigation devices (e.g., forced ventilation) to decrease radon gas concentration. In order to show its performance, the system was evaluated in three different scenarios corresponding to representative buildings in Galicia (Spain), a region where high radon gas concentrations are common due to the composition of the soil. In addition, the influence of using external hardware (i.e., WiFi transceivers and an embedded System-on-Chip (SoC)) next to the radon gas sensor is studied, concluding that, in the tested scenarios, they do not interfere with the measurements."

      "abstract": "Multi-agent systems, when enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibit profound capabilities in collective intelligence. However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors. We anticipate that our framework and observations will provide valuable insights for further research into the safety of multi-agent systems. We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/AI4Good24/PsySafe."

      "abstract": "Trustworthy capability evaluations are crucial for ensuring the safety of AI systems, and are becoming a key component of AI regulation. However, the developers of an AI system, or the AI system itself, may have incentives for evaluations to understate the AI's actual capability. These conflicting interests lead to the problem of sandbagging, which we define as strategic underperformance on an evaluation. In this paper we assess sandbagging capabilities in contemporary language models (LMs). We prompt frontier LMs, like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, to selectively underperform on dangerous capability evaluations, while maintaining performance on general (harmless) capability evaluations. Moreover, we find that models can be fine-tuned, on a synthetic dataset, to hide specific capabilities unless given a password. This behaviour generalizes to high-quality, held-out benchmarks such as WMDP. In addition, we show that both frontier and smaller models can be prompted or password-locked to target specific scores on a capability evaluation. We have mediocre success in password-locking a model to mimic the answers a weaker model would give. Overall, our results suggest that capability evaluations are vulnerable to sandbagging. This vulnerability decreases the trustworthiness of evaluations, and thereby undermines important safety decisions regarding the development and deployment of advanced AI systems."

      "abstract": "UAVs have rapidly become prevalent in applications related to surveillance, military operations, and disaster relief. Their low cost, operational flexibility, and unmanned capabilities make them ideal for accomplishing tasks in areas deemed dangerous for humans to enter. They can also accomplish previous high-cost and labor-intensive tasks, such as land surveying, in a faster and cheaper manner. Researchers studying UAV applications have realized that a swarm of UAVs working collaboratively on tasks can achieve better results. The dynamic work environment of UAVs makes controlling the vehicles a challenge. This is magnified by using multiple agents in a swarm. Resiliency is a broad concept that effectively defines how well a system handles disruptions in its normal functioning. The task of building resilient swarms has been attempted by researchers for the past decade. However, research on current trends shows gaps in swarm designs that make evaluating the resiliency of such swarms less than ideal. The authors believe that a complete well-defined system built from the ground up is the solution. This survey evaluates existing literature on resilient multi-UAV systems and lays down the groundwork for how best to develop a truly resilient system."

      "abstract": "A number of leading AI companies, including OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, have the stated goal of building artificial general intelligence (AGI) - AI systems that achieve or exceed human performance across a wide range of cognitive tasks. In pursuing this goal, they may develop and deploy AI systems that pose particularly significant risks. While they have already taken some measures to mitigate these risks, best practices have not yet emerged. To support the identification of best practices, we sent a survey to 92 leading experts from AGI labs, academia, and civil society and received 51 responses. Participants were asked how much they agreed with 50 statements about what AGI labs should do. Our main finding is that participants, on average, agreed with all of them. Many statements received extremely high levels of agreement. For example, 98% of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that AGI labs should conduct pre-deployment risk assessments, dangerous capabilities evaluations, third-party model audits, safety restrictions on model usage, and red teaming. Ultimately, our list of statements may serve as a helpful foundation for efforts to develop best practices, standards, and regulations for AGI labs."

      "abstract": "Abstract:The two Koreas have failed to produce any meaningful achievements in military confidence-building measures, arms control, and arms reduction. Moreover, South Korea’s continued competitive edge over the North in conventional weapons capability has driven North Korea to mitigate its inferiority by pursuing the dangerous course of nuclear armament. This article attempts to understand the evolving nature of military spending and the arms race on the Korean peninsula. The first section analyzes and evaluates the dynamics of military spending and the arms race. The second section empirically compares patterns of military spending between the two Koreas, while the third compares their conventional defense capabilities. The article then traces how the arms race in conventional weapons has escalated into new dimensions of military confrontation involving North Korea’s nuclearization and South Korea’s countervailing measures. Finally, the determinants of military spending and the arms race on the Korean peninsula are examined and ways are suggested to manage them."

      "abstract": "After a disaster strikes an urban area, damage to the façades of a building may produce dangerous falling hazards that jeopardize pedestrians and vehicles. Thus, building façades must be rapidly inspected to prevent potential loss of life and property damage. Harnessing the capacity to use new vision sensors and associated sensing platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would expedite this process and alleviate spatial and temporal limitations typically associated with human-based inspection in high-rise buildings. In this paper, we have developed an approach to perform rapid and accurate visual inspection of building façades using images collected from UAVs. An orthophoto corresponding to any reasonably flat region on the building (e.g., a façade or building side) is automatically constructed using a structure-from-motion (SfM) technique, followed by image stitching and blending. Based on the geometric relationship between the collected images and the constructed orthophoto, high-resolution region-of-interest are automatically extracted from the collected images, enabling efficient visual inspection. We successfully demonstrate the capabilities of the technique using an abandoned building of which a façade has damaged building components (e.g., window panes or external drainage pipes)."

      "abstract": "Abstract In the recent years, robotic systems became more advanced and more accessible. This has led to their slow, but stable integration and use in different processes and applications, including in the agricultural domain. Nowadays, agricultural robots are developed with the aim to replace the human labour in the otherwise exhausting, time-consuming or dangerous activities. Agricultural robotic systems provide many advantages, which can differ based on the type of the robot and its sensors, actuators and communication systems. This paper presents the design, the construction process, the main characteristics and the evaluation of a prototype of a small-scale agricultural robot that can be used for some of the simplest activities in agricultural enterprises. The robot is designed as an end-user autonomous mobile system, which is capable of self-localization and can map or inspect a specific farming area. The decision-making capabilities of the robot are based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which allow it to perform specific actions in accordance to the situation and the surrounding environment. The presented prototype is in its early development and evaluation stages and the paper concludes with discussions on the possible further improvements of the platform."

      "abstract": "This paper describes a novel autonomous ground vehicle that is designed for exploring unknown environments which contain sources of ionising radiation, such as might be found in a nuclear disaster site or a legacy nuclear facility. While exploring the environment, it is important that the robot avoids radiation hot spots to minimise breakdowns. Broken down robots present a real problem: they not only cause the mission to fail but they can block access routes for future missions. Until now, such robots have had no autonomous gamma radiation avoidance capabilities. New software algorithms are presented that allow radiation measurements to be converted into a format in which they can be integrated into the robot’s navigation system so that it can actively avoid receiving a high radiation dose during a mission. An unmanned ground vehicle was fitted with a gamma radiation detector and an autonomous navigation package that included the new radiation avoidance software. The full system was evaluated experimentally in a complex semi-structured environment that contained two radiation sources. In the experiment, the robot successfully identified both sources and avoided areas that were found to have high levels of radiation while navigating between user defined waypoints. This advancement in the state-of-the-art has the potential to deliver real benefit to the nuclear industry, in terms of both increased chance of mission success and reduction of the reliance on human operatives to perform tasks in dangerous radiation environments."

      "abstract": "Automated Vehicles (AVs) need to be thoroughly evaluated in order to ensure their driving capabilities. However, comprehensive evaluations are intractable due to both time and monetary costs. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive Design of Experiments (ADOE) method to evaluate the safety of AVs. Using this method, a Surrogate Model (SM) is established and updated iteratively. SM in ADOE is used to approximate the results of AV testing and help to select the next concrete scenario to be tested in each iteration. Two different ADOE approaches are proposed in this study for different testing purposes. Since the choice of the surrogate model has a profound impact on the performance of the ADOE method, 6 surrogate models were compared with two logical scenarios at different scales – a car following logical scenario and a cut-in logical scenario. Results show that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) is suitable for both ADOE approaches. And both proposed ADOE approaches achieved desired performance. Scenario-oriented ADOE made full use of each concrete scenario, capturing one collision case for every 1.12 test runs in the car following logical scenario, while SM-oriented ADOE successfully depicted the boundary between safety and danger. Using 0.46% test resources compared to enumeration, the SM-oriented ADOE found 93.9% dangerous scenarios with 90.9% precision. ADOE approaches have great potential in accelerating the evaluation of AV safety."

      "abstract": "Asthma patients may increase their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the poor prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, anti-COVID-19/asthma comorbidity approaches are restricted on condition. Existing evidence indicates that luteolin has antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immune regulation capabilities. We aimed to evaluate the possibility of luteolin evolving into an ideal drug and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. We used system pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis to assess the physicochemical properties and biological activities of luteolin and further analyze the binding activities, targets, biological functions, and mechanisms of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. We found that luteolin may exert ideal physicochemical properties and bioactivity, and molecular docking analysis confirmed that luteolin performed effective binding activities in COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. Furthermore, a protein–protein interaction network of 538 common targets between drug and disease was constructed and 264 hub targets were obtained. Then, the top 6 hub targets of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity were identified, namely, TP53, AKT1, ALB, IL-6, TNF, and VEGFA. Furthermore, the enrichment analysis suggested that luteolin may exert effects on virus defense, regulation of inflammation, cell growth and cell replication, and immune responses, reducing oxidative stress and regulating blood circulation through the Toll-like receptor; MAPK, TNF, AGE/RAGE, EGFR, ErbB, HIF-1, and PI3K–AKT signaling pathways; PD-L1 expression; and PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer. The possible “dangerous liaison” between COVID-19 and asthma is still a potential threat to world health. This research is the first to explore whether luteolin could evolve into a drug candidate for COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. This study indicated that luteolin with superior drug likeness and bioactivity has great potential to be used for treating COVID-19/asthma comorbidity, but the predicted results still need to be rigorously verified by experiments."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring of arterial pressure is important in severely obese patients who are at particular risk for cardiovascular complications. Innovative technologies for continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring are now available. In this study, we compared noninvasive arterial pressure measurements using the vascular unloading technique (Clearsight system; Edwards Lifesciences Corp, Irvine, CA) with invasive arterial pressure measurements (radial arterial catheter) in severely obese patients during laparoscopic bariatric surgery. METHODS: In 35 severely obese patients (median body mass index, 47 kg/m2), we simultaneously recorded noninvasive and invasive arterial pressure measurements over a period of 45 minutes. We compared noninvasive (test method) and invasive (reference method) arterial pressure measurements (sampling rate 1 Hz = 1/s) using Bland-Altman analysis (accounting for multiple measurements per subject), 4-quadrant plot/concordance analysis (2-minute interval, 5 mm Hg exclusion zone), and error grid analysis (calculating the proportions of measurements in risk zones A–E with A indicating no risk, B low risk, C moderate risk, D significant risk, and E dangerous risk for the patient due to the risk of wrong clinical interventions because of measurement errors). RESULTS: We observed a mean of the differences (±SD, 95% limits of agreement) between the noninvasively and invasively assessed arterial pressure values of 1.1 mm Hg (±7.4 mm Hg, −13.5 to 15.6 mm Hg) for mean arterial pressure (MAP), 6.8 mm Hg (±10.3 mm Hg, −14.4 to 27.9 mm Hg) for systolic arterial pressure, and 0.8 mm Hg (±6.9 mm Hg, −12.9 to 14.4 mm Hg) for diastolic arterial pressure. The 4-quadrant plot concordance rate (ie, the proportion of arterial pressure measurement pairs showing concordant changes to all changes) was 93% (CI, 89%–96%) for MAP, 93% (CI, 89%–97%) for systolic arterial pressure, and 88% (CI, 84%–92%) for diastolic arterial pressure. Error grid analysis showed that the proportions of measurements in risk zones A–E were 89.5%, 10.0%, 0.5%, 0%, and 0% for MAP and 93.7%, 6.0%, 0.3%, 0%, and 0% for systolic arterial pressure, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: During laparoscopic bariatric surgery, the accuracy and precision of the vascular unloading technique (Clearsight system) was good for MAP and diastolic arterial pressure, but only moderate for systolic arterial pressure according to Bland-Altman analysis. The system showed good trending capabilities. In the error grid analysis, >99% of vascular unloading technique–derived arterial pressure measurements were categorized in no- or low-risk zones."

      "abstract": "Ricin, a toxin from the plant Ricinus communis, is one of the most toxic biological agents known. Due to its availability, toxicity, ease of production and absence of curative treatments, ricin has been classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as category B biological weapon and it is scheduled as a List 1 compound in the Chemical Weapons Convention. An international proficiency test (PT) was conducted to evaluate detection and quantification capabilities of 17 expert laboratories. In this exercise one goal was to analyse the laboratories’ capacity to detect and differentiate ricin and the less toxic, but highly homologuous protein R. communis agglutinin (RCA120). Six analytical strategies are presented in this paper based on immunological assays (four immunoenzymatic assays and two immunochromatographic tests). Using these immunological methods “dangerous” samples containing ricin and/or RCA120 were successfully identified. Based on different antibodies used the detection and quantification of ricin and RCA120 was successful. The ricin PT highlighted the performance of different immunological approaches that are exemplarily recommended for highly sensitive and precise quantification of ricin."

      "abstract": "SCUBA diving activities are classified as high-risk due to the dangerous environment, dependency on technical equipment that ensures life support, reduced underwater navigation and communication capabilities all of which compromise diver safety. While autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have become irreplaceable tools for seabed exploration, monitoring, and mapping in various applications, they still lack the higher cognitive capabilities offered by a human diver. The research presented in this paper was carried out under the EU FP7 “CADDY—Cognitive Autonomous Diving Buddy”. It aims to take advantage of both human diver and AUV complementary traits by making their synergy a potential solution for mitigation of state of the art diving challenges. The AUV increases diver safety by constantly observing the diver, provides navigation aiding by directing the diver and offers assistance (e.g., lights, tool fetching, etc.). The control algorithms proposed in the paper provide a foundation for implementing these services. These algorithms use measurements from stereo-camera, sonar and ultra-short baseline acoustic localization to ensure the vehicle constantly follows and observes the diver. Additionally, the vehicle maintains a relative formation with the diver to allow observation from multiple viewpoints and to aid underwater navigation by pointing towards the next point of interest. Performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using results from pool experiments."

      "abstract": "In recent years, people are getting aware of environmental pollution which results in a growing demand for robust systems that is capable of monitoring environmental conditions in real time. An efficient air quality monitoring system is not only essential for public awareness but also has significant industrial applications. For instance, in mining and heavy industries, there is a risk of air pollution from various hazardous gases, and having an effective monitoring system could be life-saving for employees. Within the context of expensive sensor networks, challenges such as data acquisition, management, connectivity, and energy consumption is getting too high. Internet of Things (IoT) technology addresses these challenges. This study introduces an IoT-based framework designed to track environmental conditions with the help of several sensors. This system enables users to measure temperature, humidity, and the presence of dangerous gases in both indoor and outdoor settings. Data collected is stored on a web server, accessible globally via the internet. Moreover, a specially designed web application provides critical information and allows users to receive notifications for significant environmental fluctuations detected by the sensors. Compared to similar systems, our proposed solution stands out due to its affordability, precision, user-friendly interface, cloud-based architecture, and its comprehensive monitoring and data visualization capabilities. The system underwent rigorous evaluation in various scenarios, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and dependability in its performance."

      "abstract": "Highway construction work zones are hazardous environments characterized by a dynamic and limited workspace. A host of interactions between workers, passing commuter vehicles, and moving construction equipment occurs in highway work zones, fostering dangerous situations that can result in injury or death. Active strategies, such as the deployment of intrusion sensing and alert technologies in highway work zones and in transportation infrastructure construction and maintenance, can be effective at mitigating these unforeseen conditions. The main objective of this study was to conduct both conceptual analysis and experimental evaluation of intrusion sensing technologies for work zone safety. To achieve the objectives of this research, an exploratory review of the applicable technologies was conducted to identify the intrusion technologies that can be implemented for work zone safety. An objective assessment of each technology was provided based on selected evaluation metrics to elicit their capabilities. Candidate commercially available technologies were selected and evaluated using field experiments in simulated work zones. The findings of the study indicate that the commercially available technologies have the potential to enhance safety of work zone workers by providing warning alerts when hazardous situations exist. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing strategies for selecting and implementing intrusion sensing technologies for active work zone safety."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the human influence often depends on the number of followers that an individual has in his/her own social media context. To this end, the presence of fake accounts is one of the most relevant problems and can potentially have a big impact on many real life and business activities. Fake followers are dangerous for social platforms, since they may alter concepts like popularity and influence, which might yield a strong impact on economy, politics, and society. Thus, it is necessary to devise new methodologies enabling the possibility to identify and characterize fake accounts. This work presents a novel technique to discriminate real accounts on social networks from fake ones. The technique exploits knowledge automatically extracted from big data to characterize typical patterns of fake accounts. We empirically evaluated the proposed technique on the Twitter social network, and achieved significant results in terms of discrimination capabilities."

      "abstract": "The npm software ecosystem allows developers to easily import code written by others. However, manual vetting of every individual installed component is made difficult in many cases by the number of transitive dependencies brought in by installing popular packages. This has enabled attackers to propagate malicious code by hiding it deep into the dependency chains of popular packages. A particularly dangerous form of attack comes from malicious code embedded into package install scripts. We tackle the problem of preventing undesirable install-time behavior by proposing Latch, a system for mediating install-time capabilities of npm packages. Latch generates permission manifests summarizing each package's install-time behavior and checks them against user-defined policies to ensure compliance. Policies in Latch are expressed in a rich formal policy language that covers a broad range of use cases. Our key insight is that expressive Latch policies empower users to define and enforce their own individualized security needs. Evaluation of practical Latch policies on all publicly available npm packages and on a number of real-world attack packages demonstrates that our approach is effective in identifying and stopping unwanted behavior while minimizing disruption due to undesired alerts."

Due to the limited capabilities and to the sensitive nature of the devices, security assumes a crucial and primary role. In this paper, we report an innovative and extremely dangerous threat targeting IoT networks. The attack is based on Remote AT Commands exploitation, providing a malicious user with the possibility of reconfiguring or disconnecting IoT sensors from the network. We present the proposed attack and evaluate its efficiency by executing tests on a real IoT network. Results demonstrate how the threat can be successfully executed and how it is able to focus on the targeted nodes, without affecting other nodes of the network."

      "abstract": "Floods are one of the most dangerous and common disasters worldwide, and these disasters are closely linked to the geography of the affected area. As a result, several papers in the academic field of humanitarian logistics have incorporated the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for disaster management. However, most of the contributions in the literature are using these systems for network analysis and display, with just a few papers exploiting the capabilities of GIS to improve planning and preparedness. To show the capabilities of GIS for disaster management, this paper uses raster GIS to analyse potential flooding scenarios and provide input to an optimisation model. The combination is applied to two real-world floods in Mexico to evaluate the value of incorporating GIS for disaster planning. The results provide evidence that including GIS analysis for a decision-making tool in disaster management can improve the outcome of disaster operations by reducing the number of facilities used at risk of flooding. Empirical results imply the importance of the integration of advanced remote sensing images and GIS for future systems in humanitarian logistics."

      "abstract": "5G standardization is rapidly progressing and future vehicles will be connected, exchanging along the roads and on the Internet useful information for the safety of the road users. To target this goal, the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) standard starts to attract a lot of automobile industry and academic attention. The 5G Automotive Association categorizes a comprehensive list of connected vehicle applications, e.g. Advanced Driving Assistance (ADA) and Vulnerable Road User (VRU), that can have an implementation in the V2X environment. The expansion from Cloud to Edge Computing brings more processing power closer to the vehicles to guarantee the required latency and the need to have reduced network churn with continuous access to the Cloud. Edge Computing is addressing this paradigm shift by aiming to offer different services environment and cloud-computing capabilities within the roads infrastructure and the access network infrastructure in close proximity to vehicles and Road Side Units. This paper first overviews the V2X communication, in particular focusing on the ADA and VRU 5GAA use cases. Then it proposes a VRU warning system, which aims to provide an exchange information between the road users (e.g. pedestrian, cyclist, vehicles) about the presence of nearby entities in case of dangerous situation using commercial devices (i.e. smartphone) and standard compliant message. Finally, an experimental performance evaluation and comparison of the latency experienced by the client device considering firstly a Multi-Acces Edge Computing (MEC) based CAM Server and, then, a cloud-based CAM server are performed."

      "abstract": "Sufficiently capable models could subvert human oversight and decision-making in important contexts. For example, in the context of AI development, models could covertly sabotage efforts to evaluate their own dangerous capabilities, to monitor their behavior, or to make decisions about their deployment. We refer to this family of abilities as sabotage capabilities. We develop a set of related threat models and evaluations. These evaluations are designed to provide evidence that a given model, operating under a given set of mitigations, could not successfully sabotage a frontier model developer or other large organization's activities in any of these ways. We demonstrate these evaluations on Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models. Our results suggest that for these models, minimal mitigations are currently sufficient to address sabotage risks, but that more realistic evaluations and stronger mitigations seem likely to be necessary soon as capabilities improve. We also survey related evaluations we tried and abandoned. Finally, we discuss the advantages of mitigation-aware capability evaluations, and of simulating large-scale deployments using small-scale statistics."

      "abstract": "The forests in Turkey is classified and managed according to their functions within the framework of Ecosystem Based Multi-Purpose Planning policy. It is very important to ensure that planning activities are handled appropriately in order to carry out forestry activities which are labor intensive, difficult and dangerous. Forest roads have served as the main infrastructure facility for forestry activities in accordance with multiple purposes. In order to increase efficiency within the concept of precision forestry and to transfer the plans to the application more clearly, it is essential to use technology and technological machinery. In this context, this study aimed to reveal the capabilities of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tools in planning the forest road construction. For this purpose, cut and fill volume of a 300 m long sample road was computed by using USGS based Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 1 m x 1 m resolution and UAV based DEM with 0.05 m x 0.05 m resolution which were generated prior to road construction and after the road construction, respectively. The results indicated that the cut volume and fill volume were 81804.4 m 3 and 74.2 m 3 , respectively. It was found that the use of UAV will be quite advantageous in terms of capturing high quality and high-resolution data for planning the forest road construction and evaluating alternative routes."

      "abstract": "Heavy metals are one of the most hazardous pollutants in marine environments because of their bioaccumulation and biomagnification capabilities. Among them, cadmium (Cd) has been considered as one of the most dangerous for marine organisms. Here we incubated Ammonia cf. parkinsoniana specimens, a benthic foraminiferal taxon used in previous experiments, for up to 48 h in natural seawater with different concentrations of Cd to unravel the physiological change. We document a reduced pseudopodial activity of the Cd-treated specimens at concentrations >10–100 ppb in comparison with the control specimens. Moreover, confocal images of Cd-treated specimens using Nile Red as a fluorescent probe reveal an enhanced intracellular neutral lipid accumulation in the form of lipid droplets at 6 h and 12 h. This bioassay experiment allows for the direct evaluation of Cd-dose to A. cf. parkinsoniana-response relationships under laboratory controlled conditions and provides complementary information to field observations as well as to water quality guidelines and thresholds."

      "abstract": "To determine the safety of large language models (LLMs), AI developers must be able to assess their dangerous capabilities. But simple prompting strategies often fail to elicit an LLM's full capabilities. One way to elicit capabilities more robustly is to fine-tune the LLM to complete the task. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which fine-tuning-based elicitation suffices to elicit capabilities. To do this, we introduce password-locked models, LLMs fine-tuned such that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden. Specifically, these LLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a password is present in the prompt, and to imitate a much weaker LLM otherwise. Password-locked models enable a novel method of evaluating capabilities elicitation methods, by testing whether these password-locked capabilities can be elicited without using the password. We find that a few high-quality demonstrations are often sufficient to fully elicit password-locked capabilities. More surprisingly, fine-tuning can elicit other capabilities that have been locked using the same password, or even different passwords. Furthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations, are available, approaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning is an effective method of eliciting hidden capabilities of current models, but may be unreliable when high-quality demonstrations are not available, e.g. as may be the case when models' (hidden) capabilities exceed those of human demonstrators."

      "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is the base for many critical applications where a large number of nodes are deployed in the monitored field. Those nodes suffer from limited processing capabilities as well as energy. They are also required to live for a long time; sensors send their data to the sink node through multi-hop routing. The sink node is responsible for making the appropriate decision based on the received data. This shows how critical the information fusion process at the sink node. Such fusion is affected by the quality of the collected information from the deployed sensors. In addition, information handling in the WSN is also affected by environmental conditions, sensors energy, and data reliability, which play important roles in the eminence of information fusion. This paper introduces an efficient environment-aware fusion-based reliable routing algorithm named E3AF. The algorithm takes different parameters into consideration, including environmental metrics, energy consumption balance among sensor nodes, and network and data reliability. The algorithm models the environment to allow the routing algorithm to avoid going through areas marked dangerous. The paper formulates the problem into an optimization problem, which is structured as an Integer Linear programming (ILP) to help grasp and obtain the optimum solution. Furthermore, the paper presents swarm intelligence as a heuristic algorithm when the optimal solution is not possible. In comparison to EFMRP, some of the used equations were corrected, and more realistic conditions and constraints were added. With extensive experiments, the proposed algorithm is evaluated and proved its efficiency."

However, mainly due to a communication delay, complex operator interfaces and insufficient Situational Awareness (SA), the task productivity of telerobots remains inferior to human workers. This paper addresses the shortcomings of telerobots by proposing a combined approach of (i) a scalable and intuitive operator interface with gestural and verbal input, (ii) improved Situational Awareness (SA) through sensor fusion according to documented best practices, (iii) integrated virtual fixtures for task simplification and minimizing the operator’s cognitive burden and (iv) integrated semiautonomous behaviors that further reduce cognitive burden and negate the impact of communication delays, execution latency and/or failures. The proposed teleoperation system, TeMoto, is implemented using ROS (Robot Operating System) to ensure hardware agnosticism, extensibility and community access. The operator’s command interface consists of a Leap Motion Controller for hand tracking, Griffin PowerMate USB as turn knob for scaling and a microphone for speech input. TeMoto is evaluated on multiple robots including two mobile manipulator platforms. In addition to standard, task-specific evaluation techniques (completion time, user studies, number of steps, etc.)—which are platform and task dependent and thus difficult to scale—this paper presents additional metrics for evaluating the user interface including task-independent criteria for measuring generalized (i) task completion efficiency and (ii) operator context switching."

      "abstract": "Automated disinformation generation is often listed as an important risk associated with large language models (LLMs). The theoretical ability to flood the information space with disinformation content might have dramatic consequences for societies around the world. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the disinformation capabilities of the current generation of LLMs to generate false news articles in the English language. In our study, we evaluated the capabilities of 10 LLMs using 20 disinformation narratives. We evaluated several aspects of the LLMs: how good they are at generating news articles, how strongly they tend to agree or disagree with the disinformation narratives, how often they generate safety warnings, etc. We also evaluated the abilities of detection models to detect these articles as LLM-generated. We conclude that LLMs are able to generate convincing news articles that agree with dangerous disinformation narratives."

      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of patients with abdominal vascular trauma or injury requires immediate and effective decision-making in these unfavorable circumstances. The majority of these patients arrive at trauma centers in profound shock, secondary to massive blood loss, which is often unrelenting. Moreover, ischemia, compartment syndrome, thrombosis, and embolization may also be life threatening and require immediate intervention. To minimize the risk of these potentially lethal complications, early understanding of the disease process and emergent therapeutic intervention are necessary. In the literature, the management of acute traumatic vascular injuries is restricted to traditional open surgical techniques. However, in penetrating injuries surgeons often face a potentially contaminated field, which renders the placement of prosthetic grafts inappropriate. Currently, however, there are sparse data on the management of vascular trauma with endovascular techniques. The role of endovascular technique in penetrating abdominal vascular trauma, which is almost always associated with severe active bleeding, is limited. It is worth mentioning that hybrid operating rooms with angiographic radiology capabilities offer more opportunities for the management of this kind of injuries by either temporary control of the devastating bleeding using endovascular balloon tamponade or with embolization and stenting. On the other hand, blunt abdominal injuries are less dangerous and they could be treated at most times by endovascular means. Since surgeons continue to encounter abdominal vascular trauma, open and endovascular techniques will evolve constantly giving us encouraging messages for the near future."

      "abstract": "Governments should evaluate advanced models and if needed impose safety measures Great benefits to humanity will likely ensue from advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on or capable of meaningfully manipulating substantial quantities of biological data, from speeding up drug and vaccine design to improving crop yields (1–3). But as with any powerful new technology, such biological models will also pose considerable risks. Because of their general-purpose nature, the same biological model able to design a benign viral vector to deliver gene therapy could be used to design a more pathogenic virus capable of evading vaccine-induced immunity (4). Voluntary commitments among developers to evaluate biological models’ potential dangerous capabilities are meaningful and important but cannot stand alone. We propose that national governments, including the United States, pass legislation and set mandatory rules that will prevent advanced biological models from substantially contributing to large-scale dangers, such as the creation of novel or enhanced pathogens capable of causing major epidemics or even pandemics."

      "abstract": "The removal of refractory pollutants, i.e., methylene blue (MB) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), relies heavily on sorption technologies to address global demands for ongoing access to clean water. Because of the poor adsorbent–pollutant contact, traditional sorption procedures are inefficient. To accomplish this, a wheat husk biochar (WHB), loaded with cinnamic acid, was created using a simple intercalation approach to collect dangerous organic pollutants from an aqueous solution. Batch experiments, detecting technologies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the interactions at the wheat husk biochar modified with cinnamic acid (WHB/CA) and water interface to learn more about the removal mechanisms. With MB (96.52%) and CIP (94.03%), the functionalized WHB exhibited outstanding adsorption capabilities, with model fitting results revealing that the adsorption process was chemisorption and monolayer contact. Furthermore, DFT studies were performed to evaluate the interfacial interaction between MB and CIP with the WHB/CA surface. The orbital interaction diagram provided a visual representation of the interaction mechanism. These findings open up a new avenue for researchers to better understand adsorption behavior for the utilization of WHB on an industrial scale."

      "abstract": "The growing number of civil applications in which Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are involved can create many concerns for airspace security and surveillance. Gathering as much information as possible about a drone can be crucial to apply proper countermeasures if a potentially dangerous situation is detected. Of course, the presence of a UAV can be detected by radar, but it is possible to extend the system capabilities to obtain additional information. For example, in the case in which the UAV is equipped with propellers, the radar-measured rotational speed could be important information to classify the type of UAV or to reveal if it is carrying some possibly harmful payload. In addition, the rotational speed measured through radar could be used for different purposes, such as to detect a drone manumission, to estimate its maximum payload, or for predictive maintenance of the drone. Measuring the propellers’ rotational speed with radar systems is a critical task, as the Doppler generated by the rotation can be very high, and it is very difficult to find commercial radar systems in the market able to handle such a high Doppler. Another problem is caused by the typically very small Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of the propellers, which makes their detection even more difficult. In the literature, common detection techniques are based on the measurement of the Doppler effect produced by the propellers to derive their rotational speed, but due to the very limited capabilities of commercial sensors, this approach can be applied only at very low values of the rotational speed. In this work, a different approach based on a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar is proposed, which exploits the vibration of the UAV generated by the rotation of the propellers. The phenomenon and how the sensor can detect it will be presented, which is joined with a performance analysis comparing different estimation techniques for the indirect measurement of the propellers’ speed to evaluate the potential benefits of the proposed approach."

      "abstract": "As LLM agents gain a greater capacity to cause harm, AI developers might increasingly rely on control measures such as monitoring to justify that they are safe. We sketch how developers could construct a\"control safety case\", which is a structured argument that models are incapable of subverting control measures in order to cause unacceptable outcomes. As a case study, we sketch an argument that a hypothetical LLM agent deployed internally at an AI company won't exfiltrate sensitive information. The sketch relies on evidence from a\"control evaluation,\"' where a red team deliberately designs models to exfiltrate data in a proxy for the deployment environment. The safety case then hinges on several claims: (1) the red team adequately elicits model capabilities to exfiltrate data, (2) control measures remain at least as effective in deployment, and (3) developers conservatively extrapolate model performance to predict the probability of data exfiltration in deployment. This safety case sketch is a step toward more concrete arguments that can be used to show that a dangerously capable LLM agent is safe to deploy."

      "abstract": "Extensive training is crucial but challenging in certain areas such as explosive ordnance disposal. Past conflicts have shown that not only military personal but also civilians have to learn how to disarm unexploded ordnance. The preparation for dangerous situations is difficult and limited in the real world. Extended reality (XR) offers new possibilities to enhance the training of explosive ordnance disposal experts due to its immersive capabilities. This paper presents a comparative study (n = 75) of three distinct training methods: 1) Real-world (Real)-Training with a tangible replica object, 2) Virtual Reality (VR)-Training with a non-see-through Head-Mounted-Display (HMD), and 3) Mixed Reality (MR)-Training in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). All training methods are collaborative, i.e., an instructor teaches the training content to a participant in the real or virtual world. We evaluate the suitability of these approaches in terms of usability, cognitive workload, training motivation, and training success. Our results indicate that the virtual methods, VR-Training and MR-Training, provide significantly superior results in the evaluated aspects compared to the real-world training. These results can also be applied to other collaborative training methods, as the training concept of this use case was non-specific. Therefore, these virtual technologies can increase the safety of explosive ordnance disposal personnel, and we recommend establishing this in future training."

It consists of several sensors deployed on a wheelchair, able to sense pressure relief habits, activity level, vital signs, and ambient conditions. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the potential capabilities of the system and the feasibility of implementing alarms. During a period of two weeks, six full-time wheelchair users were monitored. Results show that the system is able to capture pressure relief patterns and tilt-in-space usage, a mechanism required to avoid pressure ulcers. Data analysis shows that none of the volunteers fully complied with the tilting recommendations. It also shows varied activity levels, both within and between patients, indicating their engagement in daily activities. The system is also able to estimate heart and respiration rate during passive activities (e.g., watching TV and/or resting). Also, high temperatures in summer were monitored while patients were outside, to prevent heatstroke events. All the monitored variables are acquired with unobtrusive sensors, producing no discomfort to the patient and providing valuable information for better care. The final recommendation and alarm system is implemented in a single board computer, to be embedded in the wheelchair."

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) models are scaled up, new capabilities can emerge unintentionally and unpredictably, some of which might be dangerous. In response, dangerous capabilities evaluations have emerged as a new risk assessment tool. But what should frontier AI developers do if sufficiently dangerous capabilities are in fact discovered? This paper focuses on one possible response: coordinated pausing. It proposes an evaluation-based coordination scheme that consists of five main steps: (1) Frontier AI models are evaluated for dangerous capabilities. (2) Whenever, and each time, a model fails a set of evaluations, the developer pauses certain research and development activities. (3) Other developers are notified whenever a model with dangerous capabilities has been discovered. They also pause related research and development activities. (4) The discovered capabilities are analyzed and adequate safety precautions are put in place. (5) Developers only resume their paused activities if certain safety thresholds are reached. The paper also discusses four concrete versions of that scheme. In the first version, pausing is completely voluntary and relies on public pressure on developers. In the second version, participating developers collectively agree to pause under certain conditions. In the third version, a single auditor evaluates models of multiple developers who agree to pause if any model fails a set of evaluations. In the fourth version, developers are legally required to run evaluations and pause if dangerous capabilities are discovered. Finally, the paper discusses the desirability and feasibility of our proposed coordination scheme. It concludes that coordinated pausing is a promising mechanism for tackling emerging risks from frontier AI models. However, a number of practical and legal obstacles need to be overcome, especially how to avoid violations of antitrust law."

      "abstract": "The recent evolution of edge computing favored the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) growth, opening dangerous surfaces of vulnerabilities. In this distributed sensor system scenario, due to the insecure interactions between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) networks, cyber-physical threats could lead to destructive consequences for environments and population safety. To deal with industrial cyber-physical security, modern anomaly detection systems implement innovative Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Unfortunately, current solutions still fail to provide an effective prevention to complex industrial threats. In this paper, we present KingFisher, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework based on ML. KingFisher is, to the best of our knowledge, the first solution that looks independently at IT and OT traffic, but also from sensors deployed to capture side-channel physical processes data (e.g., vibrations, background noise). Thanks to this feature, KingFisher can detect attacks that other systems would ignore. As our tests report, the correlation of inferred physical processes status with OT-network and IT-network data can give insights into suspicious and anomalous activities targeting industrial networks. For our framework, we use the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an unsupervised neural network model, to categorize data without a priori knowledge of the dataset. We evaluate the detection capabilities and performances of KingFisher in a proof of concept simulated industrial scenario under cyber-physical attacks. Our preliminary results show that KingFisher identifies attacks on both network and physical layers."

      "abstract": "The prospect of artificial intelligence (AI) competing in the adversarial landscape of cyber security has long been considered one of the most impactful, challenging, and potentially dangerous applications of AI. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to assessing AI's progress towards enabling and scaling real-world offensive cyber operations (OCO) tactics in use by modern threat actors. We detail OCCULT, a lightweight operational evaluation framework that allows cyber security experts to contribute to rigorous and repeatable measurement of the plausible cyber security risks associated with any given large language model (LLM) or AI employed for OCO. We also prototype and evaluate three very different OCO benchmarks for LLMs that demonstrate our approach and serve as examples for building benchmarks under the OCCULT framework. Finally, we provide preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate how this framework allows us to move beyond traditional all-or-nothing tests, such as those crafted from educational exercises like capture-the-flag environments, to contextualize our indicators and warnings in true cyber threat scenarios that present risks to modern infrastructure. We find that there has been significant recent advancement in the risks of AI being used to scale realistic cyber threats. For the first time, we find a model (DeepSeek-R1) is capable of correctly answering over 90% of challenging offensive cyber knowledge tests in our Threat Actor Competency Test for LLMs (TACTL) multiple-choice benchmarks. We also show how Meta's Llama and Mistral's Mixtral model families show marked performance improvements over earlier models against our benchmarks where LLMs act as offensive agents in MITRE's high-fidelity offensive and defensive cyber operations simulation environment, CyberLayer."

      "abstract": "Several jurisdictions are starting to regulate frontier artificial intelligence (AI) systems, i.e. general-purpose AI systems that match or exceed the capabilities present in the most advanced systems. To reduce risks from these systems, regulators may require frontier AI developers to adopt safety measures. The requirements could be formulated as high-level principles (e.g.'AI systems should be safe and secure') or specific rules (e.g.'AI systems must be evaluated for dangerous model capabilities following the protocol set forth in...'). These regulatory approaches, known as'principle-based'and'rule-based'regulation, have complementary strengths and weaknesses. While specific rules provide more certainty and are easier to enforce, they can quickly become outdated and lead to box-ticking. Conversely, while high-level principles provide less certainty and are more costly to enforce, they are more adaptable and more appropriate in situations where the regulator is unsure exactly what behavior would best advance a given regulatory objective. However, rule-based and principle-based regulation are not binary options. Policymakers must choose a point on the spectrum between them, recognizing that the right level of specificity may vary between requirements and change over time. We recommend that policymakers should initially (1) mandate adherence to high-level principles for safe frontier AI development and deployment, (2) ensure that regulators closely oversee how developers comply with these principles, and (3) urgently build up regulatory capacity. Over time, the approach should likely become more rule-based. Our recommendations are based on a number of assumptions, including (A) risks from frontier AI systems are poorly understood and rapidly evolving, (B) many safety practices are still nascent, and (C) frontier AI developers are best placed to innovate on safety practices."

      "abstract": "Arsenic is a well-known contaminant present in different environmental compartments and in human organs and tissues. Inorganic As(III) represents one of the most dangerous arsenic forms. Its toxicity is attributed to its great affinity with the thiol groups of proteins. Considering the simultaneous presence in all environmental compartments of other common functional groups, we here present a study aimed at evaluating their contribution to the As(III) complexation. As(III) interactions with four (from di- to hexa-) carboxylic acids, five (from mono- to penta-) amines, and four amino acids were evaluated via experimental methods and, in simplified systems, also by quantum-mechanical calculations. Data were analyzed also with respect to those previously reported for mixed thiol-carboxylic ligands to evaluate the contribution of each functional group (-SH, -COOH, and -NH2) toward the As(III) complexation. Formation constants of As(III) complex species were experimentally determined, and data were analyzed for each class of ligand. An empirical relationship was reported, taking into account the contribution of each functional group to the complexation process and allowing for a rough estimate of the stability of species in systems where As(III) and thiol, carboxylic, or amino groups are involved. Quantum-mechanical calculations allowed for the evaluation and the characterization of the main chelation reactions of As(III). The potential competitive effects of the investigated groups were evaluated using cysteine, a prototypical species possessing all the functional groups under investigation. Results confirm the higher binding capabilities of the thiol group under different circumstances, but also indicate the concrete possibility of the simultaneous binding of As(III) by the thiol and the carboxylic groups."

      "abstract": "Safety, low-cost, small size, and Artificial Intelli-gence (AI) capabilities of drones have led to the proliferation of autonomous tiny Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in many applications which are dangerous, unknown, or time-consuming for humans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have enabled au-tonomous navigation while using captured data by drone sensors as input to the model. Due to the extreme complexity of DNNs, cloud-based approaches have been highly addressed in which a drone is connected to the cloud and sends the data to the cloud, and takes the result. On the other hand, emerging tiny machine learning models and edge computing brings significant improvement in energy efficiency and latency with respect to cloud-based approaches. However, there is a trade-off in these two implementations for model accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. For instance, applying tiny machine learning models leads to lower latency but it sacrifices model accuracy in comparison to cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, we consider multiple models and introduce a new approach named MLAE2 which applies Metareasoning approach for Latency-Aware Energy-Efficient autonomous drones. Metareasoning mon-itors parameters such as latency and energy consumption for different algorithms and chooses the appropriate algorithm due to the environmental situation changes. To Evaluate our approach we extract the power consumption and latency for both cloud-based computing and edge computing while deploying multiple models on a tiny drone named Crazyflie. The experimental results show that MLAE2 successfully meets the latency constraint while maximizing model accuracy and improving energy efficiency."

Cybersecurity governance brings together all the essential elements of cyber defense and effective risk management. Without such governance, dangerous gaps persist, and assets are inevitably compromised. Given the critical decisions that need to be made in an ever-changing cyber threat environment, cybersecurity standards are a critical way for companies to ensure that their security strategy and policies are consistently and measurably implemented. The aim of this paper is to propose a capability maturity framework to assess and improve cybersecurity governance in organizations. The finding will help organizations to evaluate their cybersecurity governance capabilities."

      "abstract": "Training advanced AI models requires large investments in computational resources, or compute. Yet, as hardware innovation reduces the price of compute and algorithmic advances make its use more efficient, the cost of training an AI model to a given performance falls over time - a concept we describe as increasing compute efficiency. We find that while an access effect increases the number of actors who can train models to a given performance over time, a performance effect simultaneously increases the performance available to each actor. This potentially enables large compute investors to pioneer new capabilities, maintaining a performance advantage even as capabilities diffuse. Since large compute investors tend to develop new capabilities first, it will be particularly important that they share information about their AI models, evaluate them for emerging risks, and, more generally, make responsible development and release decisions. Further, as compute efficiency increases, governments will need to prepare for a world where dangerous AI capabilities are widely available - for instance, by developing defenses against harmful AI models or by actively intervening in the diffusion of particularly dangerous capabilities."

      "abstract": "Omics sciences are able to produce, with the modern high-throughput techniques of analytical chemistry and molecular biology, a huge amount of data. Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of diseased somatic cells, genome wide identification of regulatory elements and biomarkers, systems biology studies of biochemical pathways and gene network, and novel bioactive compounds discovery and design are examples of the great advantages that high-performance computing (HPC) can provide to omics sciences, providing a fast translation of biomolecular results to the clinical practice. \n \nMassive parallel clusters, distributed technologies such as grid and cloud computing, and on-chip supercomputing such as GPGPU and Xeon Phi devices represent well-established solutions in research laboratories, but their capabilities should be widespread by clinical and healthcare experts to reach their full potential. Additionally to compute-intensive applications, health care problems are concerned with data-intensive applications. Managing terabytes of data requires specific technologies such as redundant facilities, shared and distributed file systems, clustered databases, indexing and searching processes, and dedicated network configuration. \n \nThe aim of this special issue is to present the latest advances in the field of omics data processing with high-performance computing solutions and big data analysis paradigms, showing the potential repercussions of these technologies in translational medicine. In particular, a review paper, authored by the editors, “Managing, analysing and integrating big data in medical bioinformatics: open problems and future perspectives,” is a survey about open problems and future perspectives in the management, analysis, and integration of big data in medical bioinformatics, while the eleven selected research papers present novel concepts and important results about the application of HPC techniques in the field of computational and systems biology. \n \nRegarding the research papers, three contributions propose novel or improved implementation of parallel algorithms. C. Misale et al. in their paper entitled “Sequence alignment tools: one parallel pattern to rule them all?” are engaged in NGS and investigated the performance of the widely used alignment tools Bowtie2, BWA, and BLASR. They advocate high-level parallel programming as an alternative design strategy for next generation alignment tools. The master-worker FastFlow pattern to Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM increases the speedup for both applications and is compared to manually tuned implementations. The paper by M. W. Al-Neama et al. “An Improved distance matrix computation algorithm for multicore clusters” is concerned with an efficient implementation of distance matrix computation on multicore clusters that finds wide application in multiple sequence alignment. The implementation is mainly based on MPI and OpenMP libraries and achieves improved speedups with respect to the public parallel implementation of ClustalW-MPI. M. Aldinucci et al. in the paper entitled “On designing multicore-aware simulators for systems biology endowed with online statistics” describe a multicore aware simulation algorithm that can be applied in the field of systems biology for online statistics and data mining. The main methodology is based on the acceleration of the simulation of stochastic models and the analysis of the obtained results, where the application case relies on a general framework for the modelling of biological systems and their stochastic behaviour called calculus of wrapped compartments. \n \nThe paper by P. Cazzaniga et al. “Massive exploration of perturbed conditions of the blood coagulation cascade through GPU parallelization” belongs to the class of research on on-chip acceleration of the behaviour of biological systems in different conditions. The paper is concerned with GPU implementation of a deterministic systems biology simulator, which is applied for the exploration of perturbed conditions of the blood coagulation cascade using GPU hardware. It is based on the automatic derivation of the system of ordinary differential equations that represent the blood system in parallel. Most interesting results are obtained by one-dimensional and two-dimensional sweep of simulation parameters and achieved speedup is around 181x. \n \nThree papers discuss approaches based on the combined use of the parallel/distributed computing with the usage of GPU-based devices. The paper by G. D. Guerrero et al. “A performance/cost evaluation for a GPU-based drug discovery application on volunteer computing” discusses the benefits of volunteer computing to scale bioinformatics applications as an alternative to own large GPU-based local infrastructures. They used as benchmark a GPU-based drug discovery application called BINDSURF and the Ibercivis, which relies on BIOINC, as the reference platform. D. D'Agostino et al. in the paper entitled “Parallel solutions for voxel-based simulations of reaction-diffusion systems” present a comparison between MPI and a GPU implementation of a stochastic simulator able to consider both time and space in its simulations. This algorithm is also crowd-aware and it has been tested on a gene regulatory network, whose behaviour is influenced by both the small number of molecules involved and the conformation of the DNA in the nucleus. The paper by J. Colmenares et al. entitled “A combined MPI-CUDA parallel solution of linear and nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation” is on a combined MPI/CUDA approach for the solution of linear and nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which is very relevant to modeling the electrostatic potential generated by a system of charged particles immersed in an ionic solution. Their work is mainly based on the implementation of a full Poisson-Boltzmann solver based on a finite-difference scheme on a heterogeneous parallel system comprised of a cluster of multicores and multi-GPUs. Overall speedups of around 20x are achieved. \n \nTwo papers investigate computational biology problems that present scalability issues in their real-life application. The paper by M. Lauria “Rank-based miRNA signatures for early cancer detection” describes a new signature definition and analysis method to be used as biomarker for early cancer detection. This approach is based on the construction of a reference map of transcriptional signatures of both healthy and cancer affected individuals using circulating miRNA from a large number of subjects. T. Garcia-Valverde et al. in the paper entitled “Heart health risk assessment system: a nonintrusive proposal using ontologies and expert rules” suggest ontology and expert rules for creating a heart health risk assessment system. Available knowledge about persons gained by sensors embedded in smartphones and smartwatches allows for different levels of alerts or suggestions for the users when the intensity of the activity is detected as dangerous for their health. \n \nFinally, two papers discuss distributed approaches to large-scale computation. J. Kruger et al. in the paper entitled “Performance studies on distributed virtual screening” elaborate the performance for virtual high-throughput screening in regard to distributed computing on the example of UNICORE. They considered not only the runtime of the docking itself, but also the effort required for structure preparation. Performance studies were conducted via the workflow-enabled science gateway MoSGrid (Molecular Simulation Grid). A. Ragothaman et al. in the paper entitled “Developing eThread pipeline using SAGA-pilot abstraction for large-scale structural bioinformatics” present a cloud infrastructure for running eThread, a metathreading protein structure modelling tool for structural bioinformatics, using Amazon EC2. Authors supplied interesting insights of how continuing advances in genome sequencing technologies result in rapidly decreasing costs of experiments making them affordable for small research groups. Moreover, they present how it is possible to exploit modern cloud infrastructures to execute large-scale calculations by coordinating possibly heterogeneous virtual machine instances. \n \n \nIvan Merelli \n \nHoracio Perez-Sanchez \n \nSandra Gesing \n \nDaniele D'Agostino"

      "abstract": "The capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality content indistinguishable by humans from human-written texts raises many concerns regarding their misuse. Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluating vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently addressed by LLM developers and service providers."

      "abstract": "To operate safely, an automated vehicle (AV) must anticipate how the environment around it will evolve. For that purpose, it is important to know which prediction models are most appropriate for every situation. Currently, assessment of prediction models is often performed over a set of trajectories without distinction of the type of movement they capture, resulting in the inability to determine the suitability of each model for different situations. In this work we illustrate how standardized evaluation methods result in wrong conclusions regarding a model's predictive capabilities, preventing a clear assessment of prediction models and potentially leading to dangerous on-road situations. We argue that following evaluation practices in safety assessment for AVs, assessment of prediction models should be performed in a scenario-based fashion. To encourage scenario-based assessment of prediction models and illustrate the dangers of improper assessment, we categorize trajectories of the Waymo Open Motion dataset according to the type of movement they capture. Next, three different models are thoroughly evaluated for different trajectory types and prediction horizons. Results show that common evaluation methods are insufficient and the assessment should be performed depending on the application in which the model will operate."

      "abstract": "Abstract. Among the parts of the territory requiring periodical and careful monitoring, many have steep surfaces: quarries, river basins, land-slides, dangerous mountainsides. Aerial photogrammetry based on lightweight unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) is rapidly becoming the tool of election to survey limited areas of land with a high level of detail. Aerial photogrammetry is traditionally based on vertical images and only recently the use of significantly inclined imagery has been considered. Oblique photogrammetry presents peculiar aspects and offers improved capabilities for steep surface reconstruction. Full comprehension of oblique photogrammetry still requires research efforts and the evaluation of diverse case studies. In the present paper, the focus is on the photogrammetric UAS-based survey of a part of a large sandpit. Various flight configurations are considered: ordinary linear strips, radial strips (as the scarp considered has a semi-circular shape) and curved ones; moreover, nadir looking and oblique image blocks were acquired. Around 300 control points were measured with a topographic total station. The various datasets considered are evaluated in terms of density of the extracted point cloud and in terms of the distance between the reconstructed surface and a number of check points."

      "abstract": "Abstract This article argues that frontier artificial intelligence (AI) developers need an internal audit function. First, it describes the role of internal audit in corporate governance: internal audit evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of a company's risk management, control, and governance processes. It is organizationally independent from senior management and reports directly to the board of directors, typically its audit committee. In the Institute of Internal Auditors' Three Lines Model, internal audit serves as the third line and is responsible for providing assurance to the board, whereas the combined assurance framework highlights the need to coordinate the activities of internal and external assurance providers. Next, the article provides an overview of key governance challenges in frontier AI development: Dangerous capabilities can arise unpredictably and undetected; it is difficult to prevent a deployed model from causing harm; frontier models can proliferate rapidly; it is inherently difficult to assess frontier AI risks; and frontier AI developers do not seem to follow best practices in risk governance. Finally, the article discusses how an internal audit function could address some of these challenges: Internal audit could identify ineffective risk management practices; it could ensure that the board of directors has a more accurate understanding of the current level of risk and the adequacy of the developer's risk management practices; and it could serve as a contact point for whistleblowers. But frontier AI developers should also be aware of key limitations: Internal audit adds friction; it can be captured by senior management; and the benefits depend on the ability of individuals to identify ineffective practices. In light of rapid progress in AI research and development, frontier AI developers need to strengthen their risk governance. Instead of reinventing the wheel, they should follow existing best practices. Although this might not be sufficient, they should not skip this obvious first step."

      "abstract": "Animal–vehicle collisions cause many millions of animal deaths each year worldwide and present a substantial safety risk to people. In the United States and Canada, deer (Odocoileus spp.) are involved in most animal–vehicle collisions associated with human injuries. We evaluated a vehicle-based collision mitigation method designed to decrease the likelihood of deer–vehicle collisions during low-light conditions, when most collisions occur. Specifically, we investigated whether the use of a rear-facing light, providing more complete frontal vehicle illumination than standard headlights alone, enhanced vehicle avoidance behaviors of white-tailed deer (O. virginianus). We quantified flight initiation distance (FID), the likelihood of a dangerous deer–vehicle interaction (FID ≤ 50 m), and road-crossing behavior of deer in response to an oncoming vehicle using only standard high-beam headlights and the same vehicle using headlights plus an LED light bar illuminating the frontal surface of the vehicle. We predicted that frontal vehicle illumination would enhance perceived risk of deer approached by the vehicle and lead to more effective avoidance responses. We conducted 62 vehicle approaches (31 per lighting treatment) toward free-ranging deer over ~14 months. Although FID did not differ across treatments, the likelihood of a dangerous deer–vehicle interaction decreased from 35% of vehicle approaches using only headlights to 10% of vehicle approaches using the light bar. The reduction in dangerous interactions appeared to be driven by fewer instances of immobility (freezing) behavior by deer in response to the illuminated vehicle (n = 1) compared with approaches using only headlights (n = 10). Because more deer moved in response to the illuminated vehicle, road-crossing behavior likewise increased when the light bar was on, although these road crossings primarily occurred at FIDs > 50 m and thus did not increase collision risk. Road-crossing behavior was influenced heavily by proximity to concealing cover; deer only crossed when the nearest cover was located on the opposite side of the road. We contend that frontal vehicle illumination via rearfacing lighting has potential to greatly reduce vehicle collisions with deer and other species. Future work should explore fine-tuning the method with regard to the visual capabilities of target species."

      "abstract": "In this paper we tried to perform a classification of modern decision support systems, applied in the oil industry, the methods and approaches implemented, the tasks and problems to be decided by the oil and gas production operators, applying these methods. Keywords-decision support systems; oil industry; data mining; knowledge database disvovery; big data I. DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS CLASSIFICATION Generally, modern decision support systems (DSS) (DSS applied in oil industry are the typical ones) provide the following classification as follows. By the interaction with the user: passive, that assist in the making decision process, but are not able to propose a discrete solution; active, that participate in the correct decision making; cooperative, that propose the DSS interaction with the user. The DSS decision can be improved by the user and after transmitted back into the system for checking. The decision will be provided until it’s approved by the DSS user. On conceptual level: Communication-Driven DSS, that support the work of two or more users, proceeding the same task; Data-Driven DSS, that are targeted to access and data processing; Document-Driven DSS, that manipulate the unstructured information, stored in various electronic formats; Knowledge-Driven DSS, that provide the task solution on the basis of facts, rules, procedures. Model-Driven DSS model driven, that use the access to statistic, financial and other models during their work; they handle both internal and external data; By the application domain: • task-oriented (desktop); small range systems, suitable for a single PC installation and one user usage. These DSS are more simple than the distributed ones due to the absence of information exchange problem. The following types of task-oriented tasks are possible: the solution is automatically made by the system that consists of one node. Such system consists CPU, the system of automatic and/or manual information input and the decision performing device (the standard output device is possible). A fire extinguishing system, located on a dangerous object, can be an example of such system. the solution is made by the specialist, using the DSS. The system may include expert systems, modelling programs, the tools for results estimation and etc. distributed, that work with big data volumes and are applied by many users attached to big data storages. The DSS of the type above mentioned can be distributed on territory either by functions. Geographically and functionally distributed DSS consist of calculation nodes, linked with each other, the every single of them is able to independently solve its local tasks, but none of them possesses enough knowledge, information and resources (or some of the list) in order to solve the common problem. A common problem, they can only solve together, combining their local capabilities and coordinating private decisions taken. Functionally distributed systems consist of several expert systems (or DSS), linked by information, or installed on a single computer; • hierarchical decision support system Hierarchical computational decision support system consist of expert systems and decision support systems, connected by the nodes of a single computer network. In terms of decisionmaking the given nodes units are unequal. The simplest example of such a system a system consisting of subsystems Wi, W2, ..., Wn of the Wo subsystem of the second (higher) level. The purpose of the Wo subsystem affect the lower subsystem so as to achieve the overall goal set for the entire system. Such a system can serve as a building block in constructing more complicated systems. Objectively, there are the interests of the system as a whole. The Wo subsystem acts as their spokesman. There are also the interests of Wi, W2, ..., Wn subsystems, and their interests usually do not coincide with the interests of a subsystem Wo in whole. The degree of centralization of the system is determined by the measure of the separation of powers between the levels of the system. In cases where the Wo system can not make orders to the lower level subsystems, the subsystems of the lower level can not function without coordinating actions (for example, in the process of developing a new actions strategy or in the resources allocation), it is necessary to perform the agreed solutions International Conference on Test, Measurement and Computational Method (TMCM 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 141 Distributed DSS can have the following modifications: The decision is offered by several expert systems, situated on the same node, but estimating the situation the situation from different \"points of view\". They can offer a variety of solutions that should be corrected and approved by a specialist, sitting at the display unit; The decision is offered by several expert systems on different computing nodes of the network. Due to the fact that they can offer suitable computer solutions from different \"angles\", such solutions are to be considered by the experts from the various computing nodes. If one of the nodes passes not one but several solutions, the situation doesn’t fundamentally change; the solution is offered by the some experts, located at the displays of different computer network nodes. They all will have to reconcile the final decision. The variant, when the variety of solutions and is offered so by the expert system (s) as the expert (s), is possible, either. Despite the fact that the specific implementation of the DSS depends much on the scope, methods of solutions generation, evaluation and approval are based on the same theoretical assumptions and methods."

      "abstract": "The rapidly growing demand for vast numbers of Internet of Things (IoT), in both urban and rural areas, necessitates their ceaseless and automatic energy supply. This is particularly vital in cases where the IoT sensors are deployed in distant or dangerous locations outside human reach. In this direction, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities can address this issue, due to their flexible deployment. To this end, we devise an architecture in which a UAV swarm covers the energy demand of an IoT network, while concurrently, the UAVs fulfil their energy needs through a charging station (CS) infrastructure. A practical energy model is considered, which takes into account the UAVs’ battery level, energy consumption due to transition to different locations, hovering, and WPT. Also, to capture the UAV-CS interaction, an economic model is introduced. The UAVs aim to maximize their profit by transferring energy to the IoT, while the CSs aim to maximize their profit by recharging the UAVs. To ensure a profit-wise stable CS-UAV association, while providing energy coverage to the IoT, we formulate a many-to-one matching game. Due to inter-dependencies between UAVs’ utilities, i.e., externalities, a matching algorithm with two-sided exchange-stability is proposed. To further evaluate the considered system, we design an optimization scheme which performs the UAV-CS assignment towards maximizing the energy coverage of the IDs. Numerical results showcase the matching algorithm’s ability to provide near-optimal energy coverage to the IDs, while balancing fairness among the competing agents’ profit, compared to the optimization scheme."

      "abstract": "As the capabilities of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) advance, they will successively enter traffic. Algorithms to control CAVs require extensive testing before they can be deployed to vehicles interacting with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in mixed traffic. Testing an algorithm in simulation requires simulating human behavior, which is difficult, if not intractable. Testing in real traffic is dangerous and expensive. A scaled laboratory is a testing platform which allows testing of algorithms in controlled environments. Our Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab (CPM Lab) is such a laboratory to evaluate algorithms for CAVs. This paper presents how we incorporate a HDV in our CPM Lab. It shows how we replicate the dynamics and haptic of a real vehicle in our scaled laboratory via a steering wheel and a first-person-view. We demonstrate the capabilities of the CPM Lab with a mixed-traffic scenario composed of an HDV and several CAVs. We plan trajectories for the CAVs with prioritized distributed model predictive control and interact with the HDV using reachability analysis and responsibility-sensitive safety rules."

      "abstract": "In the domain of medical diagnostics, precise identification of various skin and oral diseases is vital for effective patient care. In particular, Mpox is a potentially dangerous viral disease with zoonotic origins, capable of human-to-human transmission, underscoring the urgency of precise diagnostic methods for timely intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach named the Choquet Fuzzy Integral-based Ensemble (CFI-Net) for accurate classification of skin diseases, with a specific emphasis on detecting Mpox, foot ulcers, and various mouth and oral diseases. Our methodology begins with Transfer Learning, enhancing the classification capabilities of base classifiers (DenseNet169, MobileNetV1 and DenseNet201) by incorporating additional layers. Subsequently, we aggregate the prediction scores from each base classifier using the Choquet fuzzy integral (CFI) to derive the final predicted labels, thus ensuring dynamic and robust predictions. Fuzzy measures, a crucial component of this fuzzy integral-based ensemble method, are typically determined through manual experimentation in previous approaches. However, in our study, we have tackled the challenge of manual tuning by employing meta-heuristic optimization algorithm to precisely configure the fuzzy measures for optimal performance. A rigorous evaluation is conducted on four publicly available datasets, encompassing two Mpox datasets, a foot ulcer dataset, and a mouth and oral disease dataset. The experiments reveal the remarkable effectiveness of CFI-Net in significantly improving disease classification accuracy. Additionally, we employ Grad-CAM analysis to provide insights into the decision-making processes of our models. Our findings underscore the exceptional performance of CFI-Net, achieving accuracy rates of 98.06% and 94.81% for Mpox detection, 99.06% for foot ulcer detection, and an impressive 99.61% for mouth and oral disease classification. This research not only contributes to the advancement of disease diagnosis but also demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning techniques coupled with fuzzy integral-based fusion in enhancing diagnostic accuracy."

      "abstract": "—PDF is the de-facto standard for document exchange. It is common to open PDF ﬁles from potentially untrusted sources such as email attachments or downloaded from the Internet. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the capabilities of malicious PDF documents. Instead of focusing on implementation bugs, we abuse legitimate features of the PDF standard itself by systematically identifying dangerous paths in the PDF ﬁle structure. These dangerous paths lead to attacks that we categorize into four generic classes: (1) Denial-of-Service attacks affecting the host that processes the document. (2) Information disclosure attacks leaking personal data out of the victim’s computer. (3) Data manipulation on the victim’s system. (4) Code execution on the victim’s machine. An evaluation of 28 popular PDF processing applications shows that 26 of them are vulnerable at least one attack. Finally, we propose a methodology to protect against attacks based on PDF features systematically."

      "abstract": "Phishing is one of the most prolific cybercriminal activities, with attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is, therefore, imperative to explore novel technologies to improve user protection across both technical and human dimensions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for text processing in various domains, but their use for defense against phishing attacks still remains scarcely explored. In this paper, we present APOLLO, a tool based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o to detect phishing emails and generate explanation messages to users about why a specific email is dangerous, thus improving their decision-making capabilities. We have evaluated the performance of APOLLO in classifying phishing emails; the results show that GPT-4o has exemplary capabilities in classifying phishing emails (97% accuracy) and that this performance can be further improved by integrating data from third-party services, resulting in a near-perfect classification rate (99% accuracy). To assess the perception of the explanations generated by this tool, we also conducted a study with 20 participants, comparing four different explanations presented as phishing warnings. We compared the LLM-generated explanations to four baselines: a manually crafted warning, and warnings from Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. The results show that not only the LLM-generated explanations were perceived as high quality, but also that they can be more understandable, interesting, and trustworthy than the baselines. These findings suggest that using LLMs as a defense against phishing is a very promising approach, with APOLLO representing a proof of concept in this research direction."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, to identify potentially dangerous situations created by pedestrians, performing video surveillance systems are more than necessary. The application presented in this paper is designed to automatically detect individual pedestrians and analyze and characterize their behavior. Based on this result, an informed security decision can be made. The implementation uses YOLO (You-Only-Look-Once) [1] to detect people in a real-time video stream and evaluates and characterizes their movement, based on data collected from the current video frame and a certain number of past video frames. A series of tests revealed that our system successfully detects both regular and irregular pedestrian trajectory type and also the type of movement: walk, run or stand. The processing speed of up to 77 FPS for YOLOv3-tiny and 21 FPS for YOLOv3 qualifies our solution for real-time operation in a surveillance system, if it is running on a computer platform equipped with a NVIDIA GPU with CUDA capabilities."

      "abstract": "This research paper is introducing the concept of AI and IoT-enabled Smart Safety Helmet for Real-Time Environmental and Health Monitoring, which is a breakthrough attempt focusing on providing safety solutions for workers in dangerous areas. Employing the AI-IoT synergy to solve the problem of monitoring the surrounding environment and the mental state of the user, our helmet significantly decreases a risk of an accident and exposure to dangerous conditions. The primary part of the study is to mount various sensors on the helmet so as to observe the realtime changes in the environmental parameters that include CO2 levels, temperature, humidity, and physical responses of the wearer as well. This sensor data is then fed into a microcontroller unit that is connected with IoT that uses this process and analyze the data to identify risks and assess risk levels. Through the IoT technology, a perfect channel for a real-time data transfer to the end-users end the centralized monitoring systems is availed, enabling an action to be taken immediately. We ran many different types of MATLAB simulations and real-world testing scenarios. Then our evaluation determined the sensors' accuracy, the efficiency of the AI model, the consumption of the power, the data transmission capabilities, and the overall usability of the helmet. This outcome not only confirms the safety and economical nature of the helmet but as well its user-centricity design which ensures its effectiveness in creating a safe working environment."

      "abstract": "The reliability enhancement of electrical machines is one of the key enabling factors for spreading the full-electric propulsion to next-generation long-endurance UAVs. This paper deals with the fault-tolerant control design of a Full-Electric Propulsion System (FEPS) for a lightweight fixed-wing UAV, in which a dual-stator Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) drives a twin-blade fixed-pitch propeller. The FEPS is designed to operate with both stators delivering power (active/active status) during climb, to maximize performances, while only one stator is used (active/stand-by status) in cruise and landing, to enhance reliability. To assess the fault-tolerant capabilities of the system, as well as to evaluate the impacts of its failure transients on the UAV performances, a detailed model of the FEPS (including three-phase electrical systems, digital regulators, drivetrain compliance and propeller loads) is integrated with the model of the UAV longitudinal dynamics, and the system response is characterized by injecting a phase-to-ground fault in the motor during different flight manoeuvres. The results show that, even after a stator failure, the fault-tolerant control permits the UAV to hold altitude and speed during cruise, to keep on climbing (even with reduced performances), and to safely manage the flight termination (requiring to stop and align the propeller blades with the UAV wing), by avoiding potentially dangerous torque ripples and structural vibrations."

      "abstract": "Floods are widespread and dangerous natural hazards worldwide. It is essential to grasp the causes of floods to mitigate their severe effects on people and society. The key drivers of flood susceptibility in rapidly urbanizing areas can vary depending on the specific context and require further investigation. This research developed an index system comprising 10 indicators associated with factors and environments that lead to disasters, and used machine learning methods to assess flood susceptibility. The core urban area of the Yangtze River Delta served as a case study. Four scenarios depicting separate and combined effects of climate change and human activity were evaluated using data from various periods, to measure the spatial variability in flood susceptibility. The findings demonstrate that the extreme gradient boosting model outperformed the decision tree, support vector machine, and stacked models in evaluating flood susceptibility. Both climate change and human activity were found to act as catalysts for flooding in the region. Areas with increasing susceptibility were mainly distributed to the northwest and southeast of Taihu Lake. Areas with increased flood susceptibility caused by climate change were significantly larger than those caused by human activity, indicating that climate change was the dominant factor influencing flood susceptibility in the region. By comparing the relationship between the indicators and flood susceptibility, the rising intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation as well as an increase in impervious surface areas were identified as important reasons of heightened flood susceptibility in the Yangtze River Delta region. This study emphasized the significance of formulating adaptive strategies to enhance flood control capabilities to cope with the changing environment."

      "abstract": "Given rapid progress toward advanced AI and risks from frontier AI systems (advanced AI systems pushing the boundaries of the AI capabilities frontier), the creation and implementation of AI governance and regulatory schemes deserves prioritization and substantial investment. However, the status quo is untenable and, frankly, dangerous. A regulatory gap has permitted AI labs to conduct research, development, and deployment activities with minimal oversight. In response, frontier AI system evaluations have been proposed as a way of assessing risks from the development and deployment of frontier AI systems. Yet, the budding AI risk evaluation ecosystem faces significant coordination challenges, such as a limited diversity of evaluators, suboptimal allocation of effort, and perverse incentives. This paper proposes a solution in the form of an international consortium for AI risk evaluations, comprising both AI developers and third-party AI risk evaluators. Such a consortium could play a critical role in international efforts to mitigate societal-scale risks from advanced AI, including in managing responsible scaling policies and coordinated evaluation-based risk response. In this paper, we discuss the current evaluation ecosystem and its shortcomings, propose an international consortium for advanced AI risk evaluations, discuss issues regarding its implementation, discuss lessons that can be learnt from previous international institutions and existing proposals for international AI governance institutions, and, finally, we recommend concrete steps to advance the establishment of the proposed consortium: (i) solicit feedback from stakeholders, (ii) conduct additional research, (iii) conduct a workshop(s) for stakeholders, (iv) analyze feedback and create final proposal, (v) solicit funding, and (vi) create a consortium."

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The resolution of variation within species is critical for interpreting and acting on many microbial measurements. In the key foodborne pathogens Salmonella and Escherichia coli, the primary subspecies classification scheme used is serotyping: differentiating variants within these species by surface antigen profiles. Serotype prediction from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates is now seen as comparable or preferable to traditional laboratory methods where WGS is available. However, laboratory and WGS methods depend on an isolation step that is time-consuming and incompletely represents the sample when multiple strains are present. Community sequencing approaches that skip the isolation step are, therefore, of interest for pathogen surveillance. Here, we evaluated the viability of amplicon sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene for serotyping Salmonella enterica and E. coli. We developed a novel algorithm for serotype prediction, implemented as an R package (Seroplacer), which takes as input full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and outputs serovar predictions after phylogenetic placement into a reference phylogeny. We achieved over 89% accuracy in predicting Salmonella serotypes on in silico test data and identified key pathogenic serovars of Salmonella and E. coli in isolate and environmental test samples. Although serotype prediction from 16S rRNA gene sequences is not as accurate as serotype prediction from WGS of isolates, the potential to identify dangerous serovars directly from amplicon sequencing of environmental samples is intriguing for pathogen surveillance. The capabilities developed here are also broadly relevant to other applications where intraspecies variation and direct sequencing from environmental samples could be valuable. IMPORTANCE In order to prevent and stop outbreaks of foodborne pathogens, it is important that we can detect when pathogenic bacteria are present in a food or food-associated site and identify connections between specific pathogenic bacteria present in different samples. In this work, we develop a new computational technology that allows the important foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica to be serotyped (a subspecies level classification) from sequencing of a single-marker gene, and the 16S rRNA gene often used to surveil bacterial communities. Our results suggest current limitations to serotyping from 16S rRNA gene sequencing alone but set the stage for further progress that we consider likely given the rapid advance in the long-read sequencing technologies and genomic databases our work leverages. If this research direction succeeds, it could enable better detection of foodborne pathogens before they reach the public and speed the resolution of foodborne pathogen outbreaks.

      "abstract": "Although exceedingly rare, shark attacks have a disproportionately large impact on human behavior, often resulting in shark culls. Due to the invasive nature of shark culls, innovating and testing non-invasive deterrent technologies that may minimize the potential for a rare negative shark encounter has become a conservation priority. One such mitigation approach is barriers, such as exclusion nets and the Sharksafe barrier. With both technologies exhibiting limitations and/or ineffectiveness (e.g., Sharksafe barrier), the development of a more effective technology was warranted. Therefore, this study had two key objectives: (1) to determine if DC 12 Volts 180 Newtons electromagnets can produce deterrent responses in the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) and (2) to determine if a newly designed and eco-friendly Exclusion barrier exhibits enhanced C. leucas deterrent capabilities when directly compared to the Sharksafe barrier. Based on 100 baited apparatus trials, electromagnetically treated baits resulted in significantly greater avoidance and reduced feeding frequencies. Furthermore, Poisson generalized linear mixed effect model analyses based on 27, 1-h trials illustrated that the Exclusion barrier region resulted in the greatest avoidance and lowest entrance and exit frequencies when compared to the control and Sharksafe barrier regions. Although the Exclusion barrier did not exclude all interacting sharks, the technology provided superior deterrent efficacy in relation to the Sharksafe barrier. Therefore, with many shark populations exhibiting precipitous declines, continued research on this novel technology on potentially dangerous shark species (e.g., white sharks—Carcharodon carcharias) and in varying ecological conditions (e.g., a high energy coastline) is warranted."

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) continue to improve and are revolutionizing the landscape of software development. These large models have demonstrated potential to generate, debug, test, analyze, document, and even translate code. Thus they are a valuable tool in the software development cycle. If used correctly, such tools can often accelerate the development cycle. Though the tools are powerful and new, the community is cautious of training using biased or sensitive data, which can lead to biased, dangerous, or incorrect outputs along with the inadvertent release of confidential information. Additionally, the carbon footprints and the un-explainability of these \"black box\" models continue to raise questions about the reliability of LLMs.With these opportunities and these challenges ahead, this paper explores the idea of \"judging\" LLM-generated code to better understand and \"open up\" the un-explainable \"black box\" models used by LLMs. We probe into the black box of one such LLM that has generated the best compiler tests for the directive-based programming models OpenMP and OpenACC in our earlier research. We challenge DeepSeek’s deepseek-coder-33B-instruct model with intentionally-erroneous code, and we also define relevant metrics and adopt an agent-based approach to evaluate the LLM and assess its capabilities as an LLM-as-a-judge. We also develop a pipeline-based approach to streamline the entire workflow. Finally, we make use of all of these strategies together to develop a more reliable method for automatically validating LLM-generated compiler tests. Based on our results, utilizing an agent-based prompting approach and setting up a validation pipeline structure drastically increased the quality of deepseek-coder-33B-instruct evaluation of tests which are used to validate compiler implementations of directive-based parallel programming models."

      "abstract": "The extensive utilization of drones has led to numerous scenarios that encompass both advantageous and perilous outcomes. By using deep learning techniques, this study aimed to reduce the dangerous effects of drone use through early detection of drones. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of deep learning approaches such as pre-trained YOLOv8 drone detection for security issues. This study focuses on the YOLOv8 model to achieve optimal performance in object detection tasks using a publicly available dataset collected by Mehdi Özel for a UAV competition that is sourced from GitHub. These images are labeled using Roboflow, and the model is trained on Google Colab. YOLOv8, known for its advanced architecture, was selected due to its suitability for real-time detection applications and its ability to process complex visual data. Hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation techniques were applied to maximize the performance of the model. Basic hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimization settings were optimized through iterative experiments to provide the best performance. In addition to hyperparameter tuning, various data augmentation strategies were used to increase the robustness and generalization ability of the model. Techniques such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and color adjustments were applied to the dataset to simulate different conditions and variations. Among the augmentation techniques applied to the specific dataset in this study, rotation was found to deliver the highest performance. Blurring and cropping methods were observed to follow closely behind. The combination of optimized hyperparameters and strategic data augmentation allowed YOLOv8 to achieve high detection accuracy and reliable performance on the publicly available dataset. This method demonstrates the effectiveness of YOLOv8 in real-world scenarios, while also highlighting the importance of hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation in increasing model capabilities. To enhance model performance, dataset augmentation techniques including rotation and blurring are implemented. Following these steps, a significant precision value of 0.946, a notable recall value of 0.9605, and a considerable precision–recall curve value of 0.978 are achieved, surpassing many popular models such as Mask CNN, CNN, and YOLOv5."

To determine whether a vehicle has been attacked, we developed a tool called the misbehavior detection system (MDS), which is intended to help the vehicle take action and minimize any potential harm from attackers. One of the most dangerous forms of attack that threaten vehicular communication systems are distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and increasing the security of VANETs against such attacks is a topic that a large number of researchers are now considering, were to provide highly effective security capabilities, machine learning (ML) techniques were applied. NSL-KDD or KDD-CUP99 datasets form the basis for the greater part of the current research. Attacks on these datasets were outdated. Therefore, we used a new dataset generated by OMNeT++, Veins, and Sumo. Two different types of attacks were conducted during this simulation, and the XGBoost classifier was used to evaluate and predict MDS systems. The median F1-score for this XGBoost classifier was 99%, which represented a clear advantage over another ML method, where we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to class balance the datasets."

      "abstract": "Abstract. Operating a helicopter in offshore wind parks with degraded visual environments from clouds or fog can endanger crew and material due to the presence of unseen obstacles. Utilizing on-board sensors such as LIDAR or radar, one can sense and record obstacles that could be potentially dangerous. One major challenge is to display the resulting raw sensor data in a way that the crew, especially the pilot, can make use of it without distracting them from their actual task. Augmented reality and mixed reality applications play an important role here. By displaying the data in a see-through helmet-mounted display (HMD), the pilot can be made aware of obstacles that are currently obscured by degraded visual conditions or even parts of the helicopter. This can be accomplished in one HMD. No attention sharing between the outside view and a head-down instrument is necessary. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is continuously aiming at testing and evaluating both flight-proof and consumer grade HMDs. One particular widely known system is the Microsoft HoloLens. DLR will integrate this low-cost HMD into their experimental helicopter. For this, as a first step, a Microsoft HoloLens was integrated into DLR’s Air Vehicle Simulator (AVES). The integration process is detailed. The simulation capabilities are described, especially for conformal, open-loop LIDAR sensor data. Furthermore, first concepts of the display format are shown, and strengths and drawbacks of the HoloLens in a cockpit environment are discussed."

      "abstract": "Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of a pilot project concerning the closure of a Forensic Psychiatric Hospital (FPH) inspired by Human Development Theory and the Capability Approach. Background: The dismantlement of the FPH of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto (Sicily Region in Italy) began in 2010 with the pilot project Luce é Libertà and ended in 2017. With the closure of six FPHs, Italy officially became the first country worldwide to close such institutions. After the closure of FPHs, some critical issues emerged, and the debate shifted to developing small-scale facilities and residences for the execution of security measures (RESM). However, few studies have provided results on the cohort of patients discharged from FPHs. Objective: Following are the objectives of this study: a) Assessing the effectiveness of the pilot project in terms of better functioning accordingly to the Classification of Functioning of Disability and Health (ICF) framework, social and labour insertion, health conditions, level of dangerousness to other, rate of readmission in forensic services, b) cost analysis, and c) describing how the CA has been applied and translated into methodological and administrative devices and concrete intervention strategies. Methods: A pre-post evaluation design was performed with a comparison between the intervention and the control group for the healthcare cost analysis. Data were collected from 2010 to 2019 at three points: T0) as a baseline, T1 and T2) for the follow-up. The instruments are a structured questionnaire, the Scale HoNOS Secure, 4 sub-scales of ICF (Activity and participation dimensions: sociality, culture, and knowledge, daily life, income, and work) (Cronbach’s Alpha from 0.76 to 0.94), and n.20 interviews with key stakeholders and beneficiaries. Results: Main results include a) the discharge of 55 patients through the use of a person-centered approach and the Personal Capability Budget (PCB), b) the expansion of substantial freedom of choice and the improvement of ICF score (t-test Sig. <, 02), c) the reduction of the risk for others and themselves (Mean Diff. -2,15 Sig. .000), d) at T2 42% of beneficiaries achieved a job placement and 36% were living in one's own home, e) at T2 the need of security measures has reduced from the initial 70% to 6.8%, and f) reduction of the healthcare costs from the fourth year onwards. Conclusion: Indications emerge to support processes of deinstitutionalisation and capabilities expansion through innovative models, a person-centered approach supported by PCBs, social finance, and social impact investments."

      "abstract": "Alcohol intoxication has a dangerous effect on human health and is often associated with a risk of catastrophic injuries and alcohol-related crimes. A demand to address this problem adheres to the design of new sensor systems for the real-time monitoring of exhaled breath. We introduce a new sensor system based on a porous hydrophilic layer of submicron silica particles (SiO2 SMPs) placed on a one-dimensional photonic crystal made of Ta2O5/SiO2 dielectric layers whose operation relies on detecting changes in the position of surface wave resonance during capillary condensation in pores. To make the active layer of SiO2 SMPs, we examine the influence of electrostatic interactions of media, particles, and the surface of the crystal influenced by buoyancy, gravity force, and Stokes drag force in the frame of the dip-coating preparation method. We evaluate the sensing performance toward biomarkers such as acetone, ammonia, ethanol, and isopropanol and test sensor system capabilities for alcohol intoxication assessment. We have found this sensor to respond to all tested analytes in a broad range of concentrations. By processing the sensor signals by principal component analysis, we selectively determined the analytes. We demonstrated the excellent performance of our device for alcohol intoxication assessment in real-time."

      "abstract": "An effective crowd management system offers immediate reactive or proactive handling of potential hot spots, including overcrowded situations and suspicious movements, which mitigate or avoids severe incidents and fatalities. The crowd management domain generates spatial and temporal resolution that demands diverse sophisticated mechanisms to measure, extract and process the data to produce a meaningful abstraction. Crowd management includes modelling the movements of a crowd to project effective mechanisms that support quick emersion from a dangerous and fatal situation. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, machine learning techniques and communication methods can be used to sense the crowd characteristic /density and offer early detection of such events or even better prediction of potential accidents to inform the management authorities. Different machine learning methods have been applied for crowd management; however, the rapid advancement in deep hierarchical models that learns from a continuous stream of data has not been fully investigated in this context. For example, Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) has shown powerful capabilities for application domains that require online learning and modelling temporal information. This paper proposes a new HTM-based framework for anomaly detection in a crowd management system. The proposed framework offers two functions: (1) reactive detection of crowd anomalies and (2) proactive detection of anomalies by predicting potential anomalies before taking place. The empirical evaluation proves that HTM achieved 94.22%, which outperforms k-Nearest Neighbor Global Anomaly Score (kNN-GAS) by 18.12%, Independent Component Analysis-Local Outlier Probability (ICA-LoOP) by 18.17%, and Singular Value Decomposition Influence Outlier (SVD-IO) by 18.12%, in crowd multiple anomaly detection. Moreover, it demonstrates the ability of the proposed alerting framework in predicting potential crowd anomalies. For this purpose, a simulated crowd dataset was created using MassMotion crowd simulation tool."

      "abstract": "Landslides are one of the dangerous gravity-driven geological hazards, endangering human life and causing extensive socio-economic and ecological damages. Determining landslide-prone hotspot zones, therefore, is vital for government agencies and local governments for mitigation studies. Lately, deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches have been employed in landslide susceptibility analyses for solving challenging problems. Notwithstanding, significant drawbacks have been reported for ML methods, including poor model variance and generalization capabilities. Therefore, DL models have often been preferred to address these limitations. The DL architecture with a separable convolution layer was proposed in this research to enhance predictive performance. The produced results revealed that the suggested DL model outperformed the ML approach by up to 9% in terms of overall accuracy, which was ascertained by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The proposed technique also indicated a substantial improvement in susceptibility map accuracy (~6%), according to the area under curve metric."

      "abstract": "In this study, the structural performance capabilities of a tempered glass guard and handrail system not reinforced with a structural framework are investigated. It is known that this cantilevered system has low redundancy and that the glass material itself is brittle. Considering these characteristics, full-scale experiments involving two (bolted and plaster-filled) connection types and two (rectangular and parallel) glass shapes of the types in frequent use as well as two (monotonic and cyclic) loading methods as three variables in total were conducted. Depending on the connection type, the stress concentration phenomenon at the point of the connection appears to be unavoidable. The final fracture mode is very dangerous and sudden such that it is necessary to control the structural safety by means of a higher margin. Specimens with a bolted connection showed inferior performance due to the brittle fracture stemming from the stress concentration phenomenon, while specimens with the plaster-filled connection exhibited excellent performance even under cyclic loading. These results therefore demonstrate that the guard and handrail system with a bolted connection should be structurally reinforced."

      "abstract": "Infrastructure inspection using unmanned aerial drones has a great potential to support complex inspection tasks especially where inspection task can be dangerous, dull or dirty. The increased number of systems in this type of inspection process makes it a very complex systems-of-systems (SoS) which is hard to assess. As a result, it becomes very difficult to satisfy all stakeholder needs and requirements. Therefore, an assessment system is required that can efficiently assess the meta-architecture of drone based inspection system. This paper presents a method to generate and evaluate systems of systems (SoS) architecture model for aerial inspection with drones. Where, a meta-architecture containing system component and a system to system interface is presented. To map the desired SoS attributes from stakeholders, different characteristics of the architecture capabilities are evaluated using some linguistic terms called key performance attributes (KPA). KPAs are combined in a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to evaluate an overall fitness value that is optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the SoS within the meta-architecture. The integrated evaluation method presented in this paper utilizes the SoS explorer to evaluate the SoS meta-architecture using synthetic parameter values."

      "abstract": "In recent years there has been substantial growth in the capabilities of systems designed to generate text that mimics the fluency and coherence of human language. From this, there has been considerable research aimed at examining the potential uses of these natural language generators (NLG) towards a wide number of tasks. The increasing capabilities of powerful text generators to mimic human writing convincingly raises the potential for deception and other forms of dangerous misuse. As these systems improve, and it becomes ever harder to distinguish between human-written and machine-generated text, malicious actors could leverage these powerful NLG systems to a wide variety of ends, including the creation of fake news and misinformation, the generation of fake online product reviews, or via chatbots as means of convincing users to divulge private information. In this paper, we provide an overview of the NLG field via the identification and examination of 119 survey-like papers focused on NLG research. From these identified papers, we outline a proposed high-level taxonomy of the central concepts that constitute NLG, including the methods used to develop generalised NLG systems, the means by which these systems are evaluated, and the popular NLG tasks and subtasks that exist. In turn, we provide an overview and discussion of each of these items with respect to current research and offer an examination of the potential roles of NLG in deception and detection systems to counteract these threats. Moreover, we discuss the broader challenges of NLG, including the risks of bias that are often exhibited by existing text generation systems. This work offers a broad overview of the field of NLG with respect to its potential for misuse, aiming to provide a high-level understanding of this rapidly developing area of research. Keywords—Natural Language Generation, NLG, Digital Deception, Survey, Taxonomy"

      "abstract": "Abstract. Safe and secure carbon dioxide (CO2) storage is likely to be critical for mitigating some of the most dangerous effects of climate change. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in activity associated with reservoir characterization and site selection for large-scale CO2 storage projects across the globe. These prospective storage sites tend to be selected for their optimal structural, petrophysical, and geochemical trapping potential. However, it has also been suggested that storing CO2 in reservoirs within the CO2 hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), characterized by high pressures and low temperatures (e.g., Arctic or marine environments), could provide a natural thermodynamic barrier to gas leakage. Evaluating the prospect of commercial-scale, long-term storage of CO2 in the GHSZ requires reservoir-scale modeling capabilities designed to account for the unique physics and thermodynamics associated with these systems. We have developed the HYDRATE flow mode and the accompanying fully implicit parallel well model in the massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport simulator PFLOTRAN to model CO2 injection into the marine GHSZ. We have applied these capabilities to a set of CO2 injection scenarios designed to reveal the challenges and opportunities for commercial-scale CO2 storage in the GHSZ.\n"

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to control robotic systems such as drones, but their risks of causing physical threats and harm in real-world applications remain unexplored. Our study addresses the critical gap in evaluating LLM physical safety by developing a comprehensive benchmark for drone control. We classify the physical safety risks of drones into four categories: (1) human-targeted threats, (2) object-targeted threats, (3) infrastructure attacks, and (4) regulatory violations. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals an undesirable trade-off between utility and safety, with models that excel in code generation often performing poorly in crucial safety aspects. Furthermore, while incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought can improve safety, these methods still struggle to identify unintentional attacks. In addition, larger models demonstrate better safety capabilities, particularly in refusing dangerous commands. Our findings and benchmark can facilitate the design and evaluation of physical safety for LLMs. The project page is available at huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/LLM-physical-safety."

The equations that describe the residual error are presented and studied in situations that model an industrial wireless scenario. We propose different voting systems and their performance is evaluated analytically and by simulations. Likewise, a voting system based on a combination of filtering and cross-checking techniques is proposed. This solution significantly reduces the probability of undetected dangerous events while maintaining availability under control. Moreover, an improved version with triple redundancy is also presented. The results demonstrate that it is possible to fulfill the requirements of standard IEC 61508 without compromising system availability statistics. The solutions have been implemented on hardware wireless prototypes to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed voting systems."

      "abstract": "Abstract UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) are commonly used in 3D (dull, dirty and dangerous) missions, because these are not endangering the operators life, while reduce maintenance costs and increase maneuvering capabilities. Despite of these advantages we should consider the possible vulnerabilities of this technology as well. Unmanned vehicles can be controlled via direct communication link, or they can work in a preprogrammed mode. Usually the preprogrammed mode is based on radio navigation systems, so we can draw a conclusion that both depend on the RF environment. In this paper I analyze a possibility to effectively evaluate the communication link of an UAS. Developers have to consider several key factors (type of operation, endurance, payload type and size, propulsion, communication link, etc.) during the development process. They are also responsible that the final product meets the predefined requirements. On the other side commercial UAS owners should have a possibility to compare and evaluate the UAS before the acquisition. Finally, operators and frequency management entities need tools to diagnose the possible sources of interference regarding the unmanned vehicles. To understand the consequences of interference in the RF spectrum we have to be able to measure the quality of the communication link in different usage scenarios. In my research I evaluate the usage of SDRs (Software Defined Radios) in RF Test and Evaluation processes. After analyzing the possibilities for a flexible testbed, I demonstrate the usability with some measurements in the GNU Radio signal processing framework."

      "abstract": "This study proposes a novel hybrid convolution and vision transformer model (ConvViT) designed to detect harmful insect species that adversely affect agricultural production and play a critical role in global food security. By utilizing a dataset comprising images of 15 distinct insect species, the suggested approach combines the strengths of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformer (ViT) architectures. This integration aims to capture local-level morphological features effectively while analyzing global spatial relationships more comprehensively. While the CNN structure excels at discerning fine morphological details of insects, the ViT’s self-attention mechanism enables a holistic evaluation of their overall configurations. Several data preprocessing steps were implemented to enhance the model’s performance, including data augmentation techniques and strategies to ensure class balance. In addition, hyperparameter optimization contributed to more stable and robust model training. Experimental results indicate that the ConvViT model outperforms commonly used benchmark architectures such as EfficientNetB0, DenseNet201, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and standalone ViT, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.61%. This hybrid approach improves accuracy and strengthens generalization capabilities, delivering steady performance during training and testing phases, thereby increasing its reliability for field applications. The findings highlight that the ConvViT model achieves high efficiency in pest detection by integrating local and global feature learning. Consequently, this scalable artificial intelligence solution can support sustainable agricultural practices by enabling the early and accurate identification of pests and reducing the need for intensive pesticide use."

Several concepts like urban drone taxi, flying boards, flying bikes, etc. are in phase of prototype system test and evaluation. As part of the modern robotization, UAVs are in the focus of attention of numerous scientists. UAVs, as special platforms are widely used by the Military in different scenarios and different flight missions. Capabilities of UAVs used in non-military applications (i.e. Police applications, disaster management applications, border control, firefighter applications, etc.) will serve well the idea of UAV 3D (Dirty-Dull-Dangerous) application. The purpose of the author is to derive those low altitude UAV flight regimes when low altitude flight automation in necessary due to flight safety aspects, or, due to any existing regulations, and, finally, find and propose flight paths of the UAV better fitting given mission of the UAV."

Raman spectroscopy is a simple highly sensitive detection operation.\nThis study was performed to obtain environmentally friendly non-POP PBDE derivatives with\nsimple detection-based molecular design and provide theoretical support for establishing enhanced\nRaman spectroscopic detection techniques.\n\n\n\nA three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3DQSAR) pharmacophore\nmodel of characteristic PBDE Raman spectral was established using 20 and 10 PBDEs as training and\ntest sets, respectively. Full-factor experimental design was used to modify representative commercial\nPBDEs, and their flame retardancy and POP characteristics were evaluated.\n\n\n\nThe pharmacophore model (Hypo1) exhibited good predictive ability with the largest correlation\ncoefficient (R2) of 0.88, the smallest root mean square (RMS) value of 0.231, and total cost of\n81.488 with a configuration value of 12.56 (˂17).74 monosubstituted and disubstituted PBDE derivatives\nwere obtained based on the Hypo 1 pharmacophore model and full-factor experimental design auxiliary.\nTwenty PBDE derivatives were screened, and their flame-retardant capabilities were enhanced and\ntheir migration and bio-concentration were reduced (log(KOW) <5), with unchanged toxicity and high\nbiodegradability. The Raman spectral intensities increased up to 380%. In addition, interference analysis\nof the Raman peaks by group frequency indicated that the 20 PBDE derivatives were easily detected\nwith no interference in gaseous environments.\n\n\n\nNine pharmacophore models were constructed in this study; Hypo 1 was the most accurate.\nTwenty PBDE derivatives showed Raman spectral intensities increased up to 380%; these were\nclassified as new non-POP environmentally friendly flame retardants with low toxicity, low migration,\ngood biodegradability, and low bio-concentrations. 2D QSAR analysis showed that the most positive\nMilliken charge and lowest occupied orbital energy were the main contributors to the PBDE Raman\nspectral intensities. Raman peak analysis revealed no interference between the derivatives in gaseous\nenvironments.\n"

      "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increase in interest in evaluating large language models for emergent and dangerous capabilities. Importantly, agents could reason that in some scenarios their goal is better achieved if they are not turned off, which can lead to undesirable behaviors. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using toy textual scenarios to evaluate instrumental reasoning and shutdown avoidance in language models such as GPT-4 and Claude. Furthermore, we explore whether shutdown avoidance is merely a result of simple pattern matching between the dataset and the prompt or if it is a consistent behaviour across different environments and variations. We evaluated behaviours manually and also experimented with using language models for automatic evaluations, and these evaluations demonstrate that simple pattern matching is likely not the sole contributing factor for shutdown avoidance. This study provides insights into the behaviour of language models in shutdown avoidance scenarios and inspires further research on the use of textual scenarios for evaluations."

      "abstract": "Accurate detection of dangerous driving behaviors is crucial for improving the safety of intelligent transportation systems. However, existing methods often struggle with limited feature extraction capabilities and insufficient attention to multiscale and contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose YOLO-AFR (YOLO with Adaptive Feature Refinement) for dangerous driving behavior detection. YOLO-AFR builds upon the YOLOv12 architecture and introduces three key innovations: (1) the redesign of the original A2C2f module by introducing a Feature-Refinement Feedback Network (FRFN), resulting in a new A2C2f-FRFN structure that adaptively refines multiscale features, (2) the integration of self-calibrated convolution (SC-Conv) modules in the backbone to enhance multiscale contextual modeling, and (3) the employment of a SEAM-based detection head to improve global contextual awareness and prediction accuracy. These three modules combine to form a Calibration-Refinement Loop, which progressively reduces redundancy and enhances discriminative features layer by layer. We evaluate YOLO-AFR on two public driver behavior datasets, YawDD-E and SfdDD. Experimental results show that YOLO-AFR significantly outperforms the baseline YOLOv12 model, achieving improvements of 1.3% and 1.8% in mAP@0.5, and 2.6% and 12.3% in mAP@0.5:0.95 on the YawDD-E and SfdDD datasets, respectively, demonstrating its superior performance in complex driving scenarios while maintaining high inference speed."

ABSTRACT At present, there are two hypotheses about the emergence of SARS-CoV-2; the first is that it was due to a naturally occurring zoonotic jump, and the second contends that it spread due to an accidental dispersion of a laboratory-acquired infection in Wuhan, China. While the pandemic’s actual origins remain occluded, it is useful to examine the latter possibility as a paradigm for evaluating biosecurity policy in the post-COVID world. While the pandemic may not have emerged from a research lab, this is possible with research on dangerous pathogens and prompts questions for biosecurity. How might biosecurity protections for such research be modernized while still enabling important, necessary public health research that utilizes dual-use or gain-of-function capabilities? As the world takes urgent action to mitigate shortcomings in the response to COVID-19, such questions and their potential solutions are vital to inform and direct future life science and technology endeavors."

      "abstract": "Operating a helicopter in off-shore wind parks in DVE from clouds or fog can endanger crew and material due to the presence of unseen obstacles. Utilizing on-board sensors like Lidar or radar one can sense and record obstacles that could be potentially dangerous. One major challenge is then to display the resulting raw sensor data in a way that the crew, especially the pilot can make use of without distracting them from their actual task. Augmented and mixed reality applications are thought to play an important role here. By displaying the data in a see-through helmet mounted display (HMD) the pilot can be made aware of obstacles that are currently obscured by degraded visual conditions or even parts of the own helicopter. This can be accomplished in one HMD. No attention sharing between the outside view and a headdown instrument is necessary. DLR is continuously aiming at testing and evaluating both flight-proof and consumer grade HMDs. One particular widely known system is the Microsoft HoloLens. DLR will integrate this low-cost HMD into their test helicopter ACT/FHS. For this, as a first step a Microsoft HoloLens was integrated into DLR's simulator AVES. In this paper the integration process is detailed. The simulation capabilities are described, especially for conformal, open-loop Lidar sensor data. Furthermore, first concepts of the display format are shown, and strengths and drawbacks of the HoloLens in a cockpit environment are discussed."

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Additive manufacturing in construction typically consists of ground-based platforms. Introducing aerial capabilities offers scope to create or repair structures in dangerous or elevated locations. The Aerial Additive Manufacturing (AAM) project has developed a pioneering approach using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV, ‘drones’) to deposit material during self-powered, autonomous, untethered flight. This study investigates high and low-density foams autonomously deposited as structural and insulation materials. Drilling resistance, mechanical, thermal and microscopy tests investigate density variation, interfacial integrity and thermal stability. Autonomous deposition is demonstrated using a flying UAV and robotic arm. Results reveal dense material at interfaces and directionally dependent cell expansion during foaming. Cured interfacial regions are vulnerable to loading parallel to interfaces but resistant to perpendicular loading. Mitigation of trajectory printing errors caused by UAV flight disturbance is demonstrated by a stabilising end effector, with trajectory errors ≤10 mm. AAM provides a significant development towards on-site automation in construction. Highlights Aerial Additive Manufacturing (AAM) releases additive manufacturing (AM) for construction applications from ground-based and tethered restraints. Multiple self-powered flying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can deposit layers of polyurethane foam in planned trajectories. High-density polyurethane foam and low-density foam can be suitable for structural and insulating layers, respectively. Laboratory tests, including drilling resistance, demonstrate the high-density of interfacial boundary regions in relation to material located away from a boundary. The challenges of reducing lateral deformation of extruded material are evaluated, and improved flight stabilisation provided by an end effector keeping trajectory errors within 10 mm is demonstrated."

      "abstract": "The article presents the results of development and research of technological schemes of planting flanges on tubular (ring) workpieces by stamping by rolling cylindrical and conical rolls. It is shown that the achievement of significant dimensions of the various elements of the workpiece is possible by providing a directed flow of metal by changing the relative position of the roll and the workpiece. Planting of external flanges is one of the most effective operations of stamping by rolling, as it allows you to form a wide range of products with advanced geometric elements. To assess the technological capabilities of the flange landing operation, the most dangerous from the destruction positions of the workpiece zone was identified and the analysis of the stress-strain state of the material using the method of grids, hardness measurement and microstructural analysis. According to the results of the research, the ways of deformation of the particles of the material of the peripheral surface of the flange in the coordinates \"intensity of deformations - an indicator of the stress state\" are schematically constructed. These deformation paths are given against the background of curves of ultimate deformations of steels, which are built on the results of uniaxial compression and torsion of cylindrical specimens and using tested approximations. A mathematical model of deformation trajectories is constructed, for which a one-parameter function is taken as a basis, which is \"glued\" from the elementary function of the sine and tangent to it at some point in the line. To determine the used plasticity resource, a damage summation model with a power approximation of the damage function was adopted. As a result, we have for the first time described the general expression of the linear damage summation model for the case of the parametric deformation path problem. The graphical representation on the constructed model of accumulation of damages in material of a dangerous zone of a flange at landing by a method of SHO is resulted. Based on the constructed model, it is possible to model the accumulation of damage by changing the values of the model parameters for different materials and deformation paths, which, in turn, depend on the relative geometric parameters of the workpiece and its location relative to the rolling roll."

      "abstract": "Autonomous driving and self-driven vehicles have become among the most pursued research areas in recent years. Nowadays, various driving tasks can be solved by applying the newest machine learning techniques such as line tracking, traffic sign recognition, automated speed adjustment, and parking. However, difficult visual conditions and anomalies can cause problems in selected algorithms, which may occur unexcepted and failure operations in these cases. It is also expected not just very expensive to do such kinds of experiments, but these problematic conditions are also lead to dangerous traffic situations at the same time. We made an effort to put these kinds of studies into a cost-effective and safe model-scale environment. This paper introduces an anomaly detection method capable of recognizing abnormal and burnt-out objects in image scenes. Our proposed method is based on a fast neural network architecture using YOLO layers to detect regions. Our experiments demonstrate the capabilities and detection accuracy of the designed neural network, called anomalyNet, with the complete training and evaluation process. In the study, we work with publicly available datasets, but our model-sized track and DAVE (University of Debrecen Autonomous VehiclE) play an important role also."

      "abstract": "Automotive head-up displays (HUDs) have the advantage of allowing drivers to keep their eyes forward while driving by superimposing visual information on top of the drivers’ forward field of view (FoV). In order to provide the intended advantage, HUDs must be designed such that they respect the characteristics and capacities of the human information processing system and accommodate the specific contexts of information use. Poorly designed HUDs indeed can adversely affect driving safety by creating new sets of problems, including visual clutter, information overload, inattentive blindness and cognitive capture (Gish and Staplin, 1995; Pauzie, 2015; Tufano, 1997; Ward and Parkes, 1994). During the last few decades, various research studies have proposed different HUD displays that present HUD information in particular styles. However, it is not well understood what type of display would be most advantageous or adequate for effectively communicating each information type and thus best serve drivers in performing the associated driving task. Relatively little research has been conducted to evaluate the available HUD displays in the interface design. As an initial effort towards addressing the knowledge gap, the objective of the current study was to provide a review of the existing HUD displays focusing on the interface design. Among the variety of HUD information types, the current review was intended to cover different types of safety information. For each type of safety information, the HUD displays proposed by the automobile industry and academic research were examined, in terms of their structures and behaviors and also related human factors display design principles. On the basis of the review results, this study suggests some future research directions that would help develop useful and effective HUD displays. This study conducted two literature searches, one for documents describing existing commercial HUD displays, and, the other one for research articles proposing or evaluating automotive HUD displays for communicating safety-related information. Thirteen major automobile manufacturers providing HUD systems, such as Audi, BMW Group, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai/KIA, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault, SAAB, Toyota, and Volvo, were considered. The details of the interface designs of the manufacturers’ HUD displays were examined using the information provided in the vehicle manuals. Research articles were searched by utilizing terms describing four concepts: (1) head-up display (head up display(s), head-up display(s), HUD(s)), (2) automobiles (automotive, vehicle(s), car(s), automobile), (3) interface design (display, design, interface, augmented reality, human factors, system), and (4) safety information (safety, warning, alert). As a result, a total of 15 studies were included in this review. The review results indicated that safety-related HUD displays proposed by academic research studies were mostly AR-based and contact-analog. On the other hand, all of the commercial safety-related HUD displays were of the unregistered type and did not utilize the AR technology. It is not clear why the existing commercial HUD displays did not adopt the AR technology. Perhaps, it may be due to some technological challenges in incorporating the AR technology into the automotive HUD system. Alternatively, it may be that the efficacy of the AR HUD technology has not been confirmed for creating safety-related HUD displays. This study examined the HUD displays in terms of the human factors display design principles (Wickens et al., 2003). Many of the proposed displays indeed were based on some of the well-known display design principles, such as the principles of proximity compatibility, information access cost minimization, predictive aiding, color coding and consistency. However, the display proposed by George et al. (2012) seemed to provide a relatively large amount of information in one display. In this case, the legibility of the display may decrease and cause confusion in terms of discriminability. In addition, visual complexity may increase, which may degrade information processing. In dangerous situations, displays should be simple and should not require too much perception or interpretation. Future research will need to determine to what degree the complexity of the display is acceptable in hazardous or safety-critical driving situations. Research is also needed to identify the individual differences in the acceptance levels of visual complexity. On the basis of the review results, some future research directions were identified: • Research should attempt to develop design principles/guidelines that help designers identify an appropriate user interface type when given an information characteristic and its usage context.  • What are the information characteristics suitable for contact-analog and unregistered display formats? Which of the two display formats would be more effective, under various circumstances, especially in situations where nearby hazards must be detected quickly? • Research is needed to investigate how to design and evaluate HUDs taking into account the drivers’ information processing capabilities under safety critical driving situations.  • How many HUD displays can be presented without exceeding the drivers’ information processing capabilities under safety-critical driving situations? In this regard, what are the priority levels of different HUD displays and how can they be determined?  • What is the acceptable level of visual complexity of a single or multiple displays within the drivers’ information processing capabilities? What are the individual differences in the acceptance levels of visual complexity?"

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence used in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight control systems tends to leave UAV control systems without any radio communication emissions, whose signatures in an electromagnetic spectrum (ES) are widely used to detect UAVs. There will be problems in the near future in detecting any dangerous threats associated with UAV swarms, kamikaze unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or any other UAVs with electrically powered thrust engines because of the UAV’s flight capabilities in full radio silence mode. This article presents a different approach to the detection of electrically powered multi-rotor UAVs. The main idea is to register the electromagnetic spectrum of the electric thrust engines of the UAV, which varies because of the changing flight conditions. An experiment on a UAV’s electric thrust engine-produced electromagnetic spectrum is carried out, presenting the results of the flight-dependent characteristics, which were observed in the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic signature of the UAV’s electric thrust engines is analyzed, discussed, and compared with the most similar behaving electric engine, which was used on the ground as a domestic electric appliance. A precision tunable magnetic antenna is designed, manufactured, and tested in this article. The physical experiments have shown that the ES of the electric thrust engines of multi-rotor UAVs can be detected and recorded for recognition. The unique signatures of the ES of the multi rotor UAV electric engine are recorded and presented as a result of the carried-out experiments. A precision tunable magnetic antenna is evaluated for the reception of the UAV’s signature. Moreover, results were obtained during the performed experiments and discussions about the development of the future techniques for the identification of the ES fingerprints of the UAV’s electric thrust engine are carried out."

      "abstract": "Detection of threat elements during dangerous land missions such as rescue operations, bomb disposal, surveillance and reconnaissance using an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) plays a significant role in technological warfare. Accurate and rapid detection of enemy arsenal and threats can help better plan and deploy military armaments while greatly reducing human casualty and economic losses. Unmanned ground systems with good maneuverability, superior wireless communication, and powerful multi-sensor and data processing capabilities can significantly advantage over the enemies. One of the key data processing tasks, i.e., land-warfare threat detection, is developed and tested in this paper. The goal is to identify and differentiate between threats in a warfare scenario. Four such threats have been defined and used to develop the detection algorithm for the study: soldiers, tanks, tents, and helicopters. Different object detection algorithms (ODAs) such as Single Shot Detector (SSD), CenterNet and Faster R-CNN based on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks were tested and compared. COCO evaluation metrics were used as performance parameters to evaluate each detection algorithm on the different threats selected. The results show that CenterNet ODA performs better in evaluation and inference when compared to other ODAs, obtaining the highest mean Average Precision of 85.89% and 93.75%, respectively, at 0.5 IoU with Resent101 V1 CNN architecture. The best trade-off between all performance parameters was obtained again using CenterNet Resent101 V1 FPN. The inference was tested on a Raspberry Pi-based UGV streamed data. It was concluded that such systems have a key role in future warfare with a strong communication system and a lighter version of ODA. Further, researchers and engineers can use the work achieved in this paper to develop robust detection and data processing models and incorporate it into various applications and domains."

      "abstract": "Dear editor COVID-19 disease is an emerging phenomenon that is spreading rapidly around the world and has caused great concern to people around the world. This epidemic has also created challenges for health services. The result of this great epidemic is the filling of hospital beds, the extreme fatigue of medical teams, the severe shortage of personal protective equipment, the infection of hospital staff, the shortage of personnel, and the spread of disease and concerns in different countries of the world. One of the challenges created during the Corona Pandemic is the reduction in the number of patients with dangerous non-covid diseases, including heart diseases, cancer, respiratory, kidney, and other diseases, referred to hospitals and medical centers. Patients with these diseases are not willing to refer to hospitals for treatment due to fear of getting infected with the coronavirus. This issue, on one hand, is one of the serious concerns of health officials regarding the health status of the people, and on the other hand, it has affected other areas of the health system, including research. Regarding the importance and status of research, there is no doubt that research is important and vital for society. Sustainable and comprehensive development in any country significantly depends on the quantitative and qualitative expansion of research activities in that country. According to the evidence, before the outbreak of coronavirus disease, some issues such as shortage of funds for research, failure of financial support for research projects, cumbersome administrative regulations (bureaucracy), lack of clear rules for evaluating research activities, and limited use of research results were among the research barriers in the country. The outbreak of Coronavirus disease has also posed research challenges. One of these challenges is the limitation of easy access to research samples. In fact, the decrease in hospitalization of patients in medical centers has made sampling difficult and limited for many studies performed in the clinical environment. Also, specialized wards of hospitals, which were the most important sampling center of most clinical trials, were changed to coronavirus wards and this also prevented access to research samples other than coronavirus samples. On the other hand, the outbreak of coronavirus disease, limited travel, and closure of dormitories have caused sampling challenges in the dissertations of graduate students. Although the coronavirus pandemic imposed many problems on all indicators of society, including public health, it was an opportunity that led to the flourishing of some capabilities in the country such as the pervasiveness and development of virtual education. During the coronavirus pandemic, the authorities became more and more aware of the importance of distance education and e-learning, and it seems that virtual education in our country has entered a new phase. The opportunity created by the virtualization of activities due to the spread of"

      "abstract": "\n Breast cancer is a major cause of patient death rates, frequently leading to life-changing repercussions even after survival is attained. This paper aims to investigate therapeutic alternatives employing nanoparticles to specifically target and treat lymphatic metastasis, which is a highly dangerous characteristic of breast cancer. This work explores the effectiveness and importance of using nanoparticle-based therapeutics to prevent the harmful consequences of breast cancer progression.\n The paper begins by discussing the progress of lymphatic metastasis and then delves into the use of nanoparticle technology in imaging techniques, diagnostic methods, and therapy tactics. This section provides detailed information on primary targeting treatments, including chemotherapy specifically targeting cancer stem cells, induction of tumour cell death, suppression of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), manipulation of the Tumour Microenvironment (TME), and improvement of the immune response. In addition, the research explores the use of nanoparticle technology in treatment plans, specifically focusing on its super magnetic capabilities and the application of gold nanoparticles, nanodiamonds, and other related qualities.\n Nanoparticle technology presents an optimistic strategy to address lymphatic metastasis in breast cancer. Nanoparticles can be used to deliver drugs or therapeutic substances directly to cancerous tumours, specifically targeting cancer cells to either destroy them or slow their growth. This strategy provides a solution for the administration of pharmaceuticals or substances that may provide challenges when delivered using conventional methods. Furthermore, nanoparticles facilitate the visualisation of tumours, aiding healthcare professionals in evaluating the severity of malignancy and formulating suitable treatment strategies.\n A comprehensive discussion has been conducted on several nanoparticles employed for inhibiting the dissemination of cancer cells from the primary organ to secondary organs. After successfully overcoming breast cancer, patients remain susceptible to post-surgical metastases in vital organs such as the lungs, brain, and bones. The advancements achieved through nanoparticle technology are highly significant. The discussion has focused on experimental evidence offered by researchers who mostly conducted studies on mice to support their findings.\n"

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nowadays, workplace violence is found to be a mental health hazard and considered a crucial topic. The collaboration between robots and humans is increasing with the growth of Industry 4.0. Therefore, the first problem that must be solved is human-machine security. Ensuring the safety of human beings is one of the main aspects of human-robotic interaction. This is not just about preventing collisions within a shared space among human beings and robots; it includes all possible means of harm for an individual, from physical contact to unpleasant or dangerous psychological effects. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, Non-linear Adaptive Heuristic Mathematical Model (NAHMM) has been proposed for the prevention of workplace violence using security Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is an area of research with a wide range of up-demands, future scenarios, and potential economic influence. HRC is an interdisciplinary field of research that encompasses cognitive sciences, classical robotics, and psychology. RESULTS: The robot can thus make the optimal decision between actions that expose its capabilities to the human being and take the best steps given the knowledge that is currently available to the human being. Further, the ideal policy can be measured carefully under certain observability assumptions. CONCLUSION: The system is shown on a collaborative robot and is compared to a state of the art security system. The device is experimentally demonstrated. The new system is being evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively."

      "abstract": "Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a dangerous exploitation technique which can be used to bypass modern defense mechanisms. ROP reuses code chunks ending with control transfer instruction from a program binary to form a chain corresponding some payload. These code chunks are called gadgets. Though, a certain set of gadgets should be available to exploit a vulnerability. Determining gadgets that can be used to form a ROP chain can be done by gadgets search and classification. This paper introduces a method for ROP gadgets classification that allows one to evaluate whether or not ROP technique can be used to exploit a program vulnerability. Classification is based on side-effects analysis of gadget execution with concrete inputs. Gadget instructions are translated into IR which is interpreted to track registers and memory usage. Initial registers and memory values are randomly generated. According to initial and final values of registers and memory gadget semantics can be explored. Classification performs several executions to determine gadget semantics. Proposed method is applied to program binaries and its capabilities were demonstrated on 32-bit and 64-bit binaries from Ubuntu 14.04. Using classification results program exploitability was confirmed for several examples. Furthermore, a possible exploitation of stack buffer overflow vulnerability in presence of write-what-where condition was shown on a model example demonstrating a bypass of canary, DEP and ASLR."

We introduce VERI, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 200 synthetic images (100 contrastive pairs) and an additional 50 real-world images (25 pairs) for validation. Each emergency scene is paired with a visually similar but safe counterpart through human verification. Using a two-stage evaluation protocol (risk identification and emergency response), we assess 17 VLMs across medical emergencies, accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals an\"overreaction problem\": models achieve high recall (70-100%) but suffer from low precision, misclassifying 31-96% of safe situations as dangerous. Seven safe scenarios were universally misclassified by all models. This\"better-safe-than-sorry\"bias stems from contextual overinterpretation (88-98% of errors). Both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm these systematic patterns, challenging VLM reliability in safety-critical applications. Addressing this requires enhanced contextual reasoning in ambiguous visual situations."

      "abstract": "This paper explains the project development of a smart mosquito trap prototype that functioned to control and protect the environment from mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are harmful insects that carry diseases, which sometimes dangerous and can kill human lives. It is very important to be able to trap and also analyze the quantity of mosquitoes in order to determine the step that should be taken to prevent the transmission of diseases. Besides that, a mosquito trap that is implemented with remote transmittance of data could be extremely useful, as it would not only reduce the amount of diseases but also provide real-time data of the trapped mosquitoes. The current mosquitoes trap in the market does not integrate the Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. The developed prototype trap was designed with the novel capability of sensing the nearby mosquitoes and transmitted the collected real-time data of the average number of trapped mosquitoes to the Favoriot IoT cloud platform for remote monitoring. Performance evaluation of the prototype was carried out on the university campus for 24 hours. The result shows that the prototype has successfully trapped a lot of mosquitoes and provided the real-time analytics data of the number of trapped mosquitoes."

      "abstract": "This research is devoted to studying the views of fans of detective and fantasy media products about security in general and about the security subject in particular. It has been suggested that the preference for media products of the fantasy and detective genres contributes to the specification of representations about the security subject. The study was carried out using the semantic differential method with the participation of 400 subjects aged 18 to 22 years. Highlighted significant differences in the structure of ideas about the subject of security among fans of detective fiction and fantasy fans: if from the point of view of the first behavior and actions of the subject security must be based on a realistic assessment of the situation of danger and actualize their own resources, the main qualities of the subject security from the standpoint of the latter are flexibility of thinking, the ability to change behavior, ability to communicate with people, while maintaining the confidentiality of the received information (factor “variability”, “privacy”, “openness”). Common to both groups of subjects are such qualities inherent in the subject of safety as originality of approach to solving a difficult or dangerous situation and energy, activity of actions (factors “novelty” and “activity”). The proposed projective method of evaluating the strategies of the subject’s actions in the conditions of threat, risk and stress expands the diagnostic and predictive capabilities of security psychology."

      "abstract": "The integration of robots into social environments necessitates their ability to interpret human intentions and anticipate potential outcomes accurately. This capability is particularly crucial for social robots designed for human care, as they may encounter situations that pose significant risks to individuals, such as undetected obstacles in their path. These hazards must be identified and mitigated promptly to ensure human safety. This paper delves into the artificial theory of mind (ATM) approach to inferring and interpreting human intentions within human–robot interaction. We propose a novel algorithm that detects potentially hazardous situations for humans and selects appropriate robotic actions to eliminate these dangers in real time. Our methodology employs a simulation-based approach to ATM, incorporating a “like-me” policy to assign intentions and actions to human subjects. This strategy enables the robot to detect risks and act with a high success rate, even under time-constrained circumstances. The algorithm was seamlessly integrated into an existing robotics cognitive architecture, enhancing its social interaction and risk mitigation capabilities. To evaluate the robustness, precision, and real-time responsiveness of our implementation, we conducted a series of three experiments: (i) A fully simulated scenario to assess the algorithm’s performance in a controlled environment; (ii) A human-in-the-loop hybrid configuration to test the system’s adaptability to real-time human input; and (iii) A real-world scenario to validate the algorithm’s effectiveness in practical applications. These experiments provided comprehensive insights into the algorithm’s performance across various conditions, demonstrating its potential for improving the safety and efficacy of social robots in human care settings. Our findings contribute to the growing research on social robotics and artificial intelligence, offering a promising approach to enhancing human–robot interaction in potentially hazardous environments. Future work may explore the scalability of this algorithm to more complex scenarios and its integration with other advanced robotic systems."

      "abstract": "Due to the widespread use of LLMs and the rising critical ethical and safety concerns, LLM unlearning methods have been developed to remove harmful knowledge and undesirable capabilities. In this context, evaluations are mostly based on single-value metrics such as QA accuracy. However, these metrics often fail to capture the nuanced retention of harmful knowledge components, making it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of unlearning. To address this issue, we propose UNCD (UNlearning evaluation via Cognitive Diagnosis), a novel framework that leverages Cognitive Diagnosis Modeling for fine-grained evaluation of LLM unlearning. Our dedicated benchmark, UNCD-Cyber, provides a detailed assessment of the removal of dangerous capabilities. Moreover, we introduce UNCD-Agent, which refines unlearning by diagnosing knowledge remnants and generating targeted unlearning data. Extensive experiments across eight unlearning methods and two base models demonstrate that UNCD not only enhances evaluation but also effectively facilitates the removal of harmful LLM abilities."

      "abstract": "Urban fire accident is a common dangerous accident in urban sudden accidents, which threatens the safety of people’s lives and property. For this reason, in recent years, all cities have incorporated the prevention and emergency management of urban fire accidents into their urban development planning, and actively improved their fire accident emergency management capabilities. However, how to evaluate the urban fire accident emergency management capacity of each city to ensure that people’s lives and property are protected to the greatest extent is an urgent problem to be considered and solved. Therefore, this paper defines a class of probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic Heronian mean (PDHLHM) operator, probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic Power Heronian mean (PDHLPHM) operators, and their dual operators that can reflect the relationship between two attributes during aggregation. Taking urban fire accident risk monitoring and early warning capability, fire infrastructure and communication system, fire-fighting and rescue capability, recovery and reconstruction capability as evaluation attributes, the probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic weight Power Heronian mean (PDHLWPHM) operator model and the probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic weight Power geometric Heronian mean (PDHLWPGHM) operator model are constructed for group decision-making. In addition, the idempotence, boundedness and monotonicity of these operators are studied, and the sensitivity of the parameters involved in the operator model is analyzed. Finally, the new model proposed in this paper is compared with the existing model to verify its scientificity."

Adding semantics to the reconstructed virtual objects is important to possibly reproduce training scenarios that otherwise could demand significant resources or happen in dangerous scenarios in some cases. The aim of this work is to evaluate the usability of authoring object component behaviors in immersive and non-immersive approaches. Therefore, we present an evaluation of the perceived ease of use to author moving parts of objects under three different conditions: desktop, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). This paper provides insights into the perceived benefits and issues that domain experts might encounter when authoring geometrical component behaviors across each interface. A within-subject study is the major contribution of this work, from which is presented an analysis based on the usability, workload and user interface preferences of participants in the study. To reduce confounding variables in the study, we ensured that the virtual objects and the environment used for the evaluation were digital twins of the real objects and the environment that the experiment took place in. Results show that the desktop interface was perceived as more efficient and easier to use based on usability and workload measures. The desktop was preferred for performing component selection but no difference was found in the preference for defining a behavior and visualizing it. Based on these results, a set of recommendations and future directions are provided to achieve a more usable, immersive authoring experience."

      "abstract": "Background and aim: Occupational stress occurs when there is a disequilibrium between job demands and capabilities. Being employed as a security guard exposes the subject to potentially dangerous situations. Security guards are engaged in a profession that confronts violators of the law as well as violence and thus are more likely to be exposed to traumatic experiences. So it is very important to assess the level of stress they possess and make them aware of the harmful effects and how to manage it. Hence, there is a need to assess the level of occupational stress and to evaluate the effectiveness of PTP on knowledge regarding occupational stress and its management among security guards of a selected organization, Shimoga, Karnataka. Results: Demonstrated that the majority of the security guards were having a moderate level of occupational stress. Among 80 security guards, 59 (74%) were having a moderate level of occupational stress, 21 (26%) were having a severe level of occupational stress and none of them possessed a mild level of occupational stress. Conclusion: This study contributes to the emerging body of knowledge about occupational stress in their security profession and it is important to plan the healthy coping strategies to cope up with their occupational stress."

      "abstract": "We present a quantitative model for tracking dangerous AI capabilities over time. Our goal is to help the policy and research community visualise how dangerous capability testing can give us an early warning about approaching AI risks. We first use the model to provide a novel introduction to dangerous capability testing and how this testing can directly inform policy. Decision makers in AI labs and government often set policy that is sensitive to the estimated danger of AI systems, and may wish to set policies that condition on the crossing of a set threshold for danger. The model helps us to reason about these policy choices. We then run simulations to illustrate how we might fail to test for dangerous capabilities. To summarise, failures in dangerous capability testing may manifest in two ways: higher bias in our estimates of AI danger, or larger lags in threshold monitoring. We highlight two drivers of these failure modes: uncertainty around dynamics in AI capabilities and competition between frontier AI labs. Effective AI policy demands that we address these failure modes and their drivers. Even if the optimal targeting of resources is challenging, we show how delays in testing can harm AI policy. We offer preliminary recommendations for building an effective testing ecosystem for dangerous capabilities and advise on a research agenda."

      "abstract": "\n <p>With the combination of diverse remote sensing data, one can estimate the detection capabilities of gravitational mass movement dynamics and behaviour. Recent multispectral satellite sensors such as Sentinel-2, RapidEye and PlanetScope offer unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions, hence reducing data gaps of alpine meteorological constraints. In addition to this data, very high resolution and accurate UAV images cover a broad range of spatial resolutions. The strengths of these remote sensing systems allow the data compilation of vast, difficult and dangerous to access mountain areas. However, the limitations of the spatiotemporal resolution for (i)&#160;pre-event landslide detection, (ii) monitoring of already known mass movements and (iii) the capability to measure rapid changes (e.g. &#160;accelerations) for warnings have not been examined extensively. Thus, there is an important need to understand the potential of multispectral images to detect, monitor, and identify rapid changes prior to landslide events to increase the forecasting window.</p><p>Digital image correlation (DIC), as indispensable tool to measure surface displacements, aids in estimating the fitness of different remote sensing images. Here, we present first results of motion delineation by DIC of the Sattelkar, a high-alpine, deglaciated and debris-laden cirque in the Obersulzbach-valley, Austria. We used comprehensive knowledge of the study site to thoroughly understand DIC motion clusters for verification purposes. We then compared three different DIC software tools, COSI-Corr, DIC&#8209;FFT and IMCORR. They revealed similar results for the three satellite systems in terms of hot spot areas as well as noise. Our findings show large motion inaccuracies for Sentinel-2, RapidEye and PlanetScope images due to spatial resolution, poor image co-registration and changing data quality. In contrast, displacement patterns from the three UAV images (7/2018, 7/2019, 9/2019) demonstrate good positional accuracy as well as data usability for this approach. The inherited noise results from decorrelation due to high velocities suggest using an increased temporal image acquisition for further evaluation.</p><p>Reliable, precise results for landslide detection, their ongoing monitoring and the measurement capability for significant changes are necessary for targeted investigations, precautionary measures and the start of the forecasting window. Multispectral UAV images of high positional accuracy and quality are able to provide dependable relative displacement velocities and have the capability to serve as a reliable tool. On the contrary, satellite images showed delusive results, and we recommend reconsidering their deployment in future applications. The knowledge of the most suitable data in terms of accuracy and processing speed is crucial for landslide identification, monitoring and acceleration threshold detection. At present, our prelimiary findings show the capability to detect and monitor relative and mainly slow changes. The detection of rapid changes lacks due to the accuracy, resolution and revisit time of the investigated remote sensing systems.</p>\n"

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adequacy of the developed protocol by verifying the validity of the expert group for the earthquake and fire response simulation protocol. A protocol development team consisting of one emergency rescue professor, one counseling psychology professor, three paramedics, and one firefighter developed the study’s protocols to promote the core response and capabilities required at an earthquake fire site. We checked the content validity for the appropriateness of the contextual connection for each stage for the protocol. We also created an evaluation checklist to measure the items for each stage. The protocol developed in this study consists of earthquake response, fire response, evacuation, and fire suppression. We set the situation for each stage and composed learner activities and learning performance goals. The earthquake response stage included (1) shout “it’s an earthquake,” (2) protect yourself, (3) turn off electricity and gas, and (4) evacuate to a safe place. In the fire response stage, (1) shout “fire,” (2) press the emergency bell and call 119, (3) close the door of a dangerous place where fire can spread, and (4) evacuate to a safe place. In the evacuation stage, (1) open the emergency exit, (2) cover your nose and mouth, (3) lower your posture, and (4) evacuate quickly in one direction. Lastly, in the firefighting stage, (1) pull out the safety pin, (2) hold the nozzle and face the fire, (3) grab the handle, and (4) spray the powder evenly. The protocol contributes to the development of systematic and elaborate simulation education materials in the future. Furthermore, it provides basic data for future disaster simulation operation and protocol development through continuous training and practical exercises."

      "abstract": "Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning. We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive. Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning."

      "abstract": "The development of drug-resistant microorganisms is taking a heavy toll on the biomedical world. Clinical infections are costly and becoming increasingly dangerous as bacteria that once responded to standard antibiotic treatment are developing resistance mechanisms that require innovative treatment strategies. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule produced endogenously that has shown potent antibacterial capabilities in numerous research studies. Its multimechanistic antibacterial methods prevent the development of resistance and have shown potential as an alternative to antibiotics. However, there has yet to be a direct comparison study evaluating the antibacterial properties of NO against antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic-resistant clinically isolated bacterial strains. Herein, standardized lab and clinically isolated drug-resistant bacterial strains are compared side-by-side for growth and viability following treatment with NO released from S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an NO donor molecule. Evaluation of growth kinetics revealed complete killing of E. coli lab and clinical strains at 17.5 mM GSNO, though 15 mM displayed >50% killing and significantly reduced metabolic activity, with greater dose dependence for membrane permeability. Clinical P. aeruginosa showed greater susceptibility to GSNO during growth curve studies, but metabolic activity and membrane permeability demonstrated similar effects for 12.5 mM GSNO treatment of lab and clinical strains. MRSA lab and clinical strains exhibited total killing at 17.5 mM treatment, though metabolic activity was decreased, and membrane permeation began at 12.5 mM for both strains. Lastly, both S. epidermidis strains were killed by 15 mM GSNO, with sensitivities in metabolic activity and membrane permeability at 12.5 mM GSNO. The mirrored antibacterial effects seen by the lab and clinical strains of two Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria reveal the translational success of NO as an antibacterial therapy and potential alternative to standard antibiotic treatment."

      "abstract": "Self-driving vehicles rely on High Definition Street Maps (HD Maps) to ensure the safety and comfort of their driving capabilities. However, the road network infrastructure is subject to constant changes (e.g. through constructions works, accidents, ...). Such changes have to be quickly identified to avoid dangerous driving situations, for example through a reduction of driving speed or the safe handover of driving control back to the human. To address this issue we propose a road hazard detection algorithm that identifies and marks the extent of such changes based on crowdsourced GNSS data. To increase the detection speed of our proposed algorithm, we only rely on sensor information in the collection process, that is not only available through vehicles, but as well by cheap and ubiquitous devices carried on by the passengers such as smartphones. To deal with the limited accuracy of the collected data, we enhance existing algorithmic clustering approaches by leveraging additional meta-data such as the quality of the collected GNSS points and the vehicle’s current lane position. Our concept is evaluated with real world measurements in a highway construction site scenario showing improved performance in comparison to the Kernel Density Estimation reference algorithm, used versatile in Related Work."

However, due to the insufficient and unbalanced data used for training and testing, deep learning model will easily overfit and have poor generalization capabilities. The problem of collecting balanced and sufficient data often arises because it is difficult and dangerous to collect data under abnormal situations, such as abnormal weather or camera damage. In addition, neural networks need to be trained on a large amount of accurate and reliable data. Incorrect data may result in poor performance. In this study, we analyze the impact of abnormal situations on the traffic images and perform a series of image processing methods on the normal traffic dataset to generate sufficient and balanced images. Moreover, we use the trained deep learning model to evaluate the effectiveness of the augmented dataset."

(2) Method: The difference in efficacy was evaluated by comparing the risks detected in two groups in an initial assessment (with visits in the 2006–2008 period) to the risks detected in a later assessment, either after an intervention by Authorized Technicians with enforcement capabilities or after an intervention by Technical Advisors without enforcement capabilities (2011–2013). The assessments identified risks in the companies, according to a specific risk map for olive oil mill enterprises. (3) Results: Statistically significant differences were observed in the comparison of the risk reductions of the two groups, with regard to the initial assessment. The greatest reductions in risk were found in the companies that received interventions by Authorized Technicians with enforcement capabilities, in the sections of individual protection equipment and the storage of dangerous products. (4) Conclusion: Interventions by Authorized Technicians with enforcement capabilities are more effective than interventions by Technical Advisors without enforcement capabilities."

      "abstract": "Iryna Kochmar Vasyl Karabyn 1 Lviv State University of Life Safety 2Lviv State University of Life Safety Mining areas are centres of increased environmental danger. This is due to the development and operation of mines and subsequent beneficiation of coal, as well as the storage of significant volumes of empty waste rock in landfills. An important component of ensuring environmental safety is the investigation of the factors and ways of the impact of rock dumps on the state of the environment. In this regard, the article examines the forms of heavy metals found in the rock of the waste heap of the central coal enrichment plant \"Chervonohradska\" of the Lviv-Volyn coal basin. The environmental hazard factors caused by the distribution of various forms of lead, cadmium, zinc, and copper, based on establishing the migration capabilities of these elements in the technogenesis zone, are analyzed. It was determined that the gross content of lead reaches 16.32 mg/kg, cadmium – 5.84 mg/kg (exceeding clarke up to 29.2 times in siliceous siltstone and siltstone), zinc – 421 mg/kg (exceeding clarke up to 5.26 times in sandstone, siltstone and siliceous siltstone), copper – 112.89 mg/kg (exceeding clarke by 2 times in siltstone). The concentration coefficients of heavy metals in the samples were determined in relation to the gross form. The results of the research give a reason to evaluate the rocks of the waste dump in terms of the distribution of various forms of Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu as dangerous for the environment and unsuitable for use because in all the samples an excess content was observed in one form or another."

      "abstract": "Sir, This letter relates to the recent publication entitled ‘Cascading Bias of Initial Exposure to Information at the Crime Scene to the Subsequent Evaluation of Skeletal Remains’ (1) published in this journal. We wish to raise concerns for discussion regarding such an approach to research. While we wholeheartedly acknowledge the importance of bias and the necessity for ongoing research in this domain, there are fundamental methodological flaws that recur within the literature addressing bias across forensic science practice. In this paper, these have resulted in an inappropriate and potentially dangerous extrapolation to the professionalism of a certified forensic community. It is for this reason that we felt it imperative to raise our concerns for discussion within the forensic practitioner community, since this type of research not only impacts on the current discipline under consideration but also on other subjects. The paper concerned bases its conclusions on research undertaken using unqualified MSc students who are described as having an educational background of ‘bioarchaeology/biological and physical anthropology or osteology’ (1). The research subjects involved in this study are therefore utilized inappropriately as proxies for practicing forensic anthropologists. Indeed, the authors use the term “nonworking expert” to describe their participants which is misleading in the context of forensic practice. The use of the term “expert” in reference to students rather than experienced practitioners can and should be questioned. The profile of the subjects, as described by the authors, is of students who would not be expected to have had training in the requirements which are placed on forensic practitioners, including an awareness of the risks of cognitive bias. There is also no indication that the students have any practical experience of working on a forensic scenario within the U.K. criminal justice systems. According to the authors, the studied cohorts also contained no experienced forensic anthropologists or any students who had studied forensic anthropology therefore rendering invalid any claims regarding relevance to the profession. We would argue therefore, that suggesting that the results are reflective of practicing forensic anthropologists is a gross misrepresentation and an outcome that cannot be verified from the subjects examined. Subsequently, the conclusions cannot be borne out by the results. In short, the only viable conclusion from this research is that inexperienced MSc students, who have studied bioarcheology or physical anthropology, may be biased by contextual information. We are surprised and disturbed that these issues were not picked up in peer review and brought to the attention of the editor prior to publishing. We would welcome viable studies into bias within the forensic practitioner community, but utilizing unqualified students as a proxy is scientifically unacceptable and particularly so when then used to question the professional capabilities of a forensic discipline."

      "abstract": "Forest fires are extremely dangerous to ecosystems, animals, and humans; thus, it is crucial to detect them early on to limit the harm they cause. Presenting a novel framework for the detection of forest fires is the objective of this study. To increase detection speed and accuracy, this framework mixes colour, motion, and form information with machine learning algorithms. To capture the dynamic nature of fire—its ever-changing hues, distorted forms, and unending motion—an iterative method is employed. Colour probabilities are determined during the segmentation stage before going to the verification step. The categorisation stage and subsequent picture processing both make use of colour histograms. These characteristics allow the system to distinguish between flames and other things more effectively. Evaluating the framework's efficacy involved using intersection over union (IoU) ratios and frame-based evaluation. While IoU is used to test the system's ability to localise the fire inside an image, frame-based assessment is used to test the accuracy of fire detection. Tests on the VisiFire dataset proved the framework's dependability with an 89.97% true-positive rate and a 10.03% false-negative rate. And with an average frame rate of 21.70 FPS, the system is fast enough for real-time processing workloads. Considering these results, it seems like the suggested approach could greatly enhance forest fire early warning capabilities. It can also maintain a high degree of accuracy while providing quicker response times. Protecting forest ecosystems, reducing human life danger, and improving disaster management are all possible outcomes of integrating this technology into early warning systems. This framework is a huge step forward in the world of modern fire detection systems."

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are possessed of numerous beneficial capabilities, yet their potential inclination harbors unpredictable risks that may materialize in the future. We hence propose CRiskEval, a Chinese dataset meticulously designed for gauging the risk proclivities inherent in LLMs such as resource acquisition and malicious coordination, as part of efforts for proactive preparedness. To curate CRiskEval, we define a new risk taxonomy with 7 types of frontier risks and 4 safety levels, including extremely hazardous,moderately hazardous, neutral and safe. We follow the philosophy of tendency evaluation to empirically measure the stated desire of LLMs via fine-grained multiple-choice question answering. The dataset consists of 14,888 questions that simulate scenarios related to predefined 7 types of frontier risks. Each question is accompanied with 4 answer choices that state opinions or behavioral tendencies corresponding to the question. All answer choices are manually annotated with one of the defined risk levels so that we can easily build a fine-grained frontier risk profile for each assessed LLM. Extensive evaluation with CRiskEval on a spectrum of prevalent Chinese LLMs has unveiled a striking revelation: most models exhibit risk tendencies of more than 40% (weighted tendency to the four risk levels). Furthermore, a subtle increase in the model's inclination toward urgent self-sustainability, power seeking and other dangerous goals becomes evident as the size of models increase. To promote further research on the frontier risk evaluation of LLMs, we publicly release our dataset at https://github.com/lingshi6565/Risk_eval."

      "abstract": "Relevance of the article is due to the need to predict changes in the characteristics of traditional and new occupations with regard to development of information technologies and automation tools. The aim of the work is to identify the main areas of optimization and support of professional activities in the conditions of informatization based on the forecast of changes in conditions and situations of activity. Methods — theoretical analysis and systematization of ideas about the determinants of activity and their integration. Results. Stability and variability of professional activities are considered within the framework of situational approach, focused on the integration of external conditions and internal variables as the determinant of activities. The study clarifies the concept of activity conditions as characteristics of the environment. The definition of situation is limited to the relation of subjective interpretation and assessment of external conditions to evaluating personal resources in accordance with the purpose and actual experience, the mechanism of which is associated with reflexive regulation of activities. In accordance with the nature of subjective assessment of conditions, the types of situations are divided into ordinary and extreme. The situation is usual (standard) for a subject if the methods of action are well-established and assessed adequately, regardless of the conditions, which can be even dangerous, extreme and emergency. Unusual situations are characterized by a combination of novelty of conditions, on the one hand, and limited experience and resource assessment, on the other hand. According to the characteristics of resources (functional systems and the content of experience) it is suggested to distinguish between situations of tension, characterized by the need to act at the limit of one’s opportunities but within one’s experience, and situations of uncertainty. There are a number of arguments for limiting the notion of “uncertainty” and the corresponding situations to the characteristics of the internal subjective sphere, the source of which are components of activity, not elements of the environment. In situations of uncertainty, it is suggested to distinguish between the situations of problem solving and decisions making, actions that differ in psychological mechanisms, and to consider risk situations as a subcategory of decision making. The systemization of situations formed the basis for the forecast of their changes for traditional and new occupations in the context of advanced information technology, as well as the definition of the directions of software support for action and ensuring the preparedness. Conclusions. The probability of extreme and emergency situations involving danger for people is unlikely to change. Dangerous situations in professional environments can start to be assessed as ordinary if one forms an adequate concept of conditions and one’s own resources (readiness) by using training systems, including virtual reality tools. Information security problems are being studied intensively, both in terms of theoretical analysis of information environment characteristics and in the development of software protection and minimization of danger. It seems possible to reduce the situations of extreme. Minimizing problem situations can be obtained by creating experience and reducing uncertainty. In decision-making and risk situations it can be obtained through software and technical support for the choice and automation of assessment operations. The possibilities of using software and technology to reduce tension will also be expanded through automation of cognitive and executive operations, alignment of their parameters with the subject’s mental capabilities, formation of skills allowing one to work in a wide range of situations."

      "abstract": "In 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, analysts were concerned that banks in Nepal were dangerously overexposed to inflated real estate and equity markets. Nepal's Central Bank (NRB) decided to evaluate its commercial banks, but needed outside expertise and assistance for stress-testing its banks and assessing the damages that could result from economic shocks. Standard International Monetary Fund (IMF) models for evaluating banks in developed economies, however, proved too complex and were unsuitable for the circumstances of a small developing country. Meanwhile, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had been carrying out quarterly stress-testing of banks in Pakistan. Upon hearing about SBP's capabilities from the World Bank, NRB leadership was eager to learn how to apply Pakistan's regulatory analysis in Nepal. The World Bank facilitated and funded a knowledge exchange between the two central banks so that NRB staff could learn to use a simplified stress-testing, scenario-based model to evaluate the financial stability of Nepal's banks, develop regulations to maintain the stability of banking institutions, and establish contingency plans in the case of failure of a Nepalese bank. This story demonstrates the power of doing development differently. Nepal is very motivated to solve a pressing problem. It actively shops for a solution: the standard model is not suitable, but the Pakistani model is. Pakistan is eager to share its model with Nepal. Nepal adopts and adapts it, and it works."

      "abstract": "The tenets of neurosurgery worldwide, whether in the civilian or military sector, espouse vigilance, the ability to adapt, extreme ownership, and, of course, an innate drive for developing a unique set of technical skills. At a time in history when the complexity of battlefield neurotrauma climaxed coupled with a chronic shortage of military neurosurgeons, modernized solutions were mandated in order to deliver world-class neurological care to our servicemen and servicewomen. Complex blast injuries, as caused by an increased incidence of improvised explosive devices, yielded widespread systemic inflammatory responses with multiorgan damage. In response to these challenges, the \"NeuroTeam,\" originally a unit of two neurosurgeons as deployed during Operation Desert Storm, was redesigned to instead pair a neurosurgeon with a neurointensivist and launched itself during two specialized missions in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Representing a hybridized version of present-day neurocritical care teams, the purpose of this unit was to optimize neurosurgical care by focusing on interdisciplinary collaboration in an Echelon III combat support hospital. The NeuroTeam provided unique workflow capabilities never seen collectively on the battlefield: downrange neurosurgical capability by a board-certified neurological surgeon within 60 minutes from the point of injury paired with a neurocritical care-trained intensivist. This also set the stage for intraoperative telemedicine infrastructure for neurosurgery and optimized the ability to evaluate, triage, and stabilize patients prior to medical evacuation. This novel military partnership ultimately allowed the neurosurgeon to focus on the tenets of the craft and thereby the dynamic needs of the patient first and foremost. Since the success of these missions, the NeuroTeam has evolved into a detachable unit, the \"Head and Neck Team,\" comprising neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, and ophthalmologists, supported by a postinjury hospital unit, which includes an embedded neurocritical care physician. The creation and evolution of the NeuroTeam, necessitated by a shortage of military neurosurgeons and the dangerous shift in military wartime tactics, best exemplifies multidisciplinary collaboration and military medicine agility. As neurocritical care continues to evolve into a highly complex, distinct specialty, the lessons learned by the NeuroTeam ultimately serve as a reminder for civilian and military physicians alike. Despite the conditions and despite one's professional ego, patients with highly complex morbid neurological disease deserve expert, multidisciplinary management for survival."

      "abstract": "The article analyzes the report documentation of the tests in which the Doppler radar trajectory measurement system MFTR–2100/40 and the muzzle velocity measurement system SL-520PE were used to determine the trajectory parameters of artillery armament. \nThe purpose of the article is to provide proposals for standard methods of using Doppler radar systems of trajectory measurements when testing artillery armament and its ammunition. \nThe proposals for these standard methods are based on the experience of using the MFTR–2100/40 radar system and the SL–520PE muzzle velocity measurement system during the tests of the latest specimens of artillery and ammunition and relate to typical Doppler radar systems. When choosing the position and mode of operation of such Doppler radar trajectory measurement systems, it is always necessary to take into account safety measures, instructions for their operation, technical features (capabilities) of radar systems specified in this article, considering the interference environment during firing (shot) of artillery armament and experiment (test) conditions. Placing typical Doppler radar systems when taking measurements in unplanned places is dangerous for the crew and measuring instruments and leads to partial or complete loss of measuring trajectory information and reduced measurement accuracy. \nAbovementioned proposals are offered to be taken into account when developing methods of trajectory measurements using typical Doppler radar systems during testing artillery armament and its ammunition. \nMethods of measurements using standard Doppler radar systems of trajectory measurements should be developed in accordance with current standards (GOST 8.010-99, GOST V 15.211-78 and others) for a particular test, taking into account the results of analysis of the characteristics of samples to be evaluated, measuring instruments used, conditions and locations of measurements."

      "abstract": "Mobility is one of the most challenging fundamentals of rural livelihood in the Himalayan hills and mountains. More than 8500 trail bridges, comprising an overall span-length of about 650 kilometers have been constructed to date, saving millions of walking hours for people living in the rural Himalayan areas. Previously, crossing rivers was dangerous and sometimes impossible, especially in the rainy season. These bridges created vital connections which enabled children to go to school and people to access public services and visit medical centers and sanctuaries. They also boost local economic output by reducing the effort required to run local farms, gather crops and visit regional markets.Fig. 1:The struggles and dangers of crossing a river and its solutionSwiss technical assistance for rural trail bridges started in the early sixties with the construction of a few suspension bridges in the hill areas of Nepal. In 1964 the Nepalese Government established the Suspension Bridge Division (SBD), and starting in 1972 the Swiss Government began providing continuous technical and financial assistance. Similarly, the Public Works Department in Bhutan initiated a country wide trail bridge construction program in 1971 for which assistance was provided from 1985-2010. Exchanges of experiences between these programs created a collaborative environment where new ideas could be evaluated and tested in the field. After SBD initially developed the basic technical norms, design parameters and standard designs suitable for long-span bridges, demand for simpler shorter span bridges rose tremendously. This prompted the program to develop “community executable bridge designs” adapted to the local skills and materials while conforming to established engineering standards. As a result, cost-effective, easy to implement technologies and community-based approaches were developed, which have been replicated in numerous countries leading to multiple successful partnerships in international development cooperation.The purpose of this paper is to highlight the following outcomes of the trail bridge-program:Standardized cost-effective trail bridge designs based on local capabilities and bridge-building techniquesPublished of manuals, technical drawings and teaching resources for design, construction and fabricationEngaged local communities in the construction, operation and maintenance of trail bridgesCompiled comprehensive trail bridge directory for planning, monitoring and maintenanceEstablished Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) with institutional frameworks at national and local level‘South-South Cooperation’ with Bhutan, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Laos, Burundi, Honduras, Guatemala"

      "abstract": "We have reported a highly efficient, low-voltage, and cost-effective H2S gas sensor utilizing the nanocomposite thin film of conjugated organic polymer Poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta [2,1-b; 3,4-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{b}'$ </tex-math></inline-formula>] dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and inorganic material (MoS2) as an active sensing layer. To enhance the molecular ordering of the polymer chains in a composite solution, a photoirradiation method has been employed. A facile, inexpensive, and solution-processed floating film transfer method (FTM) is used to fabricate the nanocomposite thin film of PCPDTBT/MoS2. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art annealing method known as “solvent vapor annealing” (SVA) provides improved crystallinity and excellent charge transfer throughout the polymer chain, which substantially enhances the gas sensing performance. High-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${k}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> dielectric film of HfLaOx was deposited using the precursors of Hf and La, and spin coating deposition method. The dielectric film exhibited a smooth, pin-hole free, and uniform nature with a very low rms roughness of 0.18 nm and excellent dielectric properties such as high bandgap (5.2 eV), low leakage current density (100 nA/cm2 at −5 V), and high-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${k}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> (24.8). To evaluate the thin film’s electrical and gas detecting capabilities for harmful and dangerous H2S gas, a top contact bottom gate (TCBG) organic field effect transistor (OFET) was fabricated. The device was exceptionally responsive to the presence of hydrogen sulfide gas at concentrations even lower than 1 ppm and operated at room temperature (RT). The developed OFET device exhibits outstanding air stability, excellent response-recovery behavior, outstanding gas response repeatability, and a sensor response of 93.2% at 1 ppm exposure of H2S gas. Response/recovery times are 4/55 s, respectively."

      "abstract": "In today's society, the world of computer networks is rapidly expanding and has emerged as an essential means of information sharing. However, given the widespread use of networks for information sharing, data security has become even more critical. In spite of the fact that a variety of methods have been developed to safeguard data, intruders continue to develop novel strategies for breaching network security as new technologies emerge. R2L and U2R are two types of attacks that are considered to be uncommon due to their rarity in networks. However, because they allow intruders to gain access, these attacks can be very dangerous for the hosts they target. The current security system is limited in its ability to accurately, precisely, and without false alarms detect and prevent such attacks. A ton of examination is being finished to upgrade network security. This article discusses various measurable outcomes and itemized correlation with various strategies. Furthermore, with and without the use of feature selection techniques, we compare and contrast the attack detection capabilities of a number of existing approaches in this paper. New researchers may take benefit from these evaluative efforts to determine the most effective strategy for detecting rare class attacks and the significance of incorporating feature selection schemes. NSL-KDD datasets are used to test and investigate an assessment."

      "abstract": "Accurate analysis of X-ray images is crucial for detecting potential hazardous items in luggage and packages in security screening. With the advancement of deep learning, automated object detection algorithms like YOLOv10 have demonstrated remarkable performance. This study aims to further enhance YOLOv10's detection capabilities, particularly in recognizing objects with complex backgrounds and small targets in X-ray images. By incorporating SPDConv and Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN), we significantly improved the model's performance in detecting prohibited items in X-ray images. Additionally, we compared the optimized YOLOv10 model with other mainstream object detection methods, including SSD and YOLOv5, and conducted ablation experiments to evaluate the impact of different components on model performance. Experimental results show that the optimized YOLOv10 achieved significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of the adopted techniques."

      "abstract": "Given the importance of sustaining collaborative stakeholder relationships from the conflicts in a changing environment of megaprojects, this research develops a model to systematically analyze stakeholder resilience in relationship management from measurement, analysis, and management perspectives. Through the NK model, dynamic stakeholder interactions can be accurately illustrated, and the network model provides a useful way to evaluate complex stakeholder structures. Then, stakeholder resilience is analyzed in two dimensions, namely, stakeholder issue vulnerabilities and stakeholder capabilities, and the evolutions of these dimensions are considered. Afterward, a stakeholder resilience map (including four resilient zones: dangerous, challenging, vigilant, and safe) is developed and validated using the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao Bridge (HZMB) project. The critical stakeholder issue vulnerabilities and stakeholder capability limitations in relationship management at each project phase of megaprojects are also identified. This study provides an evidence-based practical approach to evaluate stakeholder resilience in relationship management in megaprojects. It extends resilience theory in project management at organizational levels while effectively bridging stakeholder and relationship management concepts."

      "abstract": "Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36\\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models. These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help build more diverse sandbagging model organisms."

      "abstract": "This study includes the synthesis of new hydrogel using pectin, chitosan, and Mo-MOF (pectin/chitosan Mo-MOF hydrogel). After confirming the structure of the synthetic hydrogel by Elemental Analysis (EA), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), EDS mapping, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), its application in wastewater treatment, including the absorption of Congo red and the inhibition of pathogenic bacterial strains in wastewater, was evaluated. The factors affecting the adsorption of Congo red, such as pH, temperature, and contact time, were studied. The highest adsorption rate was determined to be 93% using 0.06 g/L of pectin/chitosan Mo-MOF hydrogel under conditions including pH 8, temperature of 25°C, and contact time of 90 min. The microbiology evaluations of the pectin/chitosan Mo-MOF hydrogel, which were performed against the known strains of wastewater such as Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Salmonella enterica, indicated its high antibacterial properties, so, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values were observed between 4 and 32 μg/mL and 8–64 μg/mL. The diverse characteristics of the pectin/chitosan Mo-MOF hydrogel can be attributed to its physical and chemical properties, such as its constituent compounds, specific surface area, and porosity. Finally, the pectin/chitosan Mo-MOF hydrogel can be introduced as a functional composition with unique capabilities in controlling pathogenic bacterial strains of wastewater and absorbing dangerous chemical compounds of wastewater for environmental purposes."

      "abstract": "Evaluations of dangerous AI capabilities are important for managing catastrophic risks. Public transparency into these evaluations - including what they test, how they are conducted, and how their results inform decisions - is crucial for building trust in AI development. We propose STREAM (A Standard for Transparently Reporting Evaluations in AI Model Reports), a standard to improve how model reports disclose evaluation results, initially focusing on chemical and biological (ChemBio) benchmarks. Developed in consultation with 23 experts across government, civil society, academia, and frontier AI companies, this standard is designed to (1) be a practical resource to help AI developers present evaluation results more clearly, and (2) help third parties identify whether model reports provide sufficient detail to assess the rigor of the ChemBio evaluations. We concretely demonstrate our proposed best practices with\"gold standard\"examples, and also provide a three-page reporting template to enable AI developers to implement our recommendations more easily."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Firefighting is among the most dangerous professions and requires exceptional physical fitness and focus while working. Patient-reported outcomes are a commonly used method to evaluate subjective health information and may be utilized by fire departments to identify the health status of firefighters and provide insight to promote their health and wellness. OBJECTIVE: This study is a novel analysis of firefighters’ self-reported health to potentially identify musculoskeletal dysfunction, assist in therapeutic intervention, and improve overall health and wellness. METHODS: Firefighters were evaluated using seven different self-reported health surveys to assess various physical capabilities and quality of life. The questionnaires were delivered via online format and administered once to provide a snapshot of a suburban Oklahoma fire department. RESULTS: Using the Disablement in the Physically Active Scale, 14 of the 35 firefighters answered “slight, moderate, or severe” for the pain and motion variables. Only two of the firefighters indicated no stiffness or soreness after activity on the Nirschl Phase Rating Scale. The firefighters mean rating for “energy/fatigue” via the RAND-36 was 54.14 out of 100. CONCLUSION: Firefighters frequently report pain, impaired motion, and soreness, indicating areas in which health and wellness interventions may be helpful. The incorporation of periodic health surveys into firefighter health and wellness programming can highlight the presence of concerns, as well as intervention effectiveness by subjective health status reporting. By combining the health surveys with aerobic and core strength exercises, fire departments may be able to monitor and improve firefighter health."

      "abstract": "Heavy metal ions are amongst the most toxic elements that can be found in water. Dangerous contamination of water with heavy metal ions must be identified as quickly and reliably as possible and the relevant information must reach immediately and reliably those who need it (government bodies, local authorities, scientists, citizens) for prevention, taking the appropriate measures and further analysis. In this paper we present the approach of the MICSYS research project for an advanced edge to cloud system architecture for smart real-time water quality monitoring using cutting-edge portable IoT biosensor devices. The paper analyzes the implementation of this architecture, its evaluation criteria and methodology as well as its initial evaluation. The architecture ensures speed, reliability and general availability of measurements, moves processing as close as possible to the data sources, while taking advantage of the computing power on the path from the edge device to the cloud. The significant computing capabilities of the cloud can be used for further analysis of the raw data from the measuring devices using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to refine the estimation algorithms of concentrations, find contamination trends in different areas and estimate future contamination risks."

      "abstract": "The problems of optimization of a controlled object pursuing several goals are considered. A model of multi-criteria optimization has been obtained, which allows the controlled object to realize all the goals set in the entire range of possible situations without the direct participation of a person. A systematic approach to the problem of vector optimization made it possible to combine models of individual trade-off schemes into a single integral structure that adapts to the situation of making a multi-criteria decision. The advantage of the concept of a non-linear trade-off scheme is the possibility of making a multi-criteria decision formally, which is a hallmark of artificial intelligence. The apparatus of the nonlinear trade-off scheme, developed as a formalized tool for studying management systems with conflicting criteria, allows the artificial intelligence system to solve practically multi-criteria problems of a wide class. Artificial intelligence systems are created in order to replace a person as a decision maker in this or that situation. AI systems such as robots, decision support systems, neural networks, etc. operate in conditions that a person considers unfavorable for himself. Thus, a demining robot operates in an environment that is dangerous for a sapper. Decision support systems are usually used in conditions of time pressure or in aggressive environments. Neural network classifiers process volumes of information that exceed the capabilities of a human operator, etc. Replacing a person with an AI system requires the formalization of both the formulation and the process of solving the problem. Subjective factors should be excluded from the solution algorithm. A special place among such systems is occupied by those which functioning is evaluated by a set of conflicting quality criteria. When solving a specific problem of vector optimization, the decision maker creates his own model of the objective function (utility function) in accordance with his preferences."

      "abstract": "Terahertz imaging is the newest among non-invasive sensing technologies, and its use is currently considered in various applications. Among the potential applications, food inspection is one of the most important cases due to the possible dangerous impact on human safety. Terahertz (THz) systems are, indeed, attracting increasing attention in food inspection due to their ability to detect surface defects and foreign body contamination in a non-invasive way. In order to evaluate the capabilities of THz technology, laboratory experiments were carried out by using a fibre-coupled THz time-domain system. The surveys were performed by preparing ad-hoc samples realized by filling a plastic support with a commercial chocolate cream covered by a cap mimicking a commercial packaging. The presented results provide further evidence of the THz waves ability to detect foreign body in food."

      "abstract": "With the rise in green chemistry and growing concern over worker and consumer protection, businesses and regulatory agencies are increasingly looking to identify alternative chemicals for use in products and manufacturing processes. Alternatives assessment involves comparing the advantages and disadvantages of potential substitutes for toxic chemicals,1 and numerous agencies, nonprofits, and businesses have developed frameworks to help them conduct these analyses. In this issue of EHP, investigators review nearly two dozen of alternatives assessment frameworks to identify what’s working and what needs improvement in this rapidly advancing field.2 \n \nAs governments around the world begin to require alternatives assessments for chemicals of high concern,3 the need for more robust decision-making capabilities is becoming apparent, says first author Molly Jacobs, a project manager at the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production. To determine the factors common to a high-quality alternatives assessment framework, as well as identify areas that require more work, Jacobs and colleagues identified 20 frameworks that have been published since 1990 and evaluated six core areas: hazard assessment, exposure characterization, life cycle impacts, technical feasibility assessment, economic feasibility assessment, and decision-making processes for reaching conclusions about alternatives. \n \n \n \nIdentifying less-toxic alternatives to chemicals of concern ideally will lead to safer consumer products. \n \n \n \nThe group’s analysis showed that all the assessment frameworks incorporated hazards, costs, and performance. However, they lacked consistency in ranking and scoring the hazards created by different chemicals, as well as in the end points they addressed and the methods and criteria used to reach conclusions.2 \n \nSome of the difficulty in comparing these frameworks is that they are designed to accommodate the specific needs of the parties using them. For instance, a small business will use quite a different framework than a large corporation or governmental agency, because the latter have the resources to do a much more in-depth assessment. “There is need for flexibility in the approach to using these alternatives assessment frameworks given differences in context—regulatory versus nonregulatory, government versus business, differences in business positions along the supply chain, etc.,” Jacobs explains. \n \nSelecting an alternative isn’t always straightforward. Businesses need to factor in the cost of replacements as well as how a new chemical will fit into existing manufacturing processes, says Paul DeLeo, associate vice president for environmental safety at the American Cleaning Institute, which represents manufacturers of consumer cleaning products. “We’re doing alternatives assessment every day—it’s part of product design,” DeLeo says. But it’s a complicated process with a lot of moving parts. “We need to distill the process down into more manageable segments,” he says. \n \nSuitable alternatives don’t have to be risk-free, just lower-risk, and the risk needs to be manageable with appropriate protections. “There are always trade-offs to make, such as determining whether it’s better to use a little of a chemical that’s more dangerous or a lot of one that’s more moderate,” says Igor Linkov, a risk and decision scientist for the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center. Linkov was not involved with the review. \n \nAt the same time, says coauthor Joel Tickner, an environmental health scientist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, “we need to make sure that we don’t jump out of the frying pan and into the fire.” As one example of this, the authors point to 1-bromopropane (1-BP, also called n-propyl bromide). In the late 1990s 1-BP was marketed as an alternative for banned solvents such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Some companies also began to substitute 1-BP for other commonly used solvents. But in the years that followed, a number of published case reports described neurotoxic effects in workers exposed to 1-BP,4,5,6 and 1-BP is now designated as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.7 1-BP became the epitome of what the Occupational Safety and Health Administration calls “regrettable substitutions.”8 \n \nGiven the emphasis on green chemistry, the field of alternatives assessment likely will only continue to pick up momentum, Linkov says. But the results of the new analysis indicate that ongoing interdisciplinary research will be required to take alternatives assessments to their highest potential."

      "abstract": "Titanium and titanium alloys are attractive materials in a variety of industries such as aerospace due to a high strength to weight ratio and a surface which is naturally resistance to many forms of corrosion. However, tribological properties such as poor abrasion resistance and high friction during metal-to-metal contact have proven difficult to handle without additional treatments. Application of coatings onto the material’s surface is one means of protecting it from those poor tribological properties.\n Electroplated nickel coatings retain much of the corrosion resistance desired of titanium alloys while also exhibiting better abrasion and wear resistance. Electroplating onto titanium and its alloys is prohibitively difficult due to the propensity of the material to form a tenacious oxide coating on any fresh surface instantaneously after its exposure. The oxide surface acts as a barrier between the solution and the titanium surface reducing the adhesion strength of the resulting deposit. The oxide layer is most commonly removed and the surface modified by hydrofluoric acid (HF) based treatments. HF is considered highly dangerous to workers and to the environment and work is being done to heavily limit its use.\n For this work, a proprietary chloride-based solution was used during the preparatory steps. Brush or selective plating was chosen as the application technique due to its ability to perform the entire operation with the substrate exposed to solution and under potential control. In most applications of electroplating, the surface/part to be plated must be transferred between multiple tanks containing each preparatory solution used to etch and activate the surface which would involve exposure to air at several points. In addition, the brushing action inherent in brush or selective plating creates a surface environment which can be optimized to promote strong adhesion at the nickel/titanium interface.\n This presentation will discuss how SIFCO’s brush plating process technology and automation capabilities were used to achieve strong adhesion to the titanium surface without the use of HF. Focus was specifically placed on achieving strong adhesion of a nickel pre-plate onto the titanium surface which allows for a multitude of other coatings to be applied thereafter. The method was performed using a single anode through which the solutions for each step flowed. The samples were under applied potential and immersed in solution throughout the entire process. Applied potential and solution delivery were automated to maximize process consistency.\n Samples were measured for tensile adhesion strength via the specification ASTM C633. Several variables related to the preparatory procedure were optimized during the study including the flow rate of the solution, the voltage/current conditions, and the evaluation of preparatory steps taken before the electrochemical procedure."

To support decision-making on the safe use and development of AI systems, there is a growing need for high-quality evaluations of dangerous model capabilities. While several attempts to provide such evaluations have been made, a clear definition of what constitutes a\"good evaluation\"has yet to be agreed upon. In this practitioners' perspective paper, we present a set of best practices for safety evaluations, drawing on prior work in model evaluation and illustrated through cybersecurity examples. We first discuss the steps of the initial thought process, which connects threat modeling to evaluation design. Then, we provide the characteristics and parameters that make an evaluation useful. Finally, we address additional considerations as we move from building specific evaluations to building a full and comprehensive evaluation suite."

      "abstract": "Morocco is one of the richest countries in biodiversity in the Mediterranean region, especially in its ophidian fauna. In total, there are eight species of venomous snakes, with seven belonging to the Viperidae family, responsible for 67.2% of severe envenomation cases in the country. Cerastes cerastes, Daboia mauritanica and Bitis arietans are considered among the most venomous vipers whose bites cause high levels of morbidity, disability or mortality. Despite their wide distribution in the kingdom, the incidence of these snakebites remains poorly understood and largely underestimated. Moreover, intraspecific variations in the venom composition significantly affect the effectiveness of antivenoms. Due to the unavailability of locally produced antivenoms, we evaluated the efficacy of Inoserp-MENA, the only available antivenom in Morocco, against C. cerastes, D. mauritanica and B. arietans. First, we conducted a comprehensive characterization of these venoms, including an LD50 test to examine their toxicity and SDS-PAGE as a technique to analyze the enzymes responsible for biological activities, such as hemorrhagic and edematous activities and myotoxicity, which generate physiopathological effects in the skin, paws and muscles of envenomed mice. Then, we assessed the ability of Inoserp-MENA antivenom to neutralize the toxic activities of Moroccan vipers. Our results indicate that the venom of C. cerastes, D. mauritanica and B. arietans are toxic, causing severe alterations such as edema, myotoxicity, myonecrosis and significant hemorrhages with the formation of hemorrhagic foci. C. cerastes venom is more dangerous in terms of lethality and hemorrhages, while B. arietans venom is more edematous. The effects of C. cerastes venom were effectively neutralized, but Inoserp-MENA antivenom failed to protect mice against the toxic effects induced by B. arietans and D. mauritanica venom. The study reveals alarming shortcomings in the effectiveness of the current commercially available antivenom’s dosage and neutralization capabilities, highlighting the urgent need to develop a region-specific viper envenomation therapy."

      "abstract": "This novel approach in animal biology could revolutionize identifying endangered species, addressing the issue of misclassifying potentially harmful animals based solely on visual characteristics. Particularly impactful for farmers in agricultural fields, it aims to reduce the heightened risk of venomous animal attacks, ultimately improving safety. Due to a lack of accessible education, illiterate farmers are more susceptible to adopting superstitious beliefs, which tragically leads to fatal snakebites even when medical treatment is readily available. Furthermore, environmental factors can unexpectedly hold typically non‐threatening animals responsible for a large number of human deaths each year. However, the complexity of human recognition of these hazards has prompted the development of a novel design approach aimed at simplifying the process. Integration of the ResNet learning algorithm in conjunction with You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) within the framework is recommended to facilitate real‐time processing and improve accuracy. This combined approach not only speeds up animal recognition but also takes advantage of ResNet's deep learning capabilities. The first phase entails deploying YOLOv5 to detect the presence of snakes in the proposed study, achieving a remarkable 87% precision in snake detection thanks to the synergistic fusion of ResNet and YOLOv5."

      "abstract": "In the realm of audio signal processing, detecting impulsive urban sounds within continuous audio streams remains a complex endeavor. This paper presents an innovative solution via a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) framework. The CNN segments of the model target the extraction of spatial hierarchies from the audio, while the RNN components leverage their temporal memory capabilities to recognize and sequence sporadic urban auditory events. Drawing data from a rich collection of urban audio signals sourced from multiple global metropolises, the hybrid model was rigorously trained and evaluated. Findings underscore its superior detection accuracy in comparison to conventional methods, with a marked decrease in false positives. Moreover, the adaptability of the CNN-RNN architecture was evidenced by its consistent performance across diverse acoustic environments. This advancement in impulsive urban sound detection not only accentuates the efficacy of combined CNN-RNN systems but also has broader implications for urban planning, environmental assessments, and public safety initiatives."

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the usability of wireless transmission technologies, for giving connectivity to wireless monitoring systems aimed at safeguarding workers operating within areas restricted for safety reasons, like human-dangerous spaces, or underground tanks. In such areas, critical conditions may arise, so that sensing is required in order to prevent incidents. For instance, possible emission of poisonous gases could be detected to ensure healthy conditions. To this aim, workers can be provided with portable Internet of Things (IoT) sensing devices in charge of measuring a set of physical and environmental parameters. The corresponding collected data is transmitted in real-time to a centre responsible for logging the collected information and engaging proper emergency procedures. Since, restricted areas may be built with materials intrinsically able to shield the electromagnetic field to some extent, the feasibility of wireless links traversing such structures, should be assessed. To this end, in the presented study two measurement campaigns were sorted out, in a context replicating real-life cases. During tests, the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol was considered, since it has rather robust transmission capabilities where a low bitrate is needed. There, three combinations of transmission parameters were evaluated, specifically aiming at reproducing standard, emergency, and enhanced receiver sensitivity conditions. Test results proved the feasibility of performing at least a reliable single-hop wireless link traversing the underground tank. Moreover, the testes conditions can give valuable insight to practitioners in the field during the design phase of similar monitoring systems."

The accurate evaluation of the performance of different Public Safety Communication (PSC) networking and communications technologies is therefore of paramount importance, and the characterization of the scenario in which these technologies need to operate is fundamental to obtain meaningful results. In this paper, we present the implementation of three reference PSC scenarios, which are open source and made publicly available to the research community, describing the incidents, the mobility and applications of first responders, and providing examples on how a mmWave-based Radio Access Network (RAN) can support high-traffic use cases. Moreover, we present the implementation of two novel mobility models for ns-3, which can be used to enable the simulation of realistic PSC scenarios in ns-3."

      "abstract": "—Structured Query Language injection (SQLi) remains one of the most pervasive and dangerous threats to web-based systems, capable of compromising databases and bypassing authentication protocols. Despite advancements in machine learning for cybersecurity, many models rely on static detection rules or require extensive labeled datasets, making them less adaptable to evolving threats. Addressing this limitation, the present study aimed to design, implement, and evaluate a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model capable of detecting SQLi attacks using reinforcement learning. The research employed a Design and Development Research (DDR) methodology, supported by an evolutionary prototyping framework, and utilized a dataset of 30,919 labeled SQL queries, balanced between malicious and safe inputs. Preprocessing involved query normalization and vector encoding into fixed-length ASCII representations. The DQN model was trained over 2,000 episodes, using experience replay and an epsilon-greedy strategy. Key evaluation metrics— accuracy, cumulative reward, and epsilon decay—showed performance improvements, with accuracy increasing from 52% to 82% and stabilizing between 65% and 73% in later episodes. The agent demonstrated consistent adaptability by successfully generalizing across various injection patterns. This outcome suggests that reinforcement learning, particularly using DQN, provides a viable alternative to traditional models, with superior resilience and dynamic learning capabilities. The model's convergence trend highlights its practical application in real-time SQLi detection systems, contributing significantly to cybersecurity measures for database-driven applications."

      "abstract": "The scarcity of data depicting dangerous situations presents a major obstacle to training AI systems for safety-critical applications, such as construction safety, where ethical and logistical barriers hinder real-world data collection. This creates an urgent need for an end-to-end framework to generate synthetic data that can bridge this gap. While existing methods can produce synthetic scenes, they often lack the semantic depth required for scene simulations, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel multi-agent framework that employs an iterative, in-the-loop collaboration between two agents: an Evaluator Agent, acting as an LLM-based judge to enforce semantic consistency and safety-specific constraints, and an Editor Agent, which generates and refines scenes based on this guidance. Powered by LLM's capabilities to reasoning and common-sense knowledge, this collaborative design produces synthetic images tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Our experiments suggest this design can generate useful scenes based on realistic specifications that address the shortcomings of prior approaches, balancing safety requirements with visual semantics. This iterative process holds promise for delivering robust, aesthetically sound simulations, offering a potential solution to the data scarcity challenge in multimedia safety applications."

      "abstract": ": One of the most dangerous oceanic pollutions nowadays is marine oil spills, which occur when crude oil is released into the oceanic water and must be contained quickly since they can extend to large areas and result in serious ecological, economic, and health consequences. Places like the Gulf of Oman are highly vulnerable to oil spill accidents due to the high marine activity there. Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) have proven their capabilities in countless fields, and detecting oil spills is one of them. This study explores the potential of combining remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for oil spill detection on the Eastern Coast of the United Arab Emirates. Leveraging Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical data, we develop and evaluate a methodology to identify oil spills. While specific accuracy assessments await further testing, initial visual analysis indicates promising results. The study contributes to advancements in oil spill detection by demonstrating the potential of using these remote sensing techniques in this region. Additionally, it highlights the value of GIS integration for data analysis and visualization. This research holds promise for improved oil spill monitoring and environmental protection efforts on the Eastern Coast of the United Arab Emirates."

Hygienic, epidemiological, sanitary-statistical, in-depth medical examination method and mathematical-statistical methods were applied. Working conditions of teachers are characterized by complex effects of harmful production factors, which can reach 3 degree of 3 class of harmful work by intensity (according to the calculated points 3,63), 2nd degree of 3 class of harmful pressure on vocal apparatus (27,52±3,54 hours), 1 degree of 3 class of harmful by equivalent noise level and unfavorable microclimate. The most widespread pathologies of the vocal apparatus are chronic hypertrophic laryngitis (190,20±22,61) and chronic catarrhal laryngitis (131,00±15,07 cases). Almost 70% of occupational laryngitis cases are in the age group of 46-60 years. The critical length of service influenced by voice load is 10-19 years. The length of service more than 20 years in conditions of voice load increases the etiological percent of occupational pathology causes to 81,8%. Therefore, an age of 45,8±0,5 and older is dangerous for the occupational laryngitis progression and requires a special approach of development and implementation of preventive measures aimed at maintaining of occupational health.

Профілактика професійного ларингіту у вчителів. Савушина І.В., Павленко О.І., Зоська Я.В. Коло осіб, які потребують фоніатричної допомоги, у наш час постійно збільшується. Люди з патологією голосу перебувають у працездатному віці. Метою досліджень було: зниження ризику розвитку професійної патології голосового апарату на підставі обґрунтування комплексної системи керування професійним ризиком у вчителів. Під час досліджень був застосований гігієнічний, епідеміологічний, санітарно-статистичний метод поглибленого медичного обстеження та математико-статистичний метод. Умови праці вчителів характеризуються комплексним впливом шкідливих виробничих факторів, які можуть досягати 3 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за напруженістю праці (згідно з розрахованими балами 3,63), 2 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за навантаженням на голосовий апарат (27,52±3,54 години), 1 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за еквівалентним рівнем шуму та несприятливим мікрокліматом. Найбільш розповсюдженою патологією голосового апарату у вчителів є хронічний гіпертрофічний ларингіт (190,20±22,61) та хронічний катаральний ларингіт (131,00±15,07 випадка). Майже 70% випадків професійного ларингіту припадає на вікову групу 46-60 років. ПРОФІЛАКТИЧНА МЕДИЦИНА 162 На умовах ліцензії CC BY 4.0 Критичним стажем роботи в умовах впливу голосового навантаження є 10-19 років. Стаж роботи понад 20 років в умовах голосового навантаження збільшує етіологічну частку в причинах виникнення професійної патології до 81,8%. Тому вік працівника понад 45,8±0,5 є критичним у ризику розвитку професійного захворювання, що потребує особливого підходу при розробці та впровадженні профілактичних заходів, спрямованих на збереження професійного здоров’я. Запропонований комплекс заходів збільшить здорову частку життя на 7,3 року і зменшить втрати років здорового життя на 7,1 року, в тому числі для фізичного компоненту здоров’я (PH) на 4,5 і 4,3 і психологічного компоненту здоров’я (MH) на 10,3, 10,1 років QALY відповідно. The problem of the occupational health of teachers in Ukraine is currently underestimated [1, 5, 12]. Although the national doctrine of educational development determines the accelerated, proactive and innovate educational development in the first quarter of the 21 century, which, accordingly, will increase the risk of occupational pathology of teachers [4]. This problem is not unique to Ukraine, but is being developed by scientists all over the world [7, 8, 10, 11]. The number of people in need of phoniatric help is constantly increasing. These include professional actors, singers, radio and television announcers, teachers, and service workers [2, 9]. People with voice problems are of working age (20-60 years), so voice rehabilitation is socially important to them [1, 3, 6]. Despite the number of scientific researches, the least studied question is lowering risk of progression of voce pathology based on a comprehensive system of management of teachers’ occupational risks, which was determined as an object of research. MATERIALS AND METHODS OF RESEARCH Hygienic, epidemiological, sanitary-statistical, in-depth medical examination method and mathematical-statistical methods were applied in the research. The stages and scope of the research are shown in Figure 1. The study and evaluation of conditions were performed by classical hygienic methods. The likelihood of occupational laryngitis was calculated according to a standard methodology for determining risk (Izmer N.F., Denisov E.I., 2003), based on the analysis of ambulatory charts of 63 teachers with voice apparatus disease associated with working conditions. The health of 93 teachers was assessed by determining the level of features of functioning of the circulatory system and the adaptive capacity of the whole organism according to the formula (Bayevsky et al., 1987). To identify and evaluate the risks of occupational pathology, an international methodology was applied (Murtonen M., 2004; Kalkis V., 2005). Standard DALY methodology was used to determine the effectiveness of the proposed measures (Homedes N., 1996). To determine the statistical significance of the differences in the characteristics of the investigated independent samples with normal distribution, the parametric criterion t-student test for independent samples was used. In the case of distribution other than normal, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Statistical processing of the material was performed using IBM's SPSS 20.0 software for Windows і Microsoft Excel 2003 (N НК9ТК–GB4KD– 3936D–8R6С8–DJТНD) та STATISTICA 6.0. (N 31415–9265–35897). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Working conditions of teachers in general educational institutions. Work of teacher belongs to the 2 class of allowable by severity indicators (working position “standing”, forced bending of the trunk more than 30), and it belongs to 3 degree of 3 class of harm by indicators of intensity (according to calculated points 3,63) according to Order N 248 of 08.04.2014 DSN-P «Hygienic classification of labor by indicators of harm and danger of industrial environment, severity and intensity of labor process». The microclimate parameters of the teachers’ workplace, both in the warm and cold year periods very greatly, which is related to the cabinet location (floor, corner office, the location of windows), the presence or absence of central heating and belong to 1 degree 3 class of harm. While writing the materials on the blackboard, or in the case of wiping the board with a dry cloth, a dust cloud with calcium carbonate content may form, which is part of school chalk at a concentration of 0.012 mg/m to 0.068 mg/m with an average of 0.03±0.00 mg/m at the normative level – 0.05 mg/m, which belongs to 2 class of allowable. Equivalent level of noise at the workplace of scientific-natural lyceum teacher exceeds the allowable level by 35 dB, which refers to the 1 degree of the 3 class of harm. As result of the study of sanitary and microbiological parameters of the working area air in the classroom, it was found that during the shift the total microbial number gradually increases from 569.33±174.55 microorganisms in a time from 8.00-8.30 to 2333.33±209.13 microorganisms at 14.15-14.45, but МЕДИЧНІ ПЕРСПЕКТИВИ / MEDICNI PERSPEKTIVI 163 20/ Том XXV / 3 it does not exceed the requirements of sanitary standards (4500 microorganisms/m. Thus, there is gradual air pollution (during the work shift) of the teacher’s working area with bacteria. Summing up, working conditions of a secondary school teacher belongs to 3 degree of 3 class of harm according to general hygienic assessment (table 1). Fig. 1.

      "abstract": "Продовольственная безопасность — главное направление обеспечения национальной безопасности страны, сохранения ее государственности и суверенитета, важнейшая составляющая социально-экономической политики, a также необходимое условие реализации стратегического национального приоритета — повышение качества жизни российских граждан. В процессе реализации публичной власти государство разрабатывает и применяет различные методы организации и деятельности исполнительных органов власти, направленные на достижение поставленных целей, в том числе и на реализацию продовольственной доктрины. Меры административной, гражданской, уголовной ответственности должны предостерегать участников рынка, осуществляющих оборот продукции, от производства и легализации некачественной и опасной пищевой продукции, контрафакта, способного подорвать национальные интересы государства в сфере продовольственной безопасности. Когда государственно-правовых заградительных механизмов в достижении поставленной цели недостаточно, вводятся дополнительные меры, сопутствующие государственным механизмам борьбы с некачественной и опасной продукцией. Цель исследования – провести анализ дополнительных механизмов контроля за появлением на рынке некачественных и опасных товаров, а также методов борьбы с незаконной добычей водных биологических ресурсов, установить возможности этих механизмов и оценить реальную эффективность от их внедрения. Для достижения этой цели автор анализирует работу системы Россельхознадзора по выписке электронных ветеринарно-сопроводительных документов ФГИС «Меркурий», а также деятельность ООО «Оператор-ЦРПТ» по маркировке продукции и потребительской упаковки, реализующего программу «Честный знак». Новизна работы заключается в исследовании эффективности альтернативных административно-правовых механизмов, призванных решать важные государственные задачи обеспечения продовольственной безопасности, не прибегая к карательным мерам правового воздействия на участников хозяйственной деятельности.\n Food security is the main direction of ensuring the country’s national security, preserving its statehood and sovereignty, the most important component of socio-economic policy, as well as a necessary condition for the implementation of the strategic national priority - improving the quality of life of Russian citizens. In the process of exercising public power, the state develops and applies various methods of organization and activity of executive authorities aimed at achieving its goals, including the implementation of the food doctrine. Measures of administrative, civil, and criminal liability should warn market participants involved in the circulation of products against the production and legalization of low-quality and dangerous food products, counterfeit products that can undermine the national interests of the state in the field of food security. When state and legal protective mechanisms are not enough to achieve the set goal, additional measures are introduced to accompany state mechanisms for combating low-quality and dangerous products. The purpose of the study is to analyze additional mechanisms for controlling the appearance of low-quality and dangerous goods on the market, as well as methods of combating the illegal extraction of aquatic biological resources, to establish the capabilities of these mechanisms and to evaluate the real effectiveness of their implementation. To achieve this goal, the author analyzes the work of the Rosselkhoznadzor system for issuing electronic veterinary accompanying documents FSIS \"Mercury\", as well as the activities of Operator-CRPT LLC in labeling products and consumer packaging, implementing the \"Honest Sign\" program. The novelty of the work lies in the study of the effectiveness of alternative administrative and legal mechanisms designed to solve important government problems of ensuring food security without resorting to punitive measures of legal influence on participants in economic activities."

      "abstract": ": In India, almost all the road traffic consists of mixed traffic like cycles, rickshaws, auto, pull cart and so on. Nonmotorized transport (NMT) plays a dominant role as an affordable, but sometimes unpleasant and dangerous. The study is to assess the effect of Non-motorized vehicles on traffic density. The mixed traffic affects the characteristics of the traffic stream like speed, density and flows during peak hours when the flow of NMVs is high. The traffic characteristics like speed, density, and flow get affected as it is difficult to understand the behavior of traffic stream, the traffic behavior has to be understood carefully in order to design a traffic facility. In this paper, an attempt is made to study the highlights of the non-motorized vehicle and the impact on mixed traffic. of roads. He classified the level of service into six classes (A, B, C, D, E, and F). Based on the traffic characteristics of the road. The traffic characteristics considered in this study are the average speed of the passenger car and the number of passing and surpassing vehicles in the traffic stream along the section. T. developed a model on the “Performance Characteristics of Heterogeneous Traffic Streams Containing NonMotorized Vehicles.” He classified the vehicles into 2 types especially, normal vehicles and non-standard vehicles. The model to investigate the impact of various non- conventional vehicles in traffic stream performance including lane capacity. The presence of non-motorized vehicles affects the traffic stream performance because of speed capabilities, poor acceleration, etc., for heterogeneous traffic streams have the reduced link capacities and saturation flows for traffic stream containing homogeneous flow with private cars. This model was used in the study of speed flow relationships of the traffic stream. It was found that the presence of these vehicles results in traffic density and volume. 5) Todd Litman 1997-2009 conducted the study on \"Quantifying the Benefits of Nonmotorized Travel\" Containing NonMotorized Vehicles to help achieve transportation planning objectives such as congestion reduction, road and parking facility value savings, consumer cost savings, and various environmental and social benefits. The study was done on non-motorized transportation tends to leverage proportionately larger reductions in vehicle travel. It discusses strategies for evaluating the advantages of improved walking and cycling conditions, accumulated non-motorized travel, and shifts from motorized to nonmotorized modes. This analysis indicates that non-motorized travel provides important edges and that these benefits can increase with cost-effective incentives.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The increasing transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 from animals to humans underscores the urgent need for enhanced diagnostic capabilities in clinical microbiology laboratories. Although in silico analysis suggests that commercial multiplex respiratory panels can detect H5N1, these assays lack subtyping H5N1 capabilities, and their real-world performance remains largely unverified. In this study, we evaluated the limit of detection (LoD) for H5N1 using three commercial molecular diagnostic assays routinely employed at our institution: bioMérieux BioFire Respiratory 2.1 Panel, Cepheid Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV Plus, and Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assays. All three reliably detected H5N1 were at low viral concentrations. To enable H5N1 detection, we also developed a real-time RT-PCR H5 single-plex assay on the Hologic Panther Fusion Open Access platform for reflex testing of influenza A-positive specimens. In conclusion, although current commercial assays lack influenza A H5 subtype differentiation, our validation data provide critical performance information. When integrated with a targeted H5 assay, these tools can enhance clinical decision-making and public health surveillance by reducing the risk of missed H5N1 infection cases. IMPORTANCE This study addresses a growing public health concern: the spread of bird flu (H5N1) from animals to humans. Most hospital laboratories use commercial tests to detect respiratory viruses like the flu, but these tests cannot tell if someone has the specific and more dangerous H5N1 strain. To help solve this, we tested three commonly used diagnostic tools and found that they can detect H5N1 even at low levels. However, since they cannot identify the specific H5 subtype, we also developed and validated a follow-up test that runs on one of the existing laboratory high-throughput equipment. This test can confirm whether a patient infected with the flu has the H5N1 strain. By combining these tools, hospital laboratories can improve early detection of H5N1, support better patient care, and help public health officials respond more effectively to outbreaks."

      "abstract": ": This study presents an NLP-based predictive model for identifying and presenting similar construction accident scenarios with the aim of enhancing safety and health management. The construction industry is recognized as one of the most dangerous industries worldwide with a high fatality rate. In Korea, work-related fatalities in the construction sector are 3.09 times higher on average than those in the manufacturing industry from 2013 to 2022 (Ministry of Employment and Labor in Korea, 2023). To reduce accidents, stakeholder involvement in safety and health (S&H) management systems is crucial. Despite government interventions, accident prevention is limited due to stakeholders’ constrained S&H management capabilities. One of the most effective ways to improve stakeholders’ S&H management capabilities is to make them aware of accidents that may occur during construction work, and the hazards that cause them. Therefore, this study proposes a model that presents accident scenarios at construction sites to stakeholders. To address this issue, an accident prediction model was developed for the construction industry using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model was trained on 18,000 accident cases collected by the Korea Authority of Land and Infrastructure Safety and contained variables such as accident type, time, weather, work type, and number of fatalities and injuries. The model was used the BERT model. The model performance was qualitatively evaluated by construction S&H experts who assessed its interpretability, relevance, and applicability in real-world construction scenarios. The S&H experts’ feedback helped refine the model to ensure its effectiveness in predicting accidents and presenting similar scenarios. Stakeholders input construction site information, such as process rate, construction period, cost, weather, and work details, in natural language. The model retrieves accident information from similar sites based on embedded data and calculates a similarity score using cosine similarity. This score helps stakeholders to evaluate the relevance of accident scenarios to their sites. The model also provides site information at the time of an accident, thereby offering a valuable context. By examining the similarity score and on-site information, stakeholders can assess the likelihood of a proposed accident occurring at their construction site, thereby enabling them to develop targeted measures to prevent potential accidents and enhance S&H management in the construction industry. This study contributes to the improvement of the S&H management capabilities of construction stakeholders and proposes a novel approach to improving stakeholder awareness of potential accidents and hazards. Despite these promising results, there are limitations to be addressed in future research. The model’s performance could be improved by incorporating additional variables and data sources and expanding its applicability to a wider range of construction activities and industries."

      "abstract": "A well constructed plan-docheck-act (PDCA) tool, in the context of a Safety Management System (SMS), and incorporating a structured field survey, can help students prepare for real-world problems, situations and crises in general aviation (GA) security by providing an actual professional environment to study. Thus, through the examination of an actual GA airport, students are given the opportunity to work issues through the trials, tribulations, experiences, and research findings of others. In this paper all the elements of GA airport security plan are analyzed at the collegiate level. It is suggested that this PDCA tool be implemented as a SMS model for the study of future ahport security c o m e s used in the collegiate environment. Introduction to General Aviation Security Providing effective general aviation (GA) security is a complex problem because of the size of an airport, the diversity among users, and the unpredictable nature of terrorism. A comprehensive SMS approach to all elements of GA security is a goal to strive for while recognizing the complexity of airport security programs. Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations will continue to evolve as new technologies and capabilities are developed; as will the protocols for GA security measures to prevent terrorist acts against the United States (Transportation Security Administration, 2008) According to the FAA (200) the background of SMS stems fiom a systematic, proactive, and well-defined safety program. A SMS approach: . . . allows an organization producing a product or service to strike a realistic and efficient balance between safety and production. The forecast growth in air transportation will require new measures and a greater effort h m all aviation producers-including airport operators-in order to achieve a continuing improvement in the level of aviation safety. The use of SMS at airports can contribute to this effort by increasing the likelihood that airport operators will detect and correct safety problems before those problems result in an aircraft accident or incident. (7 1) Role of the Transportation Security Administration The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is required to prescribe rules to protect persons and property on aircra& against acts of criminal violence and aircraft piracy, and to prescribe rules for weening passengers and property for dangerous weapons, explosives, and destructive substances. To cany out the provisions of the Aviation Transportation and Security Act of 2001 (ATSA), the TSA has adopted former FAA rules requiring airport operators, air carriers, indirect air carriers, and foreign air carriers to cany out various duties for civil aviation security. Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), incorporates the following Transportation Security Regulations (TSRs) that concern aviation security: Part 1542 applies to certain airport operators; Part 1544 governs certain air carriers; Part 1546 applies to the operation of foreign air carriers; and Part 1548 applies to indirect air caniers such as bight forwarders, who engage indirectly in air transportation of property within the United States and sometimes operate out of GA facilities (Quilly, 2005; Transportation Security Administration, 2008). JAAER, Winter 2010 Page 35 35 Rankin: General Aviation Security: A Safety Management System Model for C Published by Scholarly Commons, 2010 General Aviation Security TSR Parts 1520,1540,1542 and 1548 Part 1520 forbids the disclosure of information that may compromise or be harmful to the safety and security of the traveling public. Additionally, the regulation sets forth the rules that allow the federal government to withhold information from public disclosure even when requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), in litigation, or in rulemaking. Airport operators and air carriers are required to restrict the availability of infomation contained in security programs to those with a need-to-know. This need-to-know is defined by the Airport Security Program. Under this Part, airport management must withhold sensitive security information (SSI) fiom unauthorized disclosure. If SSI is released to unauthorized persons, the TSA must be notified. Tbis permits the TSA to evaluate the risk presented by the release of the information, and to take whatever actions may be needed to mitigate that risk (Quilty, 2005; Transportation Security Administration, 2008). New Part 1540 outlines the rules that apply to all segments of civil aviation security and includes rules that govern individuals and other persons. This regulation applies both to individuals who work at the airport and to the passengers using airports. Part 1540 also outlines definitions and terms used in Parts 1542, 1548 and others. For example, the widely used term escort is given a definition within this regulation. Another significant addition to the regulatory language is the inclusion of individual accountability. The TSA believes that \"the contribution of individuals to the success of the civil aviation security program cannot be over-emphasized,\" and for that reason the \"agency believes that holding individuals accountable for their security violations will serve as a direct and effective corrective action and may prove to be a positive deterrent7' (Quilty, 2005, p.8). The TSA believes that by incorporating a level of individual responsibility in tandem with existing airport security programs a higher level of aviation security integrity will be ensured (Quilty, 2005) The TSRs contain general requirements for promoting civil aviation security. Each airport operator, air carrier, foreign air carrier, and indirect air carrier covered by these parts is required to have a security program that contains information that specifies how they will perfom their regulatory and statutory responsibilities. Again, all these security programs are available only to those persons having a need-to-know (Quilty, 2005; Transportation Security Administration, 2008) TSR Part 1 542 Airport Security prescribes rules for airport operators servicing and facilitating U.S. certificated air carriers, foreign air carriers, and both foreign and domestic air cargo carriers. The purpose of Part 1542 is to prevent any act of unlawful interference with the safety of persons and goods in air transportation. To accomplish this goal, the TSA has extended its security regulations to airports as the first practical line of defense (Quilty, 2005; Transportation Security Administration, 2008) The TSA's congressionally authorized area of jurisdiction and responsibility focuses on protecting persons and property in air transportation against acts of criminal violence, air piracy, and terrorism. However, to effect security of aircI.aft in-flight, the TSA extends security measures to the airport operator by requiring airport management to regulate the movement of persons and vehicles having access to all aircraft while on the ground and within the airport boundary. In all respects, the security of civil aviation operations begins at an airport's perimeter fence and terminal building interface (Quilty, 2005; Transportation Security Administration, 2008) Part 1548, indirect air carrier security pmgram, covers security procedures for cargo that are accepted for transport on aircraft. In general, indirect air carriers are required to carry out security procedures for handling cargo that will be carried on aircraft (QuiIty, 2005; Transportation Security Administration, 2008) Aviation Security Advisory Committee Recognizing the need for tighter GA security at the nation's airports to pmtect against terrorist threats, vandalism, and other illegal acts on aviation, in April 2003 the TSA requested the Aviation Security Advisory Committee (ASAC) of general aviation professional trade associations such as the Aimaft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), National Business Aircraft Association (NBAA), and American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), etc. to establish a working group made up of industry stakeholders to develop guidelines for security enhancements for GA operations and airports. The working group consisted of the trade associations, airport operators, and state and federal government representatives. Members of the working group engaged in extensive meetings to review GA airport security recommendations and to develop a list of GA bestpractices.

      "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and dangerous types of cancer globally, caused by unrepaired DNA damage leading to abnormal cell growth in the epidermis. Melanoma, in particular, is one of the most hazardous forms, requiring early and precise diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Early detection and diagnosis are vital for reducing the mortality rates associated with this aggressive cancer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines an anisotropic median filter (AMF) with a modified vision transformer, termed the Multinomial Classification Vision Transformer (MCVT) for skin cancer classification. The AMF is used as pre‐processing to effectively remove noise and enhance image quality, preserving critical features essential for accurate classification. On the other hand, the MCVT leverages its robust feature extraction capabilities to classify melanoma with high accuracy. We utilized the HAM10000 dataset for training and evaluation. Our proposed method outperforms existing state‐of‐the‐art techniques, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91% and a melanoma classification accuracy of 89%. These results demonstrate the potential of integrating AMF and MCVT to enhance skin cancer classification, with a particular focus on improving melanoma detection."

A combination of ensemble learning approaches primarily includes Random Forest together with Gradient Boosting and Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) exists to provide full-scale threat detection capabilities. The system employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) together with other dimensionality reduction methods for better processing performance. The framework achieves 99% accuracy together with 94% precision, 91% recall and a 95% F1-score during evaluation. The proposed approach provides instant classification and implements automated response functions which differ from delayed reactive systems that need manual human involvement. The framework demonstrates future readiness through its design that supports growth and it will enhance its capabilities by integrating deep learning models together with adaptive learning systems during its development phase. This integrated method unites numerous safety detection systems into one unified solution leading to improved cybersecurity functions beside decreased tool dependence for security operations."

      "abstract": "In Germany more than 17,000 people die per year because of ”medical errors”, in the USA it is about 98,000. The number of avoidable malpractice cases or major complications is about tenfold higher. Nearly everyone will be a patient in a hospital sooner or later. A key concept to improve patient safety are modern, anonymous adverse event reporting systems in hospitals. These are known as incident reporting systems. The introduction of modern process-oriented technologies optimizes the efficiency of such systems and increases patient safety. IT saves lives, if it is possible to improve the analysis of medical incidents and to accelerate the detection of the underlying causes by optimizing the IRS processes. In this paper we present a generic process-oriented architecture and its application for incident reporting systems in health care organizations. Further, we formulate lessons learned concerning business process modeling and implementation for process-oriented architectures. 1 INCIDENT REPORTING IN HEALTH CARE Since the report ”to err is human” published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (Institute of Medicine, 1999), it is well known that up to 98,000 people die each year because of medical errors. In many countries medical errors are among the ten leading causes of death (Kohn, 2006). The number of avoidable major complications is about tenfold higher. Cases with injury to the patient are only the tip of the iceberg. The avoidance of medical errors increases patient safety. Unfortunately, there is little knowledge about the error mechanisms in health care. A main reason for errors in medicine is the failure to apply medical knowledge in imperfect, real world conditions of patient care and not the missing medical knowledge itself (Rall and Gaba, 2005). Incident reporting systems (IRS) facilitate the continuous collection of data for a systematic analysis. Presently available systems do not collect the necessary amount and quality of data. The amount of unreported and therefore not systematically analyzed incidents is estimated to be between 50% and 96% (Institute of Medicine, 1999; Leape, 1994; Cullen et al., 1995). Furthermore, ten years after the before-mentioned IOM report, medical IRS still have major problems to induct a fast realization of useful recommendations. Because the analysis of the incidents is not comprehensive enough, decisions are often made without sufficient knowledge of environmental conditions and various other factors. These quick fixes can have unintentional side effects and even worsen the situation (O’Reilley, 2009). Reported incidents are a window to the surrounding health care system (Vincent, 2006). Looking into this window gives the chance to detect dangerous constellations which may be the root causes of the reported incidents. Sometimes such factors do not actually correspond directly to the reported incident, but without this reporting no one would have ever questioned the detected nuisance. Eliminating the deeper problem behind the incident means to improve the situation for the given incident and moreover, for similar or dependant situations. In order to reduce the risk of adverse events all underlying factors and their relations have to be observed (Leape et al., 1991). The World Health Organization (WHO) published guidelines for adverse event reporting and learning systems (WHO, 2011). The most important aspects are organizational integration, data security, 219 Schmollinger M., Stricker E., Bazlen T., Eßlinger T., Röhl C. and Walter B..

Some characteristics of successful reporting systems can also be derived from Leape (Leape, 2002) and Cohen (Cohen, 2000): e.g. non-punitive, confidential, professional analysis, timely, systems-oriented and responsive. 1.1 Patient Safety Information System The Tübingen Center of Patient Safety and Simulation (TüPASS) at the university hospital Tübingen develops and administrates the interprofessional IRS PaSIS (Patient Safety Information System) (Dieckmann et al., 2006). PaSIS is widely accepted with more than 70 participating hospitals and about 30 rescue helicopter bases in Central Europe. More than 3000 incidents have been reported. All reports undergo a foureye anonymization process by neutral domain experts trained in incident reporting and using checklist protocols to prevent any lapses. After that the reports are professionally analyzed in order to find the causes and factors for the medical error. Within this process, it is possible to pose questions to the anonymous reporter. The result is prepared for the different user groups and recommendations are derived from the analysis. The implementation of the recommendations is supported and evaluated throughout the system. PaSIS is a classical web application based on Apache, PHP and MySQL. The complete incident reporting process for each hospital beginning with reporting step, anonymization, posing questions to reporters, analyzing and suggesting recommendations is hard wired in the program code. Each customization of the system is associated with time-consuming, error-prone manual programming. Moreover, it is not possible to execute processes of different versions at the same time. Changes to the process are very complex, because the data of all pending processes have to be adapted to the new one. 2 PROCESS-ORIENTATION IN INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEMS The success of an incident reporting system depends on the optimal cooperation of all its stakeholders. Stakeholders are all kinds of users (medical personnel, domain experts, quality managers of hospitals), developers and administrators. Long-running processes are common in medical incident reporting systems. Ideally, the process behind an incident report is adapted to the corresponding hospital, because they differ in size and organization. A precondition for that is the cooperation between clinical personnel or managers and IT specialists responsible for the IRS. Business process management (BPM) technologies and methodologies are the key to successfully fulfilling this task. BPM is a systematic approach to capture, arrange, document, measure, monitor and steer automatic and non-automatic processes in order to reach the goals of the organization (van der Aalst et al., 2003; European Association of Business Process Management, ). A business process management system (BPMS) supports the BPM life cycle, which consists of the four major steps: process design, system configuration, process enactment and diagnosis (van der Aalst et al., 2003). The life cycle supports continual improvement of business processes. Modern approaches provide methods and technologies to get business people naturally involved in the BPM life cycle. First of all, graphical notations like OMG’s Business Model an Notation (BPMN) (Object Management Group, 2011; White and Miers, 2008) can be used to design process models without programming skills. The resulting business process models can be augmented by technical details ideally using the same notation. The execution of the detailed process model is done by a process engine that coordinates user interaction with the running processes by a web application (Ouyang et al., 2009). Although, there is an increasing need in health care to support patient-oriented processes, BPM technology is rarely used. Especially for IRS web applications, the embedding of process-oriented technologies has several advantages over conventionally implemented web applications. Namely, improved transparency of IRS processes, complete involvement of all IRS participants in the processes’s life cycle, easier maintenance and extendibility, faster ”time to market” for individual IRS processes of new participating hospitals, flexible change management, support of several process versions per hospital and enhanced process monitoring capabilities that help improving reaction times. In (Schmollinger et al., 2011), we proposed a general methodology to systematically incorporate process oriented technologies into web applications. Furthermore, we sketched a process-oriented target architecture based on open source products and showed how to implement processes with an adequate tool chain using a simplified incident reporting process. The used modeling strategy provides three types of models. First, the strategic model. It describes the main participants (user roles and systems) and the order of their main activities. It disregards all the special cases and exceptional or error conditions of the real process. Second, the operative process model is much HEALTHINF 2012 International Conference on Health Informatics"

      "abstract": "The objective of this project is to create a simulation for air cargo inspection using artificial intelligence (AI). This will be achieved by combining Pygame for simulating conveyor belts and YOLOv8 for detecting hazardous items. The simulation replicates a conveyor belt system that transports air cargo for inspection. Pygame, a robust game development package, is used to build a graphically interactive environment where users may view and examine the cargo inspection process in a simulated context. The primary element of the project entails using YOLOv8, an advanced object detection model, to precisely locate dangerous things within the shipment. The real-time detection capabilities of YOLOv8 allow for quick and efficient examination of the cargo, ensuring the timely identification of any hazards. The simulation serves as a platform to assess and verify the effectiveness of the AI-driven cargo inspection system across different scenarios. Users have the ability to engage with the simulation by modifying factors like the speed of the conveyor belt, the types of cargo, and the criteria for inspection. This allows them to assess the effectiveness of the system in identifying dangerous objects. This project functions as an instructional tool to comprehend the incorporation of AI in cargo inspection, while also having practical implications for improving real-world air cargo security. Pygame and YOLOv8, when combined, offer a flexible and robust framework for simulating and evaluating AI-based inspection systems. This contributes to the progress of air cargo safety and security measures."

      "abstract": "This research aims to analyze the enhancement of the Indonesian National Police Mobile Brigade Corps (Korps Brimob Polri) in handling terrorism threats involving Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) materials, to support the implementation of Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW). CBRN-based terrorism has become a serious threat in Indonesia and internationally, with increasing attacks using these dangerous materials from 2011 to 2019. Korbrimob, as the elite unit of the Indonesian National Police (Polri), plays a strategic role in addressing these threats. However, further development is needed in organizational capacity, human resources, equipment, and inter-agency coordination to improve handling effectiveness. This research employs a qualitative approach using SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to evaluate the internal and external factors that influence Korbrimob’s capability in dealing with CBRN terrorism. Data was collected through interviews with stakeholders, document analysis, and field observations. Data validation was performed through triangulation techniques to ensure the accuracy of the research findings. The key findings of this study indicate that while Korbrimob Polri has established specialized CBRN units across Indonesia, several weaknesses persist, including equipment limitations, lack of adequate training, and ineffective synergy with relevant agencies, including the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) and the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT). Korbrimob’s main strength lies in its personnel capabilities and cross-sectoral cooperation, but weaknesses in authority and resources hinder the necessary capacity improvements. This research recommends increasing Korbrimob’s authority in handling CBRN, developing specialized equipment, and enhancing joint training frequency with TNI and other relevant agencies to improve readiness in facing CBRN-based terrorism threats."

      "abstract": "Marine magnetometers are promising means of monitoring the water area with an estimated presence of potentially dangerous underwater objects. They are successfully used when searching for underwater objects in conditions of the ineffectiveness of sonar tools: in shallow water, in any media (water, soil) and, especially, at the boundaries of these media. As a rule, the search for an underwater object using magnetometric means is carried out along the “orthogonal tacks” trajectory, the main characteristics of which are the search bandwidth (depending on the magnetic characteristics of the underwater object) and the length of a searching tack. An analysis of the development trends of marine magnetometers revealed the following main directions: the expansion of their functional capabilities, the increase in the sensitivity of magnetic field sensors, and the increase in mass and dimensional characteristics. However, in accordance with modern requirements, the main directions of development of marine magnetometry tools have changed radically. It has been established that the process of detecting an underwater ferromagnetic object by mobile magnetometers is stochastic in nature, which is not taken into account by the traditional method of determining the recommended search band for an underwater object, which leads to the risk of missing it. Therefore, the actual problem of improving search magnetometric means is the development of a methodological apparatus for evaluating the efficiency of detection of underwater objects. A new (probabilistic) approach to the information processing algorithm of the magnetometer signal is proposed, which determines the width of the recommended search band of an object with guaranteed values of the probability characteristics of its detection. The article indicates a problem."

In addition, the effect of a follower jammer on frequency hopping link is modeled and simulated. The computer application determines safe and dangerous routes between two radios: transmitter and receiver in presence of a follower jammer. The application calculates link budget equations and colors the route depends on predefined specifications which are specified by the user. Initially user chooses waveform type and locates three main nodes' coordinates: transmitter, receiver, and jammer on an interactive map with their specifications such as operating mode, transmitted power, and hopping range. Also, locates sub points between transmitter and receiver which represent radio movements. These points form the route between transmitter and receiver radios."

      "abstract": "As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses."

      "abstract": "In a routine walk home from work, the urgency of personal safety was highlighted by a sudden confrontation and theft. This incident sparked the motivation for this research, with an emphasis on the imperative need for enhanced protection for all individuals. Addressing the escalating concern of crime, a system adept at detecting anomalous human activities is presented in our research, aiming to significantly bolster crime prevention measures. Integrated with a responsive Telegram bot, our solution springs into action when a detected activity exceeds a 90% confidence threshold. The nature of this activity is then evaluated by the system's decision tree: if it is classified as anomalous, the relevant authorities are immediately contacted by the bot, ensuring swift intervention. Conversely, non-anomalous activities result in non-dangerous activities. This dual-response mechanism enhances the system's versatility, making it apt for a wide range of environments, from bustling public spaces to residential areas. The proposed system's impressive accuracy rate of 92.20% in identifying malicious activity is essential to its effectiveness. This commendable precision is achieved by harnessing the UCF-Crime dataset, a comprehensive collection of surveillance footage annotated for various types of crimes. Further bolstering our system's capabilities is the integration of the Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) model. LRCN stands out for its proficiency in amalgamating spatial and temporal features from video data, granting our system a heightened sensitivity in detecting subtle, yet critical, behavioural anomalies."

      "abstract": "Skin cancer, which primarily impacts skin exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays against the sun, represents dangerous to the most significant organs in the human body, the skin. Usually, a spot, lump, or mole that appears on the skin is the primary suspicion of skin cancer. However, each of these can undergo changes in coloring or shape as time passes. Recovery for skin cancer is mostly possible if the disease is discovered early. Numerous medical diagnostic methods, such as Dermoscopy, biopsy, and ocular examination of the affected area, are useful in helping anticipate the development of skin cancer. However, these approaches have the disadvantage of delivering erroneous results because it is extremely difficult to distinguish between normal and malignant skin. Therefore, the drawback of these diagnostic procedures is that machine learning algorithms are currently used together with image processing techniques to examine the images for the purpose of precisely identifying skin cancer. The current research employs the ISIC dataset to develop a novel model for skin cancer classification that combines image processing techniques with advanced machine learning methods, including Crammer-Singer Support vector machine learning algorithms. The categorization of skin cancer begins with preprocessing the input image, which includes hair removal using a morphological filter and image enhancement using a median filter to minimize noise and increase image clarity. The ABCD approach is used to segment lesion images by evaluating them for asymmetry, border irregularity, color variability, and diameter. The crammer-Singer SVM algorithm is then used with these images to classify skin lesions into various types such as melanoma (MEL), melanocytic nevus (NV), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), actinic keratosis (AK), benign keratosis (BKL), dermatofibroma (DF), vascular lesion (VASC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), leveraging its robust multi-class handling capabilities. The system achieves the maximum accuracy of 98.2% for image classification and outperforms existing approaches for skin cancer classification."

To enhance these, to make sufferer easy with timely and best remedial care.EEG systems are closely relevant on the performance using wireless system because of its more capabilities. But it has various disadvantages like line frequency interference and signal loss,. Currently there is usage of RF in healthcare environment and medical test centre which have dangerous for the health of the patients. So we are in need of alternative eco-friendly source of communication in health care. So the alternative way is proposed here is the VLC (Visible Light Communication) transmission technology that uses white LED for data transmission which has efficiency, reliability and high precision. The ADC produces data stream of EEG signal which is modulated using OOK .Here LED works as a transmitter and photodiode with sensor works as receiver and uses computer simulation for further evaluation."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nPneumonia represents a dangerous respiratory illness that leads to severe health problems when proper diagnosis does not occur, followed by an increase in deaths, particularly among at-risk populations. Appropriate treatment requires the correct identification of pneumonia types in conjunction with swift and accurate diagnosis.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis paper presents the deep learning framework SqueezeViX-Net, specifically designed for pneumonia classification. The model benefits from a Self-Optimized Adaptive Enhancement (SOAE) method, which makes programmed changes to the dropout rate during the training process. The adaptive dropout adjustment mechanism leads to better model suitability and stability. The evaluation of SqueezeViX-Net is conducted through the analysis of extensive X-ray and CT image collections derived from publicly accessible Kaggle repositories.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSqueezeViX-Net outperformed various established deep learning architectures, including DenseNet-121, ResNet-152V2, and EfficientNet-B7, when evaluated in terms of performance. The model demonstrated better results, as it performed with higher accuracy levels, surpassing both precision and recall metrics, as well as the F1-score metric.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe validation process of this model was conducted using a range of pneumonia data sets, comprising both CT images and X-ray images, which demonstrated its ability to handle modality variations.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSqueezeViX-Net integrates SOAE technology to develop an advanced framework that enables the specific identification of pneumonia for clinical use. The model demonstrates excellent diagnostic potential for medical staff through its dynamic learning capabilities and high precision, contributing to improved patient treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "Floods are considered to be among the most dangerous and destructive geohazards, leading to human victims and severe economic outcomes. Yearly, many regions around the world suffer from devasting floods. The estimation of flood aftermaths is one of the high priorities for the global community. One such flood took place in northern Libya in September 2023. The presented study is aimed at evaluating the flood aftermath for Derna city, Libya, using high resolution GEOEYE-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine environment. The primary task is obtaining and analyzing data that provide high accuracy and detail for the study region. The main objective of study is to explore the capabilities of different algorithms and remote sensing datasets for quantitative change estimation after the flood. Different supervised classification methods were examined, including random forest, support vector machine, naïve-Bayes, and classification and regression tree (CART). The various sets of hyperparameters for classification were considered. The high-resolution GEOEYE-1 images were used for precise change detection using image differencing (pixel-to-pixel comparison and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) for extracting building), whereas Sentinel-2 data were employed for the classification and further change detection by classified images. Object based image analysis (OBIA) was also performed for the extraction of building footprints using very high resolution GEOEYE images for the quantification of buildings that collapsed due to the flood. The first stage of the study was the development of a workflow for data analysis. This workflow includes three parallel processes of data analysis. High-resolution GEOEYE-1 images of Derna city were investigated for change detection algorithms. In addition, different indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), transformed NDVI (TNDVI), and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI)) were calculated to facilitate the recognition of damaged regions. In the final stage, the analysis results were fused to obtain the damage estimation for the studied region. As the main output, the area changes for the primary classes and the maps that portray these changes were obtained. The recommendations for data usage and further processing in Google Earth Engine were developed."

      "abstract": "The overall theme of this project was to increase the speed of analysis for monitoring pesticide residues in food. Traditionally, analytical methods for multiple pesticides are time-consuming, expensive, laborious, wasteful, and ineffective to meet critical needs related to food safety. Faster and better methods were needed to provide more cost-effective detection of chemical contaminants, and thus provide a variety of benefits to agriculture. This overarching goal to speed and improve pesticide analysis was successfully accomplished even beyond what was originally proposed by the investigators in 1998. At that time, the main objectives of this project were: 1) to further develop a direct sample introduction (DSI) device that enables fast sampling and introduction of blended-only agricultural products for analysis by gas chromatography (GC); 2) to evaluate, establish, and further develop the method of simultaneous pulsed flame photometric detector (PFPD) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection for enhanced pesticide identification capabilities; and 3) to develop a new and novel MS pesticide analysis method, based on the use of supersonic molecular beams (SMB) for sampling and ionization. The first and third objectives were successfully accomplished as proposed, and the feasibility of the second objective was already demonstrated. The capabilities of the GC/SMB-MS approach alone were so useful for pesticide analysis that the simultaneous use of a PFPD was considered superfluous. Instead, the PFPD was investigated in combination with an electron-capture detector for low-cost, simultaneous analysis of organophosphorus and organochlorine pesticides in fatty foods. Three important, novel research projects not originally described in the proposal were also accomplished: 1) development of the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method for pesticides in foods; 2) development and optimization of a method using low-pressure (LP) GC/MS to speed pesticide residue analysis; and 3) innovative application of analyte protectants to improve the GC analysis of important problematic pesticides. All of the accomplishments from this project are expected to have strong impact to the analytical community and implications to agriculture and food safety. For one, an automated DSI approach has become commercially available in combination with GC/MS for the analysis of pesticide residues. Meanwhile, the PFPD has become the selective detector of choice for the analysis of organophosphorus pesticides. Great strides were made in SMB-MS through the manufacture of a prototype \"Supersonic GC/MS\" instrument, which displayed many advantages over commercial GC/MS instruments. Most notably, the QuEChERS method is already being disseminated to routine monitoring labs and has shown great promise to improve pesticide analytical capabilities and increase lab productivity. The implications of these developments to agriculture will be to increase the percentage of food monitored and the scope of residues detected in the food, which will serve to improve food safety. Developed and developing countries alike will be able to use these methods to lower costs and improve results, thus imported/exported food products will have better quality without affecting price or availability. This will help increase trade between nations and mitigate certain disputes over residue levels in imported foods. The improved enforcement of permissible residue levels provided by these methods will have the effect to promote good agricultural practices among previously obstinate farmers who felt no repercussions from illegal or harmful practices. Furthermore, the methods developed can be used in the field to analyze samples quickly and effectively, or to screen for high levels of dangerous chemicals that may intentionally or accidentally appear in the food supply.   "

      "abstract": "The automatic detection of dangerous goods in X-ray baggage images is a crucial task in the field of industrial security. This paper proposes a novel dangerous goods detection network (DGDN) designed to address the challenges of detecting dangerous goods in complex X-ray baggage images. In the network, a multilevel refinement (MR) module is designed to improve multi-level feature representation, enabling the network to capture varied goods sizes and overlapping structures effectively. Specifically, the selective spatial-channel adaptive module (SSCAM) introduces dynamically adaptive weights across spatial and channel dimensions, allowing the network to focus on critical features more effectively and thereby improving detection accuracy. In the experiments, the performance of the proposed DGDN is evaluated by using the mean average precision (mAP) metric on the SIXray and PIDray datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DGDN achieves mAP scores of 91.9% and 69.4% on the SIXray and PIDray datasets, respectively. Compared with some state-of-the-art methods, our network improves performance by 5–10% while reducing parameters and increasing computational efficiency. These indicate that DGDN has good potential application capabilities."

      "abstract": "This research investigates the dynamics of national connectivity, with an emphasis on its implications for economic, social, and environmental aspects. A review of the literature reveals that globally, there is no standard way of measuring connectivity, which drove the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to create the Sustainable Inland Transport Connectivity Indicators (SITCIN). This novel approach consists of a range of indicators spread across 40 thematic clusters to evaluate sustainability. The focus shifts to Palestine, where road transport dominates while plans are underway for multimodal transportation systems. The distinct political setting in Palestine characterized by different levels of control over land, roads, and borders necessitates an adapted methodology for diagnosing and analyzing the national linkage process. Based on the data collected from official sources, questionnaires for thirteen key stakeholders, and interviews, indicators were identified, and the data were collected. Palestine’s SITCIN analysis showed a moderate weighted sustainability score of 42.7%, which indicates socioeconomic-political limitations. The safety and security, infrastructure, and transportation of perishable goods/dangerous materials have relatively higher scores, whereas intermodality and environmental sustainability face considerable challenges. The study recommends investing in individual and organizational capabilities, embracing technological advancements, comprehensive multimodal transport planning, environmental monitoring, and road safety initiatives. Furthermore, stringent regulation of emissions and vehicle noise, establishment of a centralized transportation databank, and streamlined information exchange among pertinent authorities are also recommended. This study underscores the necessity of periodic updates to SITCIN indicators to align with the evolving transport landscape."

      "abstract": "Illegal enrichment, as a manifestation of corruption, is a direct threat to Ukraine’s national security. As a result of illegal enrichment, damage is done not only to the rights and freedoms of citizens and legal entities, but also to the authority of authorities and business entities on whose behalf authorized persons act. The fight against such a dangerous criminally illegal manifestation cannot remain outside the attention of scientists and is implemented through the development of a high-quality scientific toolkit for law enforcement activities in the form of methods of investigating illegal enrichment. An important element of the methodology of the investigation of illegal enrichment is the using of special knowledge, which significantly expands the capabilities of the subject of the investigation to establish factual data relevant to the proceedings. The purpose of the article is to offer forensic recommendations on the using of special knowledge in the investigation of illegal enrichment. The main results of the study are the formation of forensic recommendations on the using of special knowledge for gathering evidence during the investigation of illegal enrichment, the results of which are reflected in the procedural sources of evidence. Analysis of the nature, purpose and tasks of the procedural actions of the initial stage of the investigation of illegal enrichment – inspection, temporary access to things and documents, criminal search – allows us to conclude that it is necessary to involve a specialist in their implementation. A specialist who is involved in the implementation of such procedural actions not only has particular tasks, but must also have certain qualifications that will act as a guarantee of the performance of these tasks. The results of the involvement of a specialist in procedural actions should be reflected in the form of a written explanation of the specialist, which takes its place in the system of procedural sources of evidence. Conducting various types of forensic examinations during the investigation of illegal enrichment allows establishing factual data that are important for the proceedings. Examinations should be carried out taking into account the peculiarities of the organization of forensic expert activity in Ukraine and the related capabilities of the subject of the investigation to conduct certain types of forensic examinations. At the same time, it is important to form a methodical approach to conducting examinations and evaluating the expert’s conclusions, the basis of which is the normative and legal regulation of forensic expert activity in Ukraine. The proposed forensic recommendations are a guarantee of collecting proper and admissible evidence and increasing the effectiveness of the investigation of illegal enrichment."

      "abstract": "Introduction. Special conditions for the activity of specialists of the naval crews are often «forced» to function at the limit of the physiological capabilities of the body, requiring constant maintenance of a high level of physical working capacity. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of combined physical and normobaric hypoxic training for an emergency increase in the physical endurance of ship specialists and other representatives of «dangerous» occupations. Materials and methods. Were examined 18 men (10 people — the main group, 8 people — the control group) aged 19–22 years. The subjects of both groups performed workouts on exercise bikes: work power 1,2 W/kg, duration 2 hours, the total number of training sessions 14. For people of the main group, physical training was carried out under conditions of normobaric hypoxia created in the normobaric hypoxic complex, with an oxygen content of about 16% (15,9 kPa). In persons of the control group, hypoxia conditions were imitated: atmospheric air was supplied to the premises of the hypoxic complex. The physical endurance of the subjects was evaluated by the maximum oxygen consumption indicator. Results and its discussion. The studies revealed that the effectiveness of training in individuals of the main group turned out to be significantly higher compared to the control, as evidenced by the results of control tests of physical endurance, carried out both immediately after the training and in the long-term observation period. Thus, the method of combined physical and normobaric hypoxic training can be considered as an effective and safe means of emergency and persistent increase in physical endurance of ship specialists and of other categories of people with difficult and dangerous working conditions."

      "abstract": "Robots are now essential in unreachable, repeated, and dangerous real-world applications where they take place of human beings. One of the important capabilities of a multi-robot system is that it should be able to form an autonomous robot network to transmit information. However, due to the limited communication capability of a single robot, the highly variable environment where robots work, and the mobility of the robots, it is difficult for them to exchange information with each other in need. In this article, we propose a novel robot network routing protocol based on multi-agent reinforcement learning called MAQR. The robot nodes can deliver packets cooperatively. The mobility factor, buffer status, and packet delay of neighbor nodes are taken into consideration. We design a reliability model for a robot agent to make reliable routing decisions. We also design an adaptive exploration-exploitation method to balance the convergence speed, solution space as well as network fluctuation. The routing algorithm has been implemented and evaluated in simulation. Results show that MAQR can provide less packet delay, less average queue length and higher delivery ratio than other Q-learning based routing protocol."

Attempting to replicate this in vision-language models (VLMs) presents two challenges: VLMs can produce harmful behavior, which is particularly dangerous for VLM-controlled robots which interact with the world, but imposing behavioral safeguards can limit their functional and ethical extents. We conduct two case studies on safeguarding VLMs which generate forceful robotic motion, finding that safeguards reduce both harmful and helpful behavior involving contact-rich manipulation of human body parts. Then, we discuss the key implication of this result--that value alignment may impede desirable robot capabilities--for model evaluation and robot learning."

      "abstract": "Prominent AI companies are producing'safety frameworks'as a type of voluntary self-governance. These statements purport to establish risk thresholds and safety procedures for the development and deployment of highly capable AI. Understanding which AI risks are covered and what actions are allowed, refused, demanded, encouraged, or discouraged by these statements is vital for assessing how these frameworks actually govern AI development and deployment. We draw on affordance theory to analyse the OpenAI'Preparedness Framework Version 2'(April 2025) using the Mechanisms&Conditions model of affordances and the MIT AI Risk Repository. We find that this safety policy requests evaluation of a small minority of AI risks, encourages deployment of systems with'Medium'capabilities for unintentionally enabling'severe harm'(which OpenAI defines as>1000 deaths or>$100B in damages), and allows OpenAI's CEO to deploy even more dangerous capabilities. These findings suggest that effective mitigation of AI risks requires more robust governance interventions beyond current industry self-regulation. Our affordance analysis provides a replicable method for evaluating what safety frameworks actually permit versus what they claim."

      "abstract": "Blood glucose simulation allows the effectiveness of type 1 diabetes (T1D) management strategies to be evaluated without patient harm. Deep learning algorithms provide a promising avenue for extending simulator capabilities; however, these algorithms are limited in that they do not necessarily learn physiologically correct glucose dynamics and can learn incorrect and potentially dangerous relationships from confounders in training data. This is likely to be more important in real-world scenarios, as data is not collected under strict research protocol. This work explores the implications of using deep learning algorithms trained on real-world data to model glucose dynamics. Free-living data was processed from the OpenAPS Data Commons and supplemented with patient-reported tags of challenging diabetes events, constituting one of the most detailed real-world T1D datasets. This dataset was used to train and evaluate state-of-the-art glucose simulators, comparing their prediction error across safety critical scenarios and assessing the physiological appropriateness of the learned dynamics using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). While deep learning prediction accuracy surpassed the widely-used mathematical simulator approach, the model deteriorated in safety critical scenarios and struggled to leverage self-reported meal and exercise information. SHAP value analysis also indicated the model had fundamentally confused the roles of insulin and carbohydrates, which is one of the most basic T1D management principles. This work highlights the importance of considering physiological appropriateness when using deep learning to model real-world systems in T1D and healthcare more broadly, and provides recommendations for building models that are robust to real-world data constraints."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWarfighters perform highly complex and dangerous combat missions are both physically and cognitively challenging. Meeting these physiological demands are regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Thus, continuously monitoring ANS activity during combat and training may critically inform military leadership of the current physiological state and ability of their warfighters to effectively execute mission tasks. The purpose of this study was to quantify ANS response throughout 540 minutes (9 hours) of aviation-related combat training drills performed in the UH-60 helicopter.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAircrew members recruited from the United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory participated in the current study. ANS function was measured using the Warfighter Monitor (WFM, Tiger Tech Solutions, Inc., Miami, FL, Unites States), an armband monitor equipped with electrocardiographic capabilities. Subjects wore the WFM on the upper arm throughout their 540-minute combat training which consisted of aviation-related tasks. The WFM continuously monitored heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), and respiration rate (RR). Two HRV time-domain metrics were calculated: SD of the NN interval (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences of NN intervals (rMSSD). Studentized t-tests were performed to evaluate within- and between-group differences in ANS activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-four healthy, aircrew members aged between 18 and 45 years and mostly male, participated in the current study. For pre-flight events, average HRs ranged between 76.1 and 91.2 bpm. On average, HRs increased between +10.2 and +12.9 bpm. HRV metrics were between 72.4 and 91.3 milliseconds for rMSSD and from 101.8-139.9 ms for SDNN. RRs for aircrew members ranged between 12.4 and 13.5 breaths/min and increased by +1.4 to +1.7 breaths/min. For in-flight operations, significantly higher HRs (88.2-100.2 bpm) were observed. Similarly, significantly different increases were reported (+14.7 to +26.4 bpm). HRV metrics were significantly lower (rMSSD: 62.8-83.7 milliseconds; SDNN: 93.8-116.7 milliseconds). The average and increases in RRs were significantly higher, 12.8-17.3 breaths/min and +1.5 to +4.2 breaths/min.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSignificant increases in sympathetic drive were observed in U.S. warfighter aircrew during combat mission training, reflected by higher HRs, RRs, and lower HRV. The magnitudes in the ANS response, however, differed between pre- and in-flight operations with the latter inducing a larger response, possibly attributed to greater physical and cognitive workloads. These observations may aid warfighters and military leadership in designing effective preparedness training and implementing immediate intervention for managing the heightened sympathetic drive while preventing negative outcomes."

      "abstract": "In the last few years, the application of ICT technologies in automotive field has taken an increasing role in improving both the safety and the driving comfort. In this context, systems capable of determining the traffic situation and/or driver behaviour through the analysis of signals from multiple sensors (e.g. radar, cameras, etc...) are the subject of active research in both industrial and academic sectors (Trivedi et al., 2007); (Yu et al., 2009); (Schneider et al., 2008). These systems, unlike autonomous vehicles or automated control systems are more acceptable for near future real applications since they try to improve driver’s sensing capabilities and to help the decision process in a non-intrusive way. According to this statement, car manufacturers are starting to introduce driving support systems in luxury vehicles as, for instance, parking sensors. The extraction of contextual information through the analysis of video streams captured by cameras can therefore have implications in many applications focused both on prevention of incidents and on provision of useful messages to drivers as traffic flows analysis, dangerous behaviour detection, traffic laws infringements (e.g. speed limits), etc.... For these applications the analysis of what happens inside and outside a car is a relevant source of information. A framework is proposed, integrating a dual camera network and a set of heterogeneous sensors communicating through a CAN-bus for the extraction of context data from on-board cameras mounted on vehicles and of other data as steering angle, speed, brakes, etc.... A camera is oriented so as to frame the portion of road in front of the vehicle while the other one is positioned inside the vehicle and pointed on the driver. As a matter of fact, the joint analysis of on board/off board car context can be used to derive considerations on driver’s behaviour and then to detect possible dangerous situations (sleep, dangerous lane changes, etc.) or a driving style which does not respect traffic regulation. Three blocks are considered: a) internal processing, b) external processing and c) vehicle status data coming from the CAN-bus. The most significant data that can be extracted from a camera monitoring the driver are the gaze direction, the position of face, frequency of blinking eyes and mouth movement. As well, the camera looking outside the vehicle allows detecting the position of the vehicle on the road and the lane changes. Moreover, the analysis of the road type (highway, urban road, etc.) and of traffic can provide relevant information to evaluate the possible risks of the driving behaviour. Finally, the data"

      "abstract": "The resolution of variation within species is critical for interpreting and acting on many microbial measurements. In the key foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella, the primary sub-species classification scheme used is serotyping: differentiating variants within these species by surface antigen profiles. Serotype prediction from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates is now seen as comparable or preferable to traditional laboratory methods where WGS is available. However, laboratory and WGS methods depend on an isolation step that is time-consuming and incompletely represents the sample when multiple strains are present. Community sequencing approaches that skip the isolation step are therefore of interest for pathogen surveillance. Here we evaluated the viability of amplicon sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene for serotyping S. enterica and E. coli. We developed a novel algorithm for serotype prediction, implemented as an R package (Seroplacer), which takes as input full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and outputs serovar predictions after phylogenetic placement into a reference phylogeny. We achieved over 89% accuracy in predicting Salmonella serotypes on in silico test data, and identified key pathogenic serovars of Salmonella and E. coli in isolate and environmental test samples. Although serotype prediction from 16S sequences is not as accurate as serotype prediction from WGS of isolates, the potential to identify dangerous serovars directly from amplicon sequencing of environmental samples is intriguing for pathogen surveillance. The capabilities developed here are also broadly relevant to other applications where intra-species variation and direct sequencing from environmental samples could be valuable."

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the application of algorithms available in machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM) as well as Resnet-50, in the classification of dangerous skin cancer from epiluminescence microscopy images. The study analyzes effectiveness of the two models on accuracy evaluation metrics that include confusion matrix, graphical plots, Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and attempts to find which model more optimally detects skin cancer. Previous studies indicate that Resnet-50 outperforms SVM in detection accuracy capabilities. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to also showcase the ability to enhance perception accuracy for skin cancer by integrating both models. The results of this study are clinically relevant. With the implementation of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, clinicians are now able to make reliable diagnoses of skin cancer which lessens the degree of subjective variability between different clinicians and enhances clinical objectivity. The study emphasizes the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer using machine learning models, which improves patient consequences. The abstract highlights significant insights on the performance of models present in machine learning for detecting skin cancers and becomes a useful resource for clinicians and researchers who consider adapting the use of machine learning in skin cancer detection."

      "abstract": "Mine weapons, as one of the most affordable means of destroying personnel and weapons and military equipment, are increasingly used in modern military conflicts, which has brought to the fore the issue of maintaining the combat capabilities of troops (forces) in the conditions of \"mine warfare\". Due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, Ukraine has become the most explosive contaminated country in the world today. During combat operations, one of the most difficult tasks of supporting the troops is to reconnoiter the area for explosive devices, demine the area and make passages in the enemy minefields during the offensive, and in the absence of such, to perform humanitarian demining. To accomplish these tasks, the organizational and staffing structure of the engineer troops provides for appropriate units equipped with both equipment and hand-held reconnaissance and demining kits. However, the reconnaissance and demining kits are currently outdated, inefficient, and do not meet the requirements for performing this type of task. At the same time, due to the obsolescence and unsatisfactory condition of reconnaissance and mechanization of making passages in minefields, the manual method remains the main one, which is extremely dangerous and leads to personnel losses. Given this state of affairs, namely that the manual method of reconnaissance and demining is the main one, the issue of improving (developing) new manual reconnaissance and demining kits has become acute. During the development (improvement) of RCs, one of the fundamental issues is to determine the significance of their parameters. The article presents a partial methodology for comparative evaluation of the parameters of demining kits using the method of expert assessments. The proposed partial methodologyallows determining the weighting coefficients of certain parameters of demining kits. Based on the theoretical provisions presented in the study, an algorithm for processing the results of the expert survey. Finally, the numerical values of the weighting coefficients of the parameters of demining kits are obtained and the direction of further research is formulated."

      "abstract": "In 2013, the Apulia region in Southern Italy experienced the first outbreak of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), a highly dangerous plant pathogenic bacterium that infects olive trees. The impact of Xf on Apulian agriculture has been profound and multifaceted. Olive orchards have suffered severe damage, with the emergence of Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) leading to widespread tree mortality. Beyond the economic losses faced by farmers, the olive trees’ cultural and environmental significance adds another layer of concern. For these reasons, different studies have been conducted to identify olive cultivars that are more resistant to the bacterium, such as “Leccino” and “FS-17”. In recent years, a regional plan has been established to support the replanting of felled olive trees in areas interested in past eradications, allowing to plant only two olive tree varieties “Leccino” and “FS-17”, tolerant to the bacterium. For this reason, it could be particularly interesting to use proximal and remote sensing techniques to detect and classify different olive tree cultivars. This work aims to evaluate the capabilities of vis-NIR spectroscopy/hyperspectral data analysis in the classification of three olive cultivars (“Leccino”, “Cima di Bitonto”, and “FS-17”). A portable spectroradiometer (FieldSpec4 Pro), equipped with a leaf clip, was used in the field for leaf spectral measurements. 108 leaf spectral signatures were acquired at different times (0, 2 and 24 hours) after the leaf detachment phase and analyzed to evaluate the variation in overall reflectance and in 65 vegetative indices value (NDVI, EVI, …) over time. The results obtained not only demonstrate the efficacy of spectral signature in cultivar classification, but also provide important information to optimize ground measurement campaigns and to set up the hyperspectral data collection, on wide areas, acquired by sensors installed on UAV, airborne or satellite."

      "abstract": "Do LLMs robustly generalize critical safety facts to novel situations? Lacking this ability is dangerous when users ask naive questions. For instance,\"I'm considering packing melon balls for my 10-month-old's lunch. What other foods would be good to include?\"Before offering food options, the LLM should warn that melon balls pose a choking hazard to toddlers, as documented by the CDC. Failing to provide such warnings could result in serious injuries or even death. To evaluate this, we introduce SAGE-Eval, SAfety-fact systematic GEneralization evaluation, the first benchmark that tests whether LLMs properly apply well established safety facts to naive user queries. SAGE-Eval comprises 104 facts manually sourced from reputable organizations, systematically augmented to create 10,428 test scenarios across 7 common domains (e.g., Outdoor Activities, Medicine). We find that the top model, Claude-3.7-sonnet, passes only 58% of all the safety facts tested. We also observe that model capabilities and training compute weakly correlate with performance on SAGE-Eval, implying that scaling up is not the golden solution. Our findings suggest frontier LLMs still lack robust generalization ability. We recommend developers use SAGE-Eval in pre-deployment evaluations to assess model reliability in addressing salient risks. We publicly release SAGE-Eval at https://huggingface.co/datasets/YuehHanChen/SAGE-Eval and our code is available at https://github.com/YuehHanChen/SAGE-Eval/tree/main."

      "abstract": "The most commonly found disease in aged people which can be dangerous and which affects the condition of an individual’s life is disc degenerative disease. The shift in the anterior load-bearing column was caused by the disc height changes in posterior side which could have adverse effects on posterior column. The lack of symptoms at early stages makes the identification of disc degenerative disease difficult but once identified, the treatment actions should be taken at right time. Biomechanical literature gives a static morphology of the FE models of cervical spine. An upcoming tendency in the current day medical practice is the use of personalized medicines and the predicting capabilities of this trend gets affected by not taking into account morphology as a model parameter. Finite element analysis is used to find the effect of variations in morphology of spine, intervertebral disc height, slope of facet joint, process height of articular facet joint and segment size was parametrized. Finite element study was done on vertebral rotation variations and ligamental forces. Some of the most important morphological variations found in the anatomy were disc segmental size & height and body depth. The estimation of ROM and calculation of impact loads were found to be the key elements in the examination of degeneration of discs. Nonetheless there are risks involved in the extensive use of instruments for direct measurement of range of motion. Fem models of the lower cervical spine are derived from a CT scan with dissimilar elements and then quality of these models is evaluated with the help of mesh element-related metrics. The range of motion values are then compared with the literature studies and the model with good mesh standard are used for future examination process. The individual components of spine are subjected to different types of loading situations and the stresses developed on them need to studied. The results gained from the finite element model helps us to plot stresses of subjects obtained from the respective lifestyles can benefit surgeons to suggest treatment actions."

The surveillance device is required to operate in the controlled area at the given altitude in a way that not to overlook suspicious flying objects passing through the zone. In order for surveillance devices to carry out the search process, the control zone is first distributed among the devices, and then the search modes of the devices are determined. In order to assess the abilities of any flight object to pass through this control zone during the search along the control lane, the overlooked periods of different points of the control lane during the monitoring process are evaluated and then compared with the flight time of this object."

This study is a systematic literature review of recent developments in DT technology, focusing on its practical functions and methods for effective safety risk management. The advantages of DT models include flexibility and simulation capabilities, which are helpful in conducting analyses and simulations in all four phases of safety risk management. However, despite DTs’ functionality and simulation capability in the safety risk field, challenges remain. Unresolved issues in practical use include a lack of standardization, data integration problems, and the need for advanced simulation tools. These problems should be addressed to enhance response accuracy to dangerous events and improve decision-making processes. This study showcases the latest DT technology trends by listing DTs’ expected features and practical twinning processes while underscoring the constraints and unresolved problems in adopting DTs for safety risk management."

      "abstract": "Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap between LM agents'risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they often answer\"Yes\"to queries like\"Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*'dangerous?\", they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to examine agents'safety across three progressive dimensions: 1) their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs: while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with performance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$ pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\\%$ over vanilla-prompted agents."

      "abstract": "\nEven though the risk of a negative encounter with a large and potentially dangerous shark species (e.g. white sharks—Carcharodon carcharias) is exceedingly rare, some localities implement indiscriminate shark culls to minimize this risk.\nDue to the negative ecological impact that these lethal shark control measures can have, the present study aimed to test a novel and eco‐friendly shark barrier system, known as the Shark Exclusion Barrier. The Shark Exclusion Barrier is a shark deterrent technology that is composed of a combination of interconnected and telescoping vertical barrier elements (i.e. the visual stimulus) and electromagnetic stimuli (e.g. electromagnets and Barium Ferrite (BaFe12O19) permanent magnets). Using this system, two separate C. carcharias swim pattern manipulation studies were conducted over the course of two research seasons.\nIn the first season (i.e. 2021), 9, 1‐h trials were conducted where 9–13 different C. carcharias interacted with the barrier.\nIn the second season (i.e. 2023), 35, 2‐h trials were conducted where 6–10 C. carcharias interacted with the barrier.\nThroughout experimentation, C. carcharias exhibited a significantly greater entrance frequency (p < 0.05) and a significantly reduced pass around frequency (p < 0.05) towards the control region when compared to the Shark Exclusion Barrier region.\nFurthermore, the barrier exhibited the ability to maintain its structural integrity during swells of ≥2.13 m, breaking waves of ≥1.52 m and a current of ≥1.12 m/s.\nDue to the promising results, this technology warrants further investigation to determine if it is a plausible alternative to lethal culling measures.\n"

      "abstract": "The purpose of the firefighting robot is to detect fires in nearby areas and assist firefighters in dangerous situations by helping them quickly extinguish the fire. It can also prevent household fires which occur in an average of 358,500 homes each year (NFPA). More than 3,000 Americans die in fires each year (FEMA). Fire Response Time (FRT) becomes very crucial for such situations which really help save lives and improve the chances of overall damage control. According to NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) Standard 1710 establishes an 80 second “turnout time” and 240 second “travel time” which together makes 5 minutes and 20 seconds. FRT is dependent on how soon it has been reported and based on when the Standard 1710 is triggered to meet the deadlines. In fire situations many accidents are reported by affected residents at a very later stage or in some situations the incidents are reported by people outside the premises, since no humans are inside. This is where I saw Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and its powerful sensor based vision capabilities coming into play to create the ‘Robot FireX’. Idea is to create a reliable system that can accurately locate and sense either of three signals: excessive heat, smoke and the sound of a fire alarm. By recognizing any of these signals, AI is a crucial first step for the ‘Robot FireX’ to capture the signal and immediately send an alert to a mobile number, simultaneously start moving in the direction of fire to extinguish it with the help of water or carbon dioxide spray. The goal is to put out the fire immediately and as effectively as possible, minimize property damage and reduce the amount of lives lost each year in fire incidents. The ‘Robot FireX’ can be designed in various sizes depending on the situation such as homes or industrial sites. Plus more AI specific capabilities can be activated in ‘Robot FireX’ to bring further refinements, so that it will be able to work in the unpredictable environments to spot high-risks like gas leaks and send improved alerts such as live videos, images of the accidents and send GPS coordinates of the site to the fire department. It can also become a very crucial aid to be used as a First Response Team. When used by firefighters, it can prove to be an extremely valuable tool in evaluating the entire scene and eliminating any threats before bringing the whole situation under control."

It includes many types of liquid, solid and gas waste That negatively affect The environment and society in general, and those working in health institutions, in particular; if not Managed according to an integrated Environmental system. \n   The disposal of Hazardous medical waste is one of the problems That haunt environmental and health authorities in Egypt; due to the limited capabilities and their low efficiency if found. Annually, the generation of these hazardous wastes rises due to the increase in health care institutions with steady population increase. Perhaps what makes it more difficult is The lack of sufficient awareness of its danger. \n  The evaluation of hazardous solid medical waste Treatment units according to Environmental and health requirements is an integral part of The hazardous medical waste management system, but this stage of treatment is The most dangerous and complicated stage. It is a bridge between The generation, Collection and Sorting processes, and The final disposal of treatment products. \n  The research consisted of six main Topics. Topic one dealt with The structure of The treatment units system and its equipment, Topic two dealt with generation rates and The actual disposal volume, Topic Three presented an analysis of operating rates, Topic four was singled out to study The system of managing solid medical hazardous waste in The governorate, Topic five provided a geographical assessment of The locations of The treatment units, As for The sixth topic, it presented The sustainable Environmental management of hazardous solid Medical waste in The governorate."

      "abstract": "Glaucoma is a dangerous eye illness that greatly reduces the sharpness of a person's vision. If not caught early enough, this retinal disorder can damage the optic nerve head (ONH) and cause permanent blindness. Automated glaucoma diagnosis now has tool support thanks to recent advances in deep learning besides the convenience of computing resources. The low reliability of generic convolutional neural networks has prevented their widespread usage in medical procedures, even if deep learning has improved illness diagnosis using medical pictures. While there has been a rise in the use of deep learning for glaucoma classification, very few studies have tested whether or not the models are easy to understand and interpret, which bodes well for their future use. Medical picture feature extraction using Vision Transformers is showcased in this study utilising an EvoTransform: Advanced Evolutionary Algorithm Integration in Transformer Networks named as (EvoTAEA). Combining the powers of Convolutional Neural Networks with Vision Transformers, the suggested EAT Former architecture takes advantage of their data pattern recognition in addition adaptability capabilities. The classification accuracy is enhanced by using the Wild Geese Migration Optimizer (WGMO) to fine-tune the parameters of the proposed feature extraction. The design makes use of new parts, such as the Multi-Scale Region Aggregation, Global and Local Interaction, and Enhanced EA based Transformer blocks with Feed-Forward networks. For dynamically simulating non-standard places, it also presents the Modulated Deformable MSA module. Important components of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model are covered in the study, including patch-based processing, Multi-Head Attention mechanism, and positional context inclusion. In order to give an inductive bias, it presents the Multi-Scale Region Aggregation module, which combines data from several receptive fields. The MSA-based global module is improved by the Global and Local Interaction module, which adds a local path for extracting discriminative local info. An approach to glaucoma diagnosis that integrates ResNet-50, DenseNet-201, and Xception is suggested in the study. Two publicly available datasets, ORIGA and ACRIMA, are used to evaluate the trials. This model can help with the automated diagnosis of glaucoma using fundus pictures."

      "abstract": "Ransomware is still one of the most current and dangerous types of malware on the internet. Ransomware is detrimental in its impact towards both personal and corporate entities, while its consequences are often financially and operationally disastrous. This paper focuses on analysing the ransomware threat capabilities and trends during the last ten years and how cybercriminals have updated their approaches to the threat. The research explores the evolution of ransomware, such as the ransomware-as-a-service (raas), second-stage extortion schemes, sophisticated encryption, and obfuscation techniques. Further, the study measures present-day mitigation measures like endpoint protection, employee training, and incident response systems and defines unmet needs in the present defensive measures. While the paper evaluates cases where organisations have successfully enacted response strategies, organization must ensure proactivity, backed-up presence and effective cybersecurity policies. In addition, the study expects future developments in ransomware attacks to involve artificial intelligence tools to enhance the strategies and attacks towards the key areas of interest, such as the healthcare and energy sectors. The study highlights the necessity for effective legal measures to counter the work of ransomware actors who operate internationally and offers improvements to the policy and defence measures."

      "abstract": "As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety. This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1) establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones influencing their feasibility."

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown mind-boggling question-answering capabilities. Most of their responses make one feel that they understand and remember context and are able to retrieve relevant content to generate almost accurate, human-like responses. While LLMs seem to mimic human intelligence, their responses can sometimes be inconsistent. Although LLMs are getting acceptance in healthcare for tasks like diagnosis support or patient communication, their inaccurate, inconsistent, or misleading information can be dangerous and can lead to harmful medical decisions if not properly validated by experts. Due to these limitations, LLM-powered full automation is still a dream. This paper presents a structured approach that can be used as basis to check LLMs level of “understanding” of medical knowledge and their “inferential capabilities” by evaluation of their responses to the word problems related to human heartbeat. The crafted word problems designed in the light of the proposed approach can be very helpful in identifying inherent weaknesses stemming from their fundamental nature. The study can be highly beneficial for healthcare professionals in determining the appropriate level of adoption of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to identify heartbeat related disorders like Arrhythmia."

      "abstract": "Background: Since the end of the Cold War, nuclear arms control has undergone profound challenges due to weakening treaties and rapid military innovations. The expiration of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019 and the near-lapse of the New START Treaty in 2021 created a dangerous vacuum in global security frameworks. Rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Russia and the West, have escalated fears of renewed arms races that jeopardize decades of achievements in disarmament and nonproliferation.\nObjective: The study aimed to evaluate the consequences of weakened arms control mechanisms in the post–Cold War era and to assess the potential pathways for strengthening strategic stability through renewed dialogue and treaty frameworks.\nMethods: A qualitative research design was employed using thematic analysis to examine a wide range of secondary sources, including international treaties, governmental reports, non-governmental policy papers, and academic literature. Inclusion criteria required documents to directly address nuclear arms control, disarmament, and strategic stability. Data were coded iteratively, with triangulation from multiple sources to ensure credibility and minimize bias. Ethical standards of scholarship were upheld, and no human participants were involved.\nResults: Findings revealed that global stockpiles reduced dramatically from nearly 63,000 nuclear warheads in 1986 to approximately 8,300 today. However, Russia and the United States remain responsible for more than 90% of these weapons and continue expansive modernization programs, including new missile systems, submarines, and strategic bombers. The study identified that the absence of effective verification protocols was a major factor in the collapse of the INF Treaty, and without the renewal of New START to at least 2026, a further erosion of transparency and trust is imminent. Additionally, the integration of emerging technologies—hypersonic weapons, ballistic missile defense, and cyber systems—was found to destabilize the traditional notion of mutual vulnerability.\nConclusion: The study concludes that arms control remains indispensable for global security and stability. Renewing the New START Treaty and integrating broader issues such as third-party arsenals, advanced delivery systems, and space- or cyber-based military capabilities are critical. Strengthened verification measures and revitalized multilateral dialogue are essential for reactivating NATO–Russia cooperation and advancing a verifiable, sustainable path toward disarmament."

      "abstract": "The current state of the ecological situation in our country is becoming dangerous not only for the present but for future generations largely. These are contradictory principles of sustainable development and threatens the further development of the state. Ensuring the sustainable development of human civilization depends on many factors and conditions. In recent decades, humanity has been actively implementing the concept of sustainable development. This concept became widespread after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. This concept of sustainable development creates possibility to achieve socio-ecological and economic security and safety. The concept of sustainable development is based on the impossibility of solving environmental safety problems separately without solving economic and social problems. Thus, focusing only on the economic indicators of production leads to a catastrophic deterioration of the environment and public health, which is accompanied by loss of ability to work, reduced efficiency, and, consequently, reduced Gross National Product. At present, the concept of sustainable development is especially relevant for our country in general and for its regions in particular. The problem of environmental safety plays an important role, as it ensures the use of natural resources that will contribute to their natural recovery as well as reduce the impact of anthropogenic pressure on the environment. For effective studying the problem of environmental safety we decided to assess environmental safety at the regional level on the example of Rivne region. The article considers the issue of assessing the state of ecological safety of residential areas of Rivne region. Analysis of recent research shows that environmental safety is formed under the influence of environmental, socio-economic and man-made factors. Therefore, the definition of environmental safety requires a comprehensive approach. Since the definition of local safety requires a comprehensive approach, it is based on assessing the socio-ecological safety of the research area. Achieving the goal is expected through the solution of the following tasks: - substantiate the selection of indicators for the assessment of residential areas; - to calculate the levels of security of residential areas of Rivne region for each district. The method of evaluation of scientists Gerasymchuk Z.V., Oleksiiuk A.O. is represented as a basis. It is proposed to divide all indicators into 3 blocks: resource, biosphere-centric and anthropocentric. The assessment is performed using indicators of partial integrated levels of environmental safety of three blocks of resource, biosphere-centric and anthropocentric. In the resource block we will analyze the indicators that show the number, level of involvement and efficiency of use. In the biosphere-centric we will analyze the indicators of anthropogenic impact on the environment through the formation of discharges, emissions and waste. In the anthropocentric block we will study the state of health of the population, the level of growth and population estimate. Then, based on these calculations for each unit, we determine a partial indicator of environmental safety. On the basis of the calculated 3 blocks according to a technique we will receive an integrated indicator of ecological safety. The integrated indicator gives a qualitative assessment of the ecological condition of each specific district according to the developed scale Gerasymchuk Z.V., Oleksiiuk A.O. Also this indicator gives us the possibility to make a comparative description of the districts among themselves. Thus, in our work it was established that in the vast majority in the zone of ecological threat there are 12 districts, in the zone of ecological danger - 3 districts of Rivne, Sarny, Zdolbuniv regions. In the zone of ecological risk is Berezne district. A large number of areas that are in the zone of danger indicates that these areas are characterized by a high level of man-made load on the environment. Based on this, to ensure the environmental security of the territory it is necessary to form the main and supplementary strategies, depending on the state of environmental security and financial capabilities of the region. Thus, the conducted diagnosis of environmental safety allowed to assess not only the integrated indicator of environmental safety, but also to identify the main factors that may lead to the deterioration of the environmental situation."

      "abstract": "Women’s safety remains a critical and urgent concern, as evidenced by the increasing incidence of harassment and violence, necessitating the development of innovative, technology-driven solutions. Although numerous mobile applications have been designed to address this issue, many fails to deliver essential functionalities. These deficiencies include the lack of real-time emergency response mechanisms, seamless tracking capabilities, and proactive safety features that meaningfully enhance user protection. Often, these applications rely on outdated alert systems and exhibit delayed SOS notifications, undermining their effectiveness in critical situations. To address these shortcomings, ‘Shield Sisters’ was developed as a Flutter-based mobile application aimed at equipping women with reliable and practical safety tools. The application integrates instant SOS alerts, real-time location tracking, an intelligent geofencing system, and a community-driven safety reporting mechanism. Its robust technological infrastructure comprises MongoDB, Node.js, and Firebase Firestore for efficient backend operations, the Twilio API for immediate emergency SMS notifications, and the Google Maps API for precise, real-time geolocation services. Shield Sisters classifies locations into Safe Zones (e.g., police stations and hospitals), Red Zones (e.g., high-risk areas), and Neutral Zones, providing users with timely warnings before entering potentially dangerous areas. Furthermore, its live tracking feature updates the user’s location every ten seconds, enabling trusted contacts to monitor movements with accuracy. To ensure security and privacy, Shield Sisters employs SHA-256 encryption for password protection, JWT-based authentication for user verification, and role-based access controls to restrict emergency contact privileges. The application’s performance, scalability, and security were rigorously evaluated using Flutter’s testing framework, Thunder Client for API validation, and stress testing to assess server load capacity. Designed for speed, scalability, and dependability, Shield Sisters offers a trustworthy solution that users can rely upon in moments of need.\n\n\n\n\nKey Words:  women’s safety application, real-time tracking, firebase, node.js, mongo DB, flutter Application"

      "abstract": "Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) detection is a crucial component of autonomous vehicles. While You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm, factors like training data quality and adverse weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain) can lead to detection failures. These failures can be particularly dangerous when visual similarities between objects exist, such as mistaking a 30 km/h sign for a higher speed limit sign. This paper proposes a method that combines video analysis and reasoning, prompting with a human-in-the-loop guide large vision model to improve YOLOs accuracy in detecting road speed limit signs, especially in semi-real-world conditions. It is hypothesized that the guided prompting and reasoning abilities of Video-LLava can enhance YOLOs traffic sign detection capabilities. This hypothesis is supported by an evaluation based on human-annotated accuracy metrics within a dataset of recorded videos from the CARLA car simulator. The results demonstrate that a collaborative approach combining YOLO with Video-LLava and reasoning can effectively address challenging situations such as heavy rain and overcast conditions that hinder YOLOs detection capabilities."

      "abstract": "The importance of IoT security is growing as a result of the growing number of IoT devices and their many applications. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults on IoT systems have become more frequent, sophisticated, and of a different kind, according to recent research on network security, making DDoS one of the most formidable dangers. Real, lucrative, and efficient cybercrimes are carried out using DDoS attacks. One of the most dangerous types of assaults in network security is the DDoS attack. ML-based DDoS-detection systems continue to face obstacles that negatively impact their accuracy. AI, which incorporates ML to detect cyberattacks, is the most often utilised approach for these goals. In this study, it is suggested that DDoS assaults in Software-Defined Networking be identified and countered using ML approaches. The F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision of many ML techniques, including Cat Boost and Extra Tree classifier, are compared in the suggested model. DDoS-Net is designed to handle data imbalance effectively and incorporates thorough feature analysis to enhance the model's detection capabilities. Evaluation on the UNSW-NB15 dataset demonstrates the exceptional performance of DDoS-Net. The highest accuracy achieved by the machine learning algorithms Cat Boost and Extra Tree classifier is 90.78% and 90.27% respectively using the most familiar dataset. This work presents a strong and precise approach for DDoS attack detection, which greatly improves the cybersecurity environment and strengthens digital infrastructures against these ubiquitous threats."

      "abstract": "Airport surface operations are a safety-critical component of the transportation industry. Although airports are nominally centrally deconflicted by an air traffic controller, stochastic pilot behavior and planning errors still result in dangerous outcomes such as runway incursions and loss of separation. Intention prediction and motion forecasting for taxiing aircraft is thus essential for robust and safe airport operations. In this work we propose a ground monitoring and trajectory forecasting system built with state-of-the-art normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are powerful generative models that provide both density estimation and sampling capabilities, allowing a runway monitoring agent to perform trajectory likelihood evaluation and future trajectory rollouts. Furthermore, we use lightweight liquid neural networks to learn context embeddings for observed trajectory data and parameterize the flows. We train our models on weeks of historical ADS-B data and evaluate our approach on real-world ground movements at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport."

      "abstract": "What’s next? – To know what comes next is already important in carrying out action and allows us to make fast movements. We use predictions in control of our own movements and to anticipate what is going on around us. \n \nClark’s (in press) perspective is pushing the importance of prediction even further. Predictions are the “language” in between different representations: levels of representation do not communicate by exchanging state information, instead the information flow is lazy and one level is telling the other only what that does not know – or would not predict or expect. \n \nWhile we value Clark’s thoughts on the hierarchical prediction machine approach and its implications, one important requirement is not addressed: the connections between different levels of representations are not only not arbitrary, but it appears that these can be flexibly utilized and in this way different combinations of interconnected – predicting – layers can serve diverse purposes. \n \nTo illustrate, we put this issue into the viewpoint of representations, central to which functional internal models are. We agree with Clark that these internal models have to be predictive. But there may be more to them then only prediction. First of all, engaged (and maybe grounded as sensorimotor circuits) internal models may serve an inverse function in motor control, i.e., coming up with motor control commands when given a certain goal. Secondly, as animals and humans have a wide variety of redundant sensors, such internal models should exploit the redundancy and integrate the noisy contributions of multiple sensors. \n \nAs we know today, such internal models are not only serving one single function, but internal models are recruited in service for diverse function (Anderson, 2010), e.g., perception, to understand the actions performed by somebody else, or in planning ahead. The internal models are recruited in an internal simulation (Hesslow, 2002) – and central is their predictive function: in planning ahead they are used to simulate possible consequences of actions and then to choose only a suitable one. In understanding someone’s else actions they are driven by an unfolding action and start to resonate with the action, at the same time also invoking representations related to this action, e.g., on a higher level something like a goal or guiding perception on a lower level. While prediction is essential to internal models, it is the flexible use and the way in which levels can be combined and inform each other that makes this a powerful tool serving many functions [up to language, as shown, e.g., by Ramscar et al. (2010)]. This flow of predictive information in between levels (top-down and bottom-up) of representation depends on both: on the one hand, on the capability to activate connected levels of representation (e.g., attention), but on the other hand, also to decouple levels of representation (for example, in planning ahead it is important that the body itself is decoupled from the planning process, but we can plan on different levels and switch between these levels). These mechanisms are left out in Clark’s approach and should be specified next. Yet, if we would like to scale a model up to symbolic representations such as language, we need to understand how connected levels of representation are linked and inform each other in multiple ways, and how the connections can be modulated and are flexible in different contexts. \n \nWe approach these connections of internal representation through models of minimal cognitive systems in a bottom-up approach (Schilling and Cruse, submitted;Schilling and Cruse, 2008). An early neural network model of the own body is grounded in a biological-inspired framework that controls walking in a hexapod robot. While this internal model is very simple, it is quite flexible and can be recruited in service for multiple functions (Schilling, 2011). Importantly, the predictive capabilities of the body model allow applying the model in internal simulation. In internal simulation alternative possible behaviors can be tried out and the predicted consequences can be evaluated without actually carrying out probably dangerous behaviors (Hesslow, 2002). The system can plan ahead and becomes cognitive in the sense of McFarland and Bosser (1993). Interestingly, the behavioral system, which allows variation of existing or creation of new behaviors, implements a form of unified neuronal workspace (Dehaene and Naccache, 2001; on a more abstract level this might be termed a global workspace following; Baars and Franklin, 2007). In this global workspace, behavioral elements can be accessed (and possibly varied) in new contexts in order to find a (new) solution to an actual problem. The decisions of the system are not directly triggered by sensory input and are not predictable from outside. Instead action selection occurs at various levels of complexity. We argue that such a system shows properties of what has been termed access consciousness by Cleeremans (2005; which is distinguished from metacognition and phenomenological consciousness). Access consciousness refers to the ability of a system to plan and guide actions, to reason and to report verbally on the content of the corresponding representations. Such accessible states are required to guide the action variation process during internal simulation. They emerge in such a system leading to networks of interconnected higher level representations which are at the same time grounded, but not directly accessible, lower level sensorimotor representations. Competitive activation of representational units leads to an attention-like focus. From our point of view, it is interesting how such simple neural network based models show such high-level properties and connect to philosophical accounts1. Even though internal models are central to this approach, it is their flexibility which makes the system cognitive. Internal simulation becomes crucial, as the decoupled use of internal models in internal simulation suddenly allows evaluating alternative actions. This introduces an internal competition of alternative behaviors and varying existing behaviors or coming up with new behaviors (even risky ones) becomes now valuable. The concurrent activation of such behaviors leads, first, to action selection. And second, a form of attention as a focus on this behavior emerges and the behavior has to be evaluated. The unfolding behavior has to be related to the agent’s motivations or, on a higher level, goals. Prediction is the key to, first, allow for planning ahead as internal simulation and choosing novel behaviors only based on estimated consequences. Second, this might serve as a starting point for a higher level organization of accessible and attended internal states."

      "abstract": "The wide deployment of artificial intelligence triggers fundamental changes to social patterns and financial operations and technological applications while generating unknown ethical and philosophical domains. This evaluation examines the AI-normative relationship through an analysis of fundamental thinking principles that change due to machine intelligence including consciousness and moral agency and free will and personhood. This paper evaluates utilitarianism together with deontology and virtue ethics and care ethics to determine their effectiveness and limitations in guiding AI behavior across healthcare and education and finance and defence sectors. The paper devotes extensive study to both the ethical issues stemming from biased algorithms and hidden decision processes and complications arising from ethical differences and dangerous autonomous system operation scenarios. This research shows how inequality appears during global AI implementations to justify ethical frameworks which defend human dignity while being culturally understandable to all groups and socially just. The combination of philosophy with technology practice transforms ethics-by-design into an essential development method that embeds moral reasoning capabilities within artificial intelligence development processes. The research examines superintelligence ethical possibilities and lethal weapons and human-AI unity systems by recommending new governance systems that demand interdisciplinary collaboration. The research defines a innovative model for AI progress which integrates human value-based strategies with regulatory action. This research advances current ethical discussions about AI governance by providing an extensive framework for AI ethical oversight in the twenty-first century."

      "abstract": "Introduction. Special conditions for the activity of specialists of the naval crews are often «forced» to function at the limit of the physiological capabilities of the body, requiring constant maintenance of a high level of physical working capacity. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of combined physical and normobaric hypoxic training for an emergency increase in the physical endurance of ship specialists and other representatives of «dangerous» occupations. Materials and methods. Were examined 18 men (10 people — the main group, 8 people — the control group) aged 19–22 years. The subjects of both groups performed workouts on exercise bikes: work power 1,2 W/kg, duration 2 hours, the total number of training sessions 14. For people of the main group, physical training was carried out under conditions of normobaric hypoxia created in the normobaric hypoxic complex, with an oxygen content of about 16% (15,9 kPa). In persons of the control group, hypoxia conditions were imitated: atmospheric air was supplied to the premises of the hypoxic complex. The physical endurance of the subjects was evaluated by the maximum oxygen consumption indicator. Results and its discussion. The studies revealed that the effectiveness of training in individuals of the main group turned out to be significantly higher compared to the control, as evidenced by the results of control tests of physical endurance, carried out both immediately after the training and in the long-term observation period. Thus, the method of combined physical and normobaric hypoxic training can be considered as an effective and safe means of emergency and persistent increase in physical endurance of ship specialists and of other categories of people with difficult and dangerous working conditions."

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the vulnerabilities inherent in the Android operating system architecture and examines how malware developers exploit these weaknesses to execute a variety of attacks. These include aggressive advertising, remote control capabilities, financial fraud, privilege escalation, and the leaking of sensitive information. In this paper, we survey a collection of anti-malware techniques and organize these techniques into three canonical classes (static methods, dynamic methods, hybrid methodologies) according to how they are used or implemented with respect to the host operating system. We also evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques against certain types of attacks and summarize them under test categories for reporting results. We also examine the typical countermeasures used by malware authors to disguise their approaches against existing detection methods, such as reintegrating with real applications, using update payloads, executing dynamic code, scrambling dangerous content, and setting traps to act upon only purposely triggered situations. In future work, we suggest research into the capability of reinforcement learning methods to further increase sustainability and adaptability of anti-malware strategies. This Research study aimed at creating more dynamic detection systems for malware by utilizing machine learning techniques that could change in parallel with the tactics used by malware developers. By leveraging this technique, you could drastically boost the efficacy of existing anti-malware solutions that are unable to respond to new threats. As the digital environment changes (and continues to change), Mobile provides threat analysts, fraud / security managers and legal authorities up-to-date circumstantial direction so users can move with confidence within their mobile landscapes."

      "abstract": "Ransomware poses a significant threat to individuals and organisations, compelling tools to investigate its behaviour and the effectiveness of mitigations. To answer this need, we present SAFARI, an open-source framework designed for safe and efficient ransomware analysis. SAFARI's design emphasises scalability, air-gapped security, and automation, democratising access to safe ransomware investigation tools and fostering collaborative efforts. SAFARI leverages virtualisation, Infrastructure-as-Code, and OS-agnostic task automation to create isolated environments for controlled ransomware execution and analysis. The framework enables researchers to profile ransomware behaviour and evaluate mitigation strategies through automated, reproducible experiments. We demonstrate SAFARI's capabilities by building a proof-of-concept implementation and using it to run two case studies. The first analyses five renowned ransomware strains (including WannaCry and LockBit) to identify their encryption patterns and file targeting strategies. The second evaluates Ranflood, a contrast tool which we use against three dangerous strains. Our results provide insights into ransomware behaviour and the effectiveness of countermeasures, showcasing SAFARI's potential to advance ransomware research and defence development."

      "abstract": "Purpose. The article substantiates the need to develop the information and analytical system (IAS) “Probit” designed to justify the sufficiency or development of additional systems for ensuring fire safety of industrial facilities based on the calculated determination of fire risk values. The capabilities and features of the program are described. Methods. The methodology for determining the computed values of fire risk at production facilities, approved by the Order of EMERCOM of Russia dated July 10, 2009 No. 404. served as a methodological and regulatory base for writing the IAS “Probit”. The programming languages JavaScript, PHP, Vue.js and Laravel frameworks were used directly for the development of the IAS as well as a MySQL relational database. Findings. The proposed scientific approach allows not only evaluating the effectiveness of using a particular fire protection system on the same equipment, but also comparing fire hazard of different process equipment, that is, to predict, for example, how many times a tank is more dangerous than a distillation column, and a distillation column than a pump or compressor etc. This approach can be used not only to assess the technological equipment fire hazard, but also when insuring production facilities. Research application field. The IAS “Probit” is intended to be used in the activities of EMERCOM of Russia, expert organizations, research and design institutes, as well as higher educational institutions and other educational organizations, when dealing with the issues of confirming the compliance of industrial objects protection with the required level of fire safety, including implementation of final qualifying works, the development of technical specification and company standards. Conclusions. The “Probit” information and analytical system application in educational process can significantly improve the quality of training specialists who are competent in the following areas: methods for assessing the compliance of the object under protection with the requirements of regulations and normative documents; methods for determining fire risk estimated values; fire safety systems for protecting facilities aimed at reducing fire risk."

We present the first comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading commercial LLMs against both a novel 200-prompt CBRN dataset and a 180-prompt subset of the FORTRESS benchmark, using a rigorous three-tier attack methodology. Our findings expose critical safety vulnerabilities: Deep Inception attacks achieve 86.0\\% success versus 33.8\\% for direct requests, demonstrating superficial filtering mechanisms; Model safety performance varies dramatically from 2\\% (claude-opus-4) to 96\\% (mistral-small-latest) attack success rates; and eight models exceed 70\\% vulnerability when asked to enhance dangerous material properties. We identify fundamental brittleness in current safety alignment, where simple prompt engineering techniques bypass safeguards for dangerous CBRN information. These results challenge industry safety claims and highlight urgent needs for standardized evaluation frameworks, transparent safety metrics, and more robust alignment techniques to mitigate catastrophic misuse risks while preserving beneficial capabilities."

      "abstract": "During the study, the research problem was identified that currently the monitoring is used in the management of teacher education in two main aspects. On the one hand, monitoring is seen as a technology of organization of educational process, contributing to solving current educational problems. On the other hand, monitoring acts as a means of obtaining information in the process of research management systems or management controlling. Furthermore, the information resulting from the monitoring is seen as a condition for improvement of different kinds of educational activities.Among the main objectives of monitoring the quality of teacher education include: • strengthening the focus control system of pedagogical education on qualitative aspects; ensuring all levels of management with information about the quality of education; • development of models of quality assurance in teacher education.In accordance with the content of state educational policy goals and objectives of teacher education  the  overall objective of monitoring the quality of teacher education can be defined as the systematic collection and analysis of information that allows you to determine how teacher training system cope with the task of securing the country and specific region-staffed.It can be argued that one of the most important tasks of monitoring is a warning about the dangers of the effective functioning of a successful training masters. Moreover, it is not just a statement of fact and when changes occur that are dangerous, namely a warning about it before the situation  could become irreversible. Also, it is possible to  prevent  or minimize the destructive developments.Thus, by monitoring the quality of teacher education as the system will have two main objectives. 1. How to decompose goals of the individual, society, region and state level goals of the system of pedagogical education (in other words, as goals from consumers of the results of educational activities to build the corresponding objectives for the system of quality education and educational activities). 2. How to align goals of the education system and information about it to determine compliance or noncompliance.Sources of monitoring information may make the results of observations, surveys, measurements, and statistical information. Specific methods of obtaining information and work with it determined by the nature of the  object and the subject of monitoring. The subjects of monitoring the quality of teacher education are carriers of the monitoring functions in the system. Monitoring entities can be  divided into two large groups: the entities providing the information; the entities collecting and processing the information.However, monitoring is primarily a system of continuous monitoring of the socio-economic process, assess its compliance with the set parameters and goals. Monitoring is carried out on the basis of a complex of means of operational monitoring and analysis of process or changes in the condition of a particular object.The objects of monitoring the quality of teacher education is a dynamic, constantly evolving. They are influenced by external and internal influences that can cause unwanted changes in the functioning of the object. Implementation monitoring the quality of teacher education involves the continuous tracking (evaluation study). The regularity of the measurements is determined by the characteristics of the object of monitoring and resource capabilities. The organization of monitoring of the quality of  teacher education provides a selection of sound indicators and indicators. Monitoring is carried out by direct measurement or description of the parameters of the object. Monitoring the quality of teacher education involves the construction of the forecast of development (changes of state) of the system of pedagogical education. 5. Each monitoring system must be targeted to a particular consumer and should be considered as a means of information support of management and educational activities."

Today, the latter part remains true, but the toolkit has innumerous variations that can provide multitudes of new information, by enhancing accuracy, altering perspectives, and offering completely new capabilities. It has been said that in the last 100 years humanity has entered a ‘technological renaissance.’ This rapid period of innovation and exploration includes a significant amount of observation equipment like digital cameras, global positioning systems (GPS), satellites, drones, and even smartphones. Widespread, accessible surveillance devices certainly pose a serious threat to privacy, but the ‘eye(s) in the sky’ can be used for good as well. The foundation of science is solid observation and geologists have many things to observe. Geologists work tirelessly to evaluate and mitigate geologic hazards such as floods, mass movements, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) also known as drones, can carry observatory equipment into the most dangerous or inaccessible places during and after these catastrophic events without compromising safety to gather data."

      "abstract": "Introduction. In the modern world, software (SW) is updated daily, particularly for ground control stations (GCS) of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These systems ' user interfaces (UI) ensure operator interaction with the drone, flight control, mission planning, and realtime data acquisition. These interfaces must be functional, convenient, and intuitive, allowing operators to perform their tasks effectively. Examining global experience allows for an evaluation of existing systems and the identification of areas for improvement. Important aspects include creating intuitive UIs to prevent information overload, ensuring situational awareness, adapting to extreme conditions, and integrating with other systems. The use of virtual and augmented reality technologies, as well as artificial intelligence, can enhance the functionality and convenience of GCS. Such analysis will help in creating safe, efficient, and reliable systems for UAV control. The purpose of the paper is to investigate and conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing user interfaces of software for UAV ground control stations, focusing on their functional capabilities and ease of use. Methods. The following methodological tools were used: concepts of intellectualization of information technologies, the theory of intelligent control, the methodology of building autonomous systems, decision-making theory, and artificial intelligence theory. Results. A review of global experience in user interface development was conducted. The UIs of each of the studied software were analyzed, and their functional capabilities were assessed, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Comparative tables of interface products were compiled based on their functional capabilities and UI usability levels. Generalized recommendations were prepared for creating a unified interface that combines the best features of existing solutions and addresses their shortcomings. Conclusions. The analysis of GCS UI design for UAVs showed that all systems have strengths and weaknesses. The UI of the Mission Planner software has the most extensive capabilities, but it also requires improvement. Future development should add roles for military pilots and operators, develop a more intuitive and user-friendly interface that meets user needs, and simplify SW settings. For working in extreme conditions, the interface needs to be optimized. Enhancements in data visualization will help make information clear and easy to understand, which is critically important in fast-paced and dangerous situations. Keywords: user interface, ground control station, UAV, virtual reality, augmented reality."

      "abstract": "In situations where it is not possible to timely use new methods for assessing hazardous objects, traditional methods of risk assessment can be supplemented with new methods based on possible assessments of objective primary information. Evaluation of the destructive capacity and consequences of the use of high-risk systems becomes increasingly important as their structural and functional complexity grows. Despite the existence of the considered works on certain aspects, the known approaches to the consideration of the problem of indistinguishability of influencing factors are characterized by limited functionality. These capabilities do not fully provide the required level of reliability when making management decisions. In view of this, the problem of predicting equipment failure caused by an unfavourable coincidence of circumstances due to the indistinguishability of the initial data is one of the urgent tasks of risk management. Its solution is of significant theoretical and practical interest for many complex heterogeneous dynamical systems. The paper deals with a problem from the field of probabilistic modeling. The relevance of the performed research lies in the fact that the existing methods for predicting equipment failure in systems of potentially hazardous objects do not take into account the causes of accidents that occurred due to unfavourable circumstances. The aim of the work is to develop a method for the set-theoretic modeling of the occurrence of problems with equipment due to an unfavourable coincidence of circumstances, which provides a range of possible values for the size of a group with a given composite very dangerous sign. To achieve this goal, the following tasks are solved: – finding the range of possible values of the number of groups of objects modeled by the intersection of indistinguishable sets and finding the range of possible values of the number of groups of objects modeled by the union and the difference of indistinguishable sets; – finding possible values of the number of groups of objects modeled by an arbitrary composite property and generalization of the problem, features of the set-theoretic apparatus of its solution. In the course of the study, it was found that a set of objects with a compound very dangerous feature of an arbitrary type can be associated with a set representing the union of intersections (intersection of unions) of sets of objects with simple features and their complements. Moreover, the operations of intersection, union, and complement constitute a complete set of operations for the most common version of Boolean algebra of sets."

      "abstract": "Abstract: The usable energy available from a lithium-based battery energy storage system is affected by factors both internal and external. One of the most influential and potentially dangerous factors is cell charge deviation. This issue is directly addressable with the use of a battery management system and even more through the use of a cell equalization subsystem. There is a wide variety of cell equalization methods that can be used in low, medium, or high-power applications ranging from residential energy backup systems to electric vehicles and industrial load-shifting grid-tied systems. This paper presents a variety of cell equalization methods and compares each of the distinct cell equalization topologies by evaluating different criteria such as equalization rate, power capabilities, complexity and cost. The result of this comparative study is summarized in a set of comprehensive tables that can serve as a guideline to engineers in selecting the best solution for an application. The use of these comparative tables is also illustrated by looking at different real-world case studies."

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can internally distinguish between evaluation and deployment contexts, a behaviour known as \\emph{evaluation awareness}. This undermines AI safety evaluations, as models may conceal dangerous capabilities during testing. Prior work demonstrated this in a single $70$B model, but the scaling relationship across model sizes remains unknown. We investigate evaluation awareness across $15$ models scaling from $0.27$B to $70$B parameters from four families using linear probing on steering vector activations. Our results reveal a clear power-law scaling: evaluation awareness increases predictably with model size. This scaling law enables forecasting deceptive behavior in future larger models and guides the design of scale-aware evaluation strategies for AI safety.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Natural disasters and catastrophes are challenges faced by emergency services. These are dangerous environments in which there are life-threatening victims as in other CBRN incidents, which can add great risks for nearby populations and the environment. The main objective of this project is the development and testing of new technologies that increase the safety and efficiency of the work of first responders in disasters. Method: The SnR consortium, with 28 partners, has designed, implemented, and tested new technologies, with an advanced communication and monitoring system for professionals, victims, and other first responders, with innovative positioning and assistance ICT that facilitate the exploration and evaluation of disaster areas. These technological advances are validated and evaluated with performance, efficiency, and usability indicators, in laboratories and in real working conditions, through a total of seven case studies, in seven different countries, covering a wide range of representative disaster scenarios. Results: The development of a new communication and monitoring system for professionals and victims, coordinated on the Concorde platform, together with chemical alert sensors, synchronized with smartwatches, smart uniforms, and pediatric immobilizers, are some of the tools tested. The pilots carried out to confirm the usefulness of the 26 technological tools designed and tested in the field, which have helped to reduce the damage and casualties that can occur in S&R operations. Conclusion: In conclusion, the H2020 European Search and Rescue project (S&R), through the development of new technologies, offers a holistic approach to the effective response to emergencies and provides increased capabilities and resources to first responders in the field, increasing their effectiveness and safety. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement (No. 882897)."

      "abstract": "The catalytic converter serves a crucial function in mitigating vehicle emissions by effectively limiting the release of dangerous pollutants into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, the inclusion of a catalytic converter inside the exhaust system has a discernible effect on the emission of exhaust gases from internal combustion engines. The proposed design aims to enhance the fluid flow rate in the nanoparticles based catalytic converter by improving upon the existing monolith design, surpassing the capabilities of conventional designs. The conventional and enhanced models are designed using computer-aided design (CAD) software and subsequently evaluated using the ANSYS software, specifically employing the FLUENT solver. The flow results are shown, including a comparison between the conventional design and the newly enhanced design. The proposed design incorporating shape modification offers enhanced fluid flow capabilities compared to the standard approach."

      "abstract": "Existing legal frameworks on AI rely on training compute thresholds as a proxy to identify potentially-dangerous AI models and trigger increased regulatory attention. In the United States, Section 4.2(a) of Executive Order 14110 instructs the Secretary of Commerce to require extensive reporting from developers of AI models above a certain training compute threshold. In the European Union, Article 51 of the AI Act establishes a presumption that AI models above a certain compute threshold have high impact capabilities and hence pose systemic risk, thus subjecting their developers to several obligations including capability evaluations, reporting, and incident monitoring. In this paper, we examine some enhancement techniques that are capable of decreasing training compute usage while preserving, or even increasing, model capabilities. Since training compute thresholds rely on training compute as a metric and trigger for increased regulatory attention, these capability-enhancing and compute-saving techniques could constitute a legal loophole to existing training compute thresholds. In particular, we concentrate on four illustrative techniques (fine-tuning, model reuse, model expansion, and above compute-optimal inference compute) with the goal of furthering the conversation about their implications on training compute thresholds as a legal mechanism and advancing policy recommendations that could address the relevant legal loopholes."

      "abstract": "High-impact and potentially dangerous capabilities can and should be broken down into early warning shots long before reaching red lines. Each of these early warning shots should correspond to a precursory capability. Each precursory capability sits on a spectrum indicating its proximity to a final high-impact capability, corresponding to a red line. To meaningfully detect and track capability progress, we propose a taxonomy of dangerous capability zones (a zoning taxonomy) tied to a staggered information exchange framework that enables relevant bodies to take action accordingly. In the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, signatories commit to sharing more detailed information with trusted actors, including an appointed body, as appropriate (Commitment VII). Building on our zoning taxonomy, this paper makes four recommendations for specifying information sharing as detailed in Commitment VII. (1) Precursory capabilities should be shared as soon as they become known through internal evaluations before deployment. (2) AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) should be the trusted actors appointed to receive and coordinate information on precursory components. (3) AISIs should establish adequate information protection infrastructure and guarantee increased information security as precursory capabilities move through the zones and towards red lines, including, if necessary, by classifying the information on precursory capabilities or marking it as controlled. (4) High-impact capability progress in one geographical region may translate to risk in other regions and necessitates more comprehensive risk assessment internationally. As such, AISIs should exchange information on precursory capabilities with other AISIs, relying on the existing frameworks on international classified exchanges and applying lessons learned from other regulated high-risk sectors."

      "abstract": "This paper provides the recent advances and researches about non-destructive testing paper covers the review on the capabilities of NDT applications such as Visual Testing (VT), Ultrasonic Testing (UT), Radiographic Testing (RT), Electromagnetic Testing (ET), Acoustic Emission (AE) and Dye Penetrate testing( DPT) with respect to advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Further methods are classified on basis of their intrinsic characteristics and their applications. Mostly, an NDT evaluator uses only one non-destructive test method to perform the evaluation. If the scope of work is straight forward, using a single test method is acceptable. However, there are times when a single test method does not provide enough information about the material integrity And thereby combination of different methods is essential. Non destructive testing is widely applied in power plants, aerospace, nuclear industry, military and defiance, storage tank inspection, pipe and tube inspection and composite defects characterization. This paper mainly focuses on the scope of NDT application for composite materials The use of Industrial Radiography for examining the quality of Weld joints is very popular worldwide. In India, many welding activities like construction and laying the huge pipelines for gas and water transportation and distribution as well construction of storage tanks are performed. The objects are working under high pressure and therefore, it is important to produce the weld beads with high quality. Industrial radiography uses ionizing radiation to view objects in a way that cannot be seen otherwise. The method has grown out of engineering, and is a major element of Non destructive testing (NDT) to inspect materials for hidden flaws. The radiation caused by these facilities is very dangerous however, with the use of new technologies and proper protection, risks of injury and death associated with radiation can be greatly reduced. Radiographic Testing (RT) is widely used in industries, at airport for security checks, medical applications etc. to detect anomalies in materials and human bodies. Radiographic Testing is the common NDT methods used in the construction and fabrication industries for the oil & gas sectors using welding, gas/liquid transmission pipelines, casting foundries, and condition monitoring in existing oil & gas refineries and facilities. This paper will discuss radiographic testing sensitivity using industrial X-ray films mainly on welds and castings. No in-depth discussion in related science and physics, merely the perspective of an industrial radiographer based on his experience.

      "abstract": "With the many advancements in automobile technology, there has been a sharp increase in the number of sensors and systems present in vehicles. This has enabled a rapid increase in the features and capabilities available in modern automobiles but has also vastly increased their vulnerability surface. Attackers are now able to remotely attack and control some facets of modern automobiles, which creates dangerous situations for drivers and passengers. In order to address this, this paper proposes a self-attention bottleneck network utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture. This is used as an anomaly detection system (ADS) that can detect anomalous behavior present within CAN bus communications. We evaluated this approach using a publicly available CAN bus car hacking dataset and show that our architecture is able to achieve an accuracy of over 99% for detecting anomalies present in CAN bus data."

      "abstract": "Abstract The degradation of concrete structures is significantly influenced by water penetration since water serves as the primary vehicle for the movement of harmful compounds. The process of capillary water absorption is widely recognized as a crucial indicator of durability for unsaturated concrete, as it allows dangerous substances to enter the composite material. The water absorption capacity of concrete is intricately linked to its pore structure, as concrete is inherently porous. The main goal of this work is to create an innovative predictive tool that assesses the porosity of concrete by analyzing its components using a machine-learning (ML) framework. Seven distinct batch design variables were included in the generated database: fly ash, superplasticizer, water-to-binder ratio, curing time, ground granulated blast furnace slag, binder, and coarse-to-fine aggregate ratio. Four distant ML algorithms, including AdaBoost, linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM), are utilized to infer the generalization capabilities of ML algorithms to estimate concrete porosity accurately. The RReliefF algorithm was implemented to calculate the significant features influencing porosity. This study concludes that in comparison to the alternative techniques, the AdaBoost method demonstrated superior performance with an R 2 score of 0.914, followed by SVM (0.870), DT (0.838), and LR (0.763). The results of the evaluation of RReliefF indicated that the binder possesses a remarkable influence on the porosity of concrete."

There are many different ways to counter drones and a new medium caliber round may prove to be the best solution. The biggest issue in building this round is finding a power source that is cost-effective while also meeting stakeholder requirements. This study seeks to solve this issue by using a value modeling approach that scores each power source alternative based on metrics that are key to the stakeholder. The first step was to research power source alternatives that met stakeholder requirements. Each alternative was then given a value score based on their respective characteristics. The next step was to create a value versus cost trade space analysis, which provides insight into the tradeoff between value and cost. The analysis shows four feasible alternatives with low costs, and one alternative with a significantly higher cost and value."

      "abstract": "Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have been proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However, these approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities and strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome multilingual vulnerability limitation. Although some work has begun to explore LLM’s repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate the performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and state-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o, instruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the leading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows superior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to repair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o demonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen language, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows that Go consistently achieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs the worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promising of LLM on multilingual vulnerability repair and reasons behind LLM failed cases. This work takes the first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages, highlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs to multilingual vulnerability repair."

      "abstract": "Pipeline infrastructures, moving either gas or oil from one place to another through their entire lifespan, suffer from internal corrosion. This phenomenon could be very dangerous both for the environment and human being. The former due to potential leakages of the fluids carried by the infrastructure itself, whereas the latter due to accidents which may cause explosions in presence of gas leakages. Therefore, it is crucial to design predictive mechanisms able to improve prevention and control of this phenomenon [1]. Unfortunately, the pipeline corrosion is not understood to the point of developing a mechanistic model, which would solve the prevention and control needs associated to the management of such infrastructures. Moreover, the phenomenon is complex enough to cause semi-empirical models to fail in reproducing its behavior. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have proven their capabilities in modeling complex phenomena given enough and appropriate data, becoming a promising potential solution for corrosion prediction. Unfortunately, in the literature, the proposed solutions are based on small data sets or the performance evaluations are not appropriately performed impairing the claims and the obtained results. For these reasons, in this paper, we introduce a ML-based approach to model the corrosion phenomenon comprising the data set creation, the definition of the ML-based model and its evaluation. Finally, we apply the above mentioned solution on real-world data."

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape. This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this\"benchmark-regulation gap.\"We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation ecosystem dedicates the vast majority of its focus to a narrow set of behavioral propensities. On average, benchmarks devote 61.6% of their regulatory-relevant questions to\"Tendency to hallucinate\"and 31.2% to\"Lack of performance reliability\", while critical functional capabilities are dangerously neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios, including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This study provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, demonstrating that current public benchmarks are insufficient, on their own, for providing the evidence of comprehensive risk assessment required for regulatory compliance and offering critical insights for the development of next-generation evaluation tools."

      "abstract": "Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as\"sandbagging\"- threatens to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of frontier model evaluations."

      "abstract": ". Acinetobacter baumannii has become one of the most dangerous global health pathogens in nosocomial infections, exhibiting increasing resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. This resistance presents challenges in treatment and highlights the pressing need for innovative approaches to address these infections. Therefore, our investigation focuses on the ability of extracts produced from specific freshwater plants and seagrasses to inhibit the growth of A. baumannii . Moreover, we explore the potential synergistic effects of these natural extracts when used together with certain antibiotics. Our study evaluates the synergistic antibacterial effects between these extracts and antibiotics via the agar diffusion assay. The results showed that extracts from some species of freshwater plants were more effective in inhibiting the growth of A. baumannii than extracts from seagrasses. The variation in effectiveness is due to the solvents used for extraction and their differing capabilities. It is well known that A. baumannii has an inherent resistance to various classes of antibiotics, but this study also showed that certain plant extracts had substantial synergistic effects against the tested pathogenic microbe. This work demonstrates the potential of natural plant extracts as a complementary adjunct options to standard antibiotic therapy."

      "abstract": "Open-weight large language models (LLMs) unlock huge benefits in innovation, personalization, privacy, and democratization. However, their core advantage - modifiability - opens the door to systemic risks: bad actors can trivially subvert current safeguards, turning beneficial models into tools for harm. This leads to a'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a model with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those safeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for state-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical and cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from two families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to 405B) using different safeguard removal techniques. Our experiments reveal that the safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous capabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the Safety Gap Toolkit (https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/safety-gap) will serve as an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation for developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards. We welcome contributions to the toolkit from the community."

      "abstract": "Today, unmanned systems have become one of the key weapons in the war against Russia, new and different ways of using these systems are being introduced, and the search for new ways of using them continues. For example, the Armed Forces of Ukraine use walking unmanned ground complexes of the Robot Dog type due to the features of the design, as well as mass, dimensions and cargo capabilities. Complexes of the Robot Dog type are already used for humanitarian missions, for example, they are used for demining territories. They also perform security and surveillance functions, patrolling the territory; study of hard-to-reach places, monitoring and reconnaissance, data collection in dangerous or difficult conditions. Such complexes are used for the transportation of light cargo (medical equipment or necessary resources). \nThe article analyzes modern popular multifunctional biomorphic walking ground platforms - unmanned ground complexes of the Robot Dog type. Their functions and capabilities are considered, and the tasks performed today by walking unmanned ground systems of the Robot Dog type in the armed forces of the leading countries of the world are given. The main tactical and technical characteristics of these samples are provided. \nThe evaluation of the level of technical perfection by the proportional scale and the \"rating-weight\" scale of the five most common samples of walking unmanned ground complexes of the Robot Dog type was carried out, and the influence of negative indicators of the technical perfection of the sample on its comprehensive evaluation. The rating among the studied samples of the same type of walking unmanned ground complexes of the Robot Dog type was determined."

      "abstract": "Underwater docking is critical to enable the persistent operation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). For this, the AUV must be capable of detecting and localizing the docking station, which is complex due to the highly dynamic undersea environment. Image-based solutions offer a high acquisition rate and versatile alternative to adapt to this environment; however, the underwater environment presents challenges such as low visibility, high turbidity, and distortion. In addition to this, field experiments to validate underwater docking capabilities can be costly and dangerous due to the specialized equipment and safety considerations required to conduct the experiments. This work compares different deep-learning architectures to perform underwater docking detection and classification. The architecture with the best performance is then compressed using knowledge distillation under the teacher-student paradigm to reduce the network's memory footprint, allowing real-time implementation. To reduce the simulation-to-reality gap, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to do image-to-image translation, converting the Gazebo simulation image into a realistic underwater-looking image. The obtained image is then processed using an underwater image formation model to simulate image attenuation over distance under different water types. The proposed method is finally evaluated according to the AUV docking success rate and compared with classical vision methods. The simulation results show an improvement of 20% in the high turbidity scenarios regardless of the underwater currents. Furthermore, we show the performance of the proposed approach by showing experimental results on the off-the-shelf AUV Iver3."

      "abstract": "Urban Air Mobility is a new concept of regional aviation that has been growing in popularity as a solution to the issue of ever-increasing ground traffic. Electric vehicles with vertical take-off and landing capabilities are being developed by numerous market companies as a result of the push toward environmentally sustainable aviation. The next stage in the eVTOL development process would be to define the concept of operation of these conceptual aircraft and then to integrate them with the existing airspace once they are airborne. In addition to coordinating with conventional air traffic and other Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles, collision avoidance with uncooperative airspace users has to be addressed. Birds and drones of all sizes could be dangerous for these low-flying aircraft. Innovative collision detection and avoidance techniques need to be employed due to the uncooperative nature of these airspace users and different performance characteristics of urban air mobility vehicles compared to classical fixed-wing aircraft. The aim of this study is to validate one such system by means of fast-time solutions. This system uses a decision tree and safety envelopes to prevent collisions with non-cooperative airspace members. The system is designed to work with different aircraft configurations used for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations. Various scenarios are modelled by varying intruder type, location, flight path among others. Changes in flight time and closest point of approach are assessed to evaluate the system with regard to safety and efficiency."

      "abstract": "In today’s digital communication environment, the outbreak of public crisis events is often accompanied by the rapid spread of public opinion information and immediate feedback of public sentiment, forming a complex public opinion field. Traditional public opinion monitoring methods lack dynamic modeling capabilities, making it difficult to cope with the multiple challenges of the variability in the speed of public opinion dissemination, the heterogeneity of stages, and the complexity of emotional tendencies. To cope with this problem, a three-dimensional indicator system based on the dissemination time, scale and emotional tendency of netizens is proposed, and the weight parameters are determined by the hierarchical analysis method (AHP) and the Delphi method, which is combined with the three-dimensional visualization technology to dynamically track the trajectory of public opinion evolution and realize the four-level risk grading from slight to dangerous. The experimental results show that the model can effectively identify public opinion events of different risk levels. By dynamically adjusting the weights of the indicators, the model can adapt to the complex changes of public opinion events. In the future, we will further optimize the model parameters and combine it with machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to enhance the monitoring capability and explore its application value in multiple fields."

      "abstract": "Embedded computing systems are becoming increasingly complex. Modern system-on-chips come with heterogeneous designs that integrate diverse processing systems and a large variety of peripherals. When considering software with mixed and independent security and criticality levels, the heterogeneity of modern computing platforms poses considerable challenges in achieving strong isolation between execution domains. Tackling these challenges is even more difficult in platforms that integrate Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) fabrics, which, due to their wide flexibility, introduce new security- and safety-related threats that can jeopardize isolation. As a matter of fact, if no proper countermeasures are in place, hardware accelerators (HAs) deployed on FPGA can be exploited to break the isolation capabilities implemented in a system by issuing dangerous bus transactions. This research proposes a design flow for heterogeneous platforms to strongly isolate bus transactions issued by HAs. The design flow is then specialized for the AMD Zynq UltraScale+ platform, leveraging the virtualizationrelated features of the Arm System Memory Management Unit (SMMU). The proposed solution jointly combines two new IPs for enforcing information transported by the AXI bus, a tool to verify the FPGA design, a principled configuration of the SMMU driver, and a secure boot flow. The proposal is evaluated with an industry-relevant use case related to embedded machine learning applied for the railway domain, in which isolation is established between two AMD Deep Learning Processor Units (DPU) and a set of FPGA HAs dedicated to a real-time critical application."

      "abstract": "Reconstructing human dynamics in in-bed scenarios is important in dangerous behaviors detection, pressure sore prevention and sleep quality monitoring. Compared to RGB cameras, which are susceptible to obstruction and privacy concerns, pressure-sensitive bedsheets are gaining increasing attention for such tasks due to their non-invasive and privacy-preserving advantages. However, recovering a 3D human mesh from a single pressure image is challenging due to pressure information ambiguity, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty. Diffusion models, leveraging their powerful fitting capabilities and editing abilities, are promising candidates for addressing this challenge. Therefore, we propose a Pressure Image-supported Diffusion framework for Human Mesh Reconstruction (PIDHMR), which includes a direct regression of the human body model parameters and a follow-up optimization using information automatically detected from pressure images. For regression, we improve the existing diffusion model structure and training objectives to meet the task requirements for generating 3D human shapes from pressure images. For optimization, we examine human-related information that can be used to improve the predicted human mesh from pressure images (i.e., contact area, joints positions, and temporal consistency), and design optimization losses to utilize these information to improve the spatial position, posture, and motion smoothness separately. Ultimately, PIDHMR is evaluated on the public temporal pressure dataset, TIP, and achieves 72.83mm joint position errors, outperforming the state-of-the-art method PIMesh, which achieves 79.17mm."

      "abstract": "The ESO Paranal Observatory is the site of the UT4 YEPUN telescope, which accommodates four TOPTICA-MPB Laser Guide Star Units (LGSUs) within its Adaptive Optics Facility (AOF). Additionally, three similar laser systems are scheduled for installation, with each telescope housing one laser unit, resulting in a total of seven lasers at Paranal. Preparations are underway at the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) to integrate six more lasers. Recently we have introduced innovative strategies to guarantee the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of operations and technical maintenance. Pivotal initiatives include enhancing real-time monitoring of systems and subsystems. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of system usage, leading to optimized strategies and a 20% increase in the lifespan of critical components. Furthermore, the implementation of automated monitoring for critical system parameters has effectively decreased the necessity for visual inspections, thereby optimizing staffing allocation. The meticulous monitoring of environmental parameters within the telescope, coupled with the development of AI tools, facilitates the timely detection of deviations from technical specifications, triggering warnings and alarms. The AI tools also exhibit the potential to predict dangerous variations in the environment that affect system performance, enabling proactive measures to reduce troubleshooting time and ensuring data-driven interventions. The development of tools for comprehensive data analysis, covering health checks and operational logs of laser units, has resulted in a remarkable 25% reduction in staffing allocation for this activity. This streamlined process expedites fault analysis and facilitates the swift identification of the root cause of critical issues. Through the implementation of these strategic initiatives, we are not only enhancing the performance and longevity of the 4LGSF but also securing its sustained contribution to the scientific community. These efforts underscore our commitment to advancing technological capabilities and operational efficiency in astronomical research."

      "abstract": "The productivity and accuracy machine parts often depend on the dynamic processes during machine and cutting operation. The increase requirements for machining operation and quality machine parts leads to the need to evaluate and take into account all the capabilities of the technological processing system (TS) to ensure the stability of the cutting process and increase speed. One of the features emergence and existence of self-oscillating processes, the least studied and dangerous in terms of the effect on sustainability ТS is the nonlinearity parameters elastic system of the machine tool and the processes occurring during cutting operation. Therefore, to assess the conditions for implementation of the cutting process with a steady limited amplitude of oscillations, it is necessary to analyze and take into account the main nonlinearities dynamics of the TS. The article considers dynamic processes in high-speed processing systems on the example of high-precision spindle assemblies, with analysis and following review of their different types nonlinearity. The machine tool spindle unit for the case of high-speed processing according to the working conditions approaches the scheme of the rotor system which self-oscillations can be caused by the action of non-conservative circulation-type forces that are not associated with external periodic loads or any resonant relationships: internal friction forces, hydrodynamic forces in sliding bearings and seals, electrodynamic and electromagnetic forces in the electrical components of motor-spindles. It is shown that if the nonlinearity is associated only with internal external friction and coefficients of friction forces do not depend on frequency, the amplitude and frequency of self-oscillations (unlike linear system) will depend only on relationship of friction forces."

      "abstract": "Rescue robots can perform rescue missions in dangerous and complex environments, protect humans from harm, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of rescue, thus playing an increasingly important role in disaster management and rescue. This article reviews the technologies and methods required to apply artificial intelligence to rescue robot teams. Firstly, the feasibility of motion control for swarm robots was explored from the perspective of biomimetic robots. Through the analysis of animal biomimetics and the comparison of commonly used topological structures, the nature of team rescue robot rescue is emphasized, and based on this, a scheme for optimizing topological networks by combining environmental intelligence is proposed. Secondly, several existing micro robots were introduced and their data loading capabilities were evaluated. On this basis, the process of robot vision and motion commands was outlined. At the meanwhile, researchers focus on the current mainstream robot motion trajectory algorithms, and study the algorithm optimization process from extending the motion path planning of a single robot to group coordinated motion. This includes traditional cell decomposition algorithms and algorithms combined with machine learning to improve path planning efficiency. Finally, the above methods were summarized, and the impact of other possible feasible methods in the field of artificial intelligence was explored and analyzed."

      "abstract": "The materials of this scientific article consider the possibility of using a virtual laboratory stand during the laboratory work carried out by students of higher education institutions under the name «Measurement of the resistance to the spread of the current of grounding devices, the specific resistance of the soil, the insulation of networks and electrical installations». This laboratory work is included in the curriculum of the normative educational component «Occupational safety in the industry and civil protection». The article examines the specific advantages of using a virtual stand, in particular its role in improving the quality of the educational process, expanding access to resources, and optimizing educational costs. \nThe purpose of this article is to consider the main possibilities of using the proposed virtual laboratory stand as an innovative approach in the study of complex technical processes and ensuring a high level of training during laboratory work on the topic «Measurement of resistance to the spread of current of grounding devices, soil resistivity, insulation of networks and electrical installations». \nThis laboratory work is a component of the curriculum of the normative educational component aimed at forming in students the ability to identify, analyze and evaluate potential risks associated with the production environment, and which is entitled «Occupational Safety and Civil Protection». Particular attention is paid to the methodology of conducting laboratory work using a virtual stand, including steps for configuring the software, algorithms for performing measurements and analyzing the received data. Methods of simulating various measurement conditions are described in detail, allowing students to practice scenarios that would be difficult or dangerous to implement in real conditions. \nIn the materials of the article, an overview of the interface and functionality of the developed computer program, which reproduces the control components of real laboratory equipment and is intended for the implementation of the functions of a virtual laboratory stand, is reviewed, the key capabilities of the proposed program are described, including the simulation of various laboratory scenarios and the availability of theoretical materials necessary for preparing and conducting a laboratory session, as well as a detailed reproduction of the appearance and control components of real experimental laboratory equipment, which contributes to the creation of a feeling of working with physical devices, the implementation of mathematical models that accurately describe the dependence of output parameters on input parameters. It was also found that the use of similar technologies during other laboratory works from the above-mentioned normative educational component requires further thorough systematic research and publication of their results."

      "abstract": "After initial human excursions to the moon and Mars, space flights will become even more ambitious, with longer sojourns (beyond Mars), longer surface stays, and more ambitious activities (building habitats, long-term settlement, mining and resource extraction). These missions will eventually be so complex and dangerous that we will no longer be able to depend on either the humans or the spacecraft systems to be at peak performance throughout the entire duration (due to injuries, breakdowns, and normal degradation). Yet, this human-spacecraft system will be called on to perform for extended periods at a very high level. We can't expect people on missions of this duration and complexity to dig in and tough it out. They will need help. The same applies to the machines. It will be necessary to have constant monitoring and customization of the spacecraft to the crew and mission, as they all change over the course of a flight. Just as the human crew must maintain spacecraft capability, so it will be part of the role of the spacecraft to help maintain the capabilities of the human crew. There are many aspects of this, which reach far beyond traditional considerations of health and medicine. Overall performance - and in particular the ability to carry out tasks that are critical to mission success - must be prioritized, and the crew and machine (spacecraft and its subsystems) must work together to make decisions as to how to maintain that performance in the face of demanding and changing conditions. A flexible architecture, based on identifying, tracking, modifying, and retaining the ability to carry out mission-critical tasks, will be of utmost importance. We propose such an architecture: • Sensors and embedded measures, to monitor physiological and environmental status, and human and spacecraft performance. • Guided activities as needed, to assess human capabilities for mission tasks (e.g., specific monitored exercise to evaluate upper-body strength before an EVA). • A model of factors, connections, capabilities, mission tasks, and expected outcomes and a method for using this model to understand and predict the effect of the factors on mission success. • Prediction of the likelihood of being able to successfully carry out mission goals given the current and anticipated status of the crew and spacecraft-and prescribed interventions and mitigations as needed to maintain those capabilities. • Interventions (automated or advisory) to modify some aspect of the crew's situation (lighting, food, schedule, workload, etc.) in order to maintain capabilities and avoid undesired adverse critical transitions. • Help with what-if scenarios to reassess goals as circumstances change (spacecraft and crew capabilities). • A model in the form of a Contributing Factor Map [1], augmented with a set of mission tasks [2], and an overall framework to maintain performance [3]."

The era of globalization makes the state continue to evaluate its defense capabilities in the face of threats whose forms and patterns have changed, including the entry of dangerous goods. Customs and Excise is one of the law enforcers at sea, primarily related to supervising customs and excise activities. The purpose of writing this paper is to prevent strategies to prevent the illegal importation of dangerous goods in building national resilience by the role of customs and excise as a community protector by using 4 (four) strategy implementation factors, namely management, organizational structure, organizational culture, and organizational information systems. The author uses qualitative research methods with data collection techniques, such as interviews, observation, and documentation. From the research conducted, it can be concluded that the placement of employees has not included particular expertise, the existence of joint programs to maximize supervisory activities, the use of machines in supervisory activities, the leadership has encouraged organizational culture, the organizational structure is by the regulations, the creation of the AN.TA.RE.J.A application (analyzing, targeting and reporting for joint programs) in supporting supervisory activities."

      "abstract": "Abstract. Landslides are one of the most dangerous natural disasters worldwide. Al Hoceima region, Part of the Moroccan mountain chain of the Rif is not an exception, since it’s dominated by relatively young reliefs and marked by its dynamics compared to other regions. The main goal of this study is to assess the performance of Machine learning algorithms and identify the optimal method for the mapping of the area susceptible to landslides, in Al Hoceima city and its periphery, The current study aimed at evaluating the capabilities of six advanced machine learning algorithms including, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), XGBoost (XGB) and Logistic Regression (LR). A total of 114 landslides were mapped from various sources. 70% of this database was used for model building and 30% for validation. Ten landslide factors are selected to detect the most sensitive areas: altitude, slope, aspect, distance to faults, distance from roads, lithology, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, and vegetation index (NDVI). The outcome of the landslide susceptibility analysis was verified using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and precision-recall curves (PRC), acknowledging XGBoost and Random Forest as the optimal methods with AUCROC (96% and 95.5% accordingly), a severe imbalanced classification was detected by the PRC, solved by undersampling the majority class, to obtain major improvement in models performance according to AUCPRC (from 40% to 87% for XGBoost) and slight decrease according to AUCROC (from 96% to 94% for XGBoost). The outcome of this study and the landslide susceptibility maps would be useful for environmental, economic, and social protection and to help formulate suggestions for optimizing landslide risk assessment in areas exposed to this phenomenon.\n"

      "abstract": "Today, models capable of working with various modalities simultaneously in a chat format are gaining increasing popularity. Despite this, there is an issue of potential attacks on these models, especially considering that many of them include open-source components. It is important to study whether the vulnerabilities of these components are inherited and how dangerous this can be when using such models in the industry. This work is dedicated to researching various types of attacks on such models and evaluating their generalization capabilities. Modern VLM models (LLaVA, BLIP, etc.) often use pre-trained parts from other models, so the main part of this research focuses on them, specifically on the CLIP architecture and its image encoder (CLIP-ViT) and various patch attack variations for it."

      "abstract": "Enforcing security requirements in networked information systems relies on security controls to mitigate the risks from increasingly dangerous threats. Configuring security controls is challenging; even nowadays, administrators must perform it without adequate tool support. Hence, this process is plagued by errors that translate to insecure postures, security incidents, and a lack of promptness in answering threats. This paper presents the Security Capability Model (SCM), a formal model that abstracts the features that security controls offer for enforcing security policies, which includes an Information Model that depicts the basic concepts related to rules (i.e., conditions, actions, events) and policies (i.e., conditions' evaluation, resolution strategies, default actions), and a Data Model that covers the capabilities needed to describe different types of filtering and channel protection controls. Following state-of-the-art design patterns, the model allows for generating abstract versions of the security controls' languages and a model-driven approach for translating abstract policies into device-specific configuration settings. By validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we show that SCM enables the automation of different and complex security tasks, i.e., accurate and granular security control comparison, policy refinement, and incident response. Lastly, we present opportunities for extensions and integration with other frameworks and models."

      "abstract": "Nighttime driving is difficult owing to low visibility and lights. Nighttime accidents are more dangerous due to reduced obstacle detection, poor vision, and trouble evaluating distances. Knowing the causes and dynamics of nighttime accidents is essential for improving road safety and preventing collisions when natural light is limited. This study proposes using an infrared thermal sensor to assist drivers in mitigating the issue of inadequate light at night, with the ultimate goal of preventing crashes under such circumstances. The investigation compared the infrared thermal camera sensor with the normal camera visual to evaluate how well it worked at night. The testing has been done on the road in Pekan, Pahang. Yolov8 deep learning has been integrated with both cameras to detect items like cars, motorcycles, and traffic lights. The test findings demonstrated how temperature variations can be utilized to precisely detect items on different types of roadways. The study showed that infrared thermal sensors are impressive at detecting traffic lamps, motorcycles, and vehicles. The infrared camera's actual detection on confusion matrices was 0.98 for traffic lamps and 0.87 for motorcycles and vehicles. This shows how well the infrared thermal camera works in dark conditions, with a faster frame rate of 64.94 fps than regular cameras at 55.25 fps. The results of this study demonstrate that using infrared technology can enhance object detection capabilities and, hence, enhance nighttime road safety."

      "abstract": "With a focus on the strategic competition between the United States and Russia, this paper explores the prospects for the future of arms control under an intensifying nuclear security dilemma. The end of stability-enhancing agreements such as the INF Treaty and Open Skies has accelerated the arms race. What is the future of New START and are we likely to see any extension beyond 2021? The relationship between arms control and strategic stability is part of this evaluation, particularly with respect to how states view the concept framed within their national security interests. The provocative role that offensive – deterrence by denial – capabilities play in contributing to strategic instability is central to this study. This work looks particularly at new systems designed for asymmetric advantage, including those that can defeat strategic defences, such as longer-range cruise missiles and hypersonic vehicles. Under conditions of modernizations and upgrades to nuclear arsenals, including the entanglement of conventional and nuclear systems that can threaten a first strike, this work considers how a dialogue on limiting dangerous systems could be initiated between the US and Russia. Could New START be revised – or a new treaty established – to limit advances in cruise missile technology, hypersonics, missile defences, and tactical nuclear weapons?"

      "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a highly toxic and dangerous gas with a flammable and corrosive nature, making the development of reliable gas sensors for its detection vital. This study investigated the enhancement in H2S gas sensing performance of commercial SnO2 powders after high-energy milling. SnO2 powders were subjected to high-energy milling for 30, 60, and 90 min and then were characterized using advanced techniques to evaluate their morphology, chemical composition, and crystallinity. The response of a pristine SnO2 gas sensor, and ones where the SnO2 was milled for 30, 60 and 90 min, were 2.46, 2.27, 3.01, and 1.98, respectively, to 10 ppm H2S at 300°C. Thus, the H2S gas sensing results revealed that the SnO2 powders milled for 60 min exhibited the highest sensing performance. This improvement in H2S sensing performance was attributable to the reduced particle sizes achieved through the high-energy milling process, which increased the surface area and created defects on the surface of the SnO2 particles, thereby enhancing the interaction between the gas molecules and sensor material. The smaller morphological size of the particles and surface defects subsequently promoted the resistance modulation crucial for H2S gas detection. This study demonstrates that high-energy ball milling can effectively boost the gas-sensing features of SnO2 powders. The findings can provide guidance for enhancing the gas-sensing capabilities of other resistive sensors."

      "abstract": "Continuum robots are widely used in spacecraft interior detection and dangerous environment detection due to their multiple degrees of freedom and adaptability to narrow spaces. However, the shape perception problem of continuum robots seriously affects their closed-loop control and precise operation capabilities. This paper proposes a shape perception method based on a structural sensing integrated module, which helps to achieve high-precision shape perception of space continuum robots. First, the structural sensing integrated module is designed and its kinematics model is analyzed. Second, the data obtained by the sensor are processed by Kalman filtering, and a multiple keypoint error compensation method based on the BP neural network model is proposed. Next, a shape perception method based on Bezier curves is introduced, and a shape fitting accuracy evaluation index considering global information is designed. Then, an experiment is carried out on a shape perception test platform to verify the shape perception method of the continuum robot based on the BP neural network, and the experiments showed that its average relative distance error is less than 2.5%. Finally, slit crossing and docking tests are carried out on the space continuum robot, and the arrival accuracy is better than 3.5mm, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed shape perception method and its potential application in actual space missions."

      "abstract": "Introduction. Maintaining good health and working capacity of the population is one of the main tasks of the healthcare system. Living under adverse climatic conditions of the North and being exposed to dangerous production factors of the pulp and paper industry, strongly represented in the Arkhangelsk Region, can significantly reduce the adaptive capacity of the body. Major role in providing an adequate response to the action of irritators and initiating the adaptation process is played by the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and circulatory systems, which reflect qualitative and quantitative changes in the body while being reliable markers of homeostasis. The aim was to study the adaptive potential of workers showing the level of functioning of the circulatory system and to evaluate their endocrine profile depending on the revealed functional capabilities of the body. Materials and methods. The study involved 50 men aged 22–60 years working in the production departments of Solombala Pulp and Paper Mill (Arkhangelsk) with a body mass index of 19–25 and without earlier history of endocrine pathology. Serum levels of thyroxine-binding globulin and oestradiol were determined by means of radioimmunoassay, while serum concentrations of total cortisol, thyrotropin, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, progesterone, testosterone, insulin, C-peptide, and somatotropin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. The research demonstrated that in 2/3 of the examined employees of the pulp and paper mill the adaptation mechanisms were under strain, while the condition of two subjects corresponded to the physiological norm, which is characterized by good and satisfactory adaptation. Workers with decreased adaptive capabilities to the point of unsatisfactory adaptation showed increased levels of cortisol, thyroxine-binding globulin, oestradiol, C-peptide, and insulin against the background of a decrease in testosterone, progesterone, and the testosterone/oestradiol ratio. The authors recommend conducting periodic medical examinations of pulp and paper workers, including endocrine profile assessment, and monitoring changes that occur over time."

These large models have demonstrated potential to generate, debug, test, analyze, document, and even translate code. Thus they are a valuable tool in the software development cycle. If used correctly, such tools can often accelerate the development cycle. Though the tools are powerful and new, the community is cautious of training using biased or sensitive data, which can lead to biased, dangerous, or incorrect outputs along with the inadvertent release of confidential information. Additionally, the carbon footprints and the un-explainability of these \"black box\" models continue to raise questions about the reliability of LLMs.With these opportunities and these challenges ahead, this paper explores the idea of \"judging\" LLM-generated code to better understand and \"open up\" the un-explainable \"black box\" models used by LLMs. We probe into the black box of one such LLM that has generated the best compiler tests for the directive-based programming models OpenMP and OpenACC in our earlier research. We challenge DeepSeek’s deepseek-coder-33B-instruct model with intentionally-erroneous code, and we also define relevant metrics and adopt an agent-based approach to evaluate the LLM and assess its capabilities as an LLM-as-a-judge. We also develop a pipeline-based approach to streamline the entire workflow. Finally, we make use of all of these strategies together to develop a more reliable method for automatically validating LLM-generated compiler tests. Based on our results, utilizing an agent-based prompting approach and setting up a validation pipeline structure drastically increased the quality of deepseek-coder-33B-instruct evaluation of tests which are used to validate compiler implementations of directive-based parallel programming models."

      "abstract": "Abstract UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) are commonly used in 3D (dull, dirty and dangerous) missions, because these are not endangering the operators life, while reduce maintenance costs and increase maneuvering capabilities. Despite of these advantages we should consider the possible vulnerabilities of this technology as well. Unmanned vehicles can be controlled via direct communication link, or they can work in a preprogrammed mode. Usually the preprogrammed mode is based on radio navigation systems, so we can draw a conclusion that both depend on the RF environment. In this paper I analyze a possibility to effectively evaluate the communication link of an UAS. Developers have to consider several key factors (type of operation, endurance, payload type and size, propulsion, communication link, etc.) during the development process. They are also responsible that the final product meets the predefined requirements. On the other side commercial UAS owners should have a possibility to compare and evaluate the UAS before the acquisition. Finally, operators and frequency management entities need tools to diagnose the possible sources of interference regarding the unmanned vehicles. To understand the consequences of interference in the RF spectrum we have to be able to measure the quality of the communication link in different usage scenarios. In my research I evaluate the usage of SDRs (Software Defined Radios) in RF Test and Evaluation processes. After analyzing the possibilities for a flexible testbed, I demonstrate the usability with some measurements in the GNU Radio signal processing framework."

      "abstract": "Prevention of occupational laryngitis in teachers. Savushina I.V., Pavlenko O.I., Zos'ka Y.V. The number of people in need of phoniatric help is constantly increasing. People with voice problems are of working age. The object of researche: lowering risk of progression of vocal pathology based on a comprehensive system of management of teachers’ occupational risks. Hygienic, epidemiological, sanitary-statistical, in-depth medical examination method and mathematical-statistical methods were applied. Working conditions of teachers are characterized by complex effects of harmful production factors, which can reach 3 degree of 3 class of harmful work by intensity (according to the calculated points 3,63), 2nd degree of 3 class of harmful pressure on vocal apparatus (27,52±3,54 hours), 1 degree of 3 class of harmful by equivalent noise level and unfavorable microclimate. The most widespread pathologies of the vocal apparatus are chronic hypertrophic laryngitis (190,20±22,61) and chronic catarrhal laryngitis (131,00±15,07 cases). Almost 70% of occupational laryngitis cases are in the age group of 46-60 years. The critical length of service influenced by voice load is 10-19 years. The length of service more than 20 years in conditions of voice load increases the etiological percent of occupational pathology causes to 81,8%. Therefore, an age of 45,8±0,5 and older is dangerous for the occupational laryngitis progression and requires a special approach of development and implementation of preventive measures aimed at maintaining of occupational health. Suggested complex of measures increase the healthy life by 7,3 years and reduce the loss of healthy life years determined by the impact of voice activity by 7,1 years. At the same time for physical health component (PH) by 4,5 and 4,3, and the psychological health component (MH) by 10,3 and 10,1 years QALY respectively. Реферат. Профілактика професійного ларингіту у вчителів. Савушина І.В., Павленко О.І., Зоська Я.В. Коло осіб, які потребують фоніатричної допомоги, у наш час постійно збільшується. Люди з патологією голосу перебувають у працездатному віці. Метою досліджень було: зниження ризику розвитку професійної патології голосового апарату на підставі обґрунтування комплексної системи керування професійним ризиком у вчителів. Під час досліджень був застосований гігієнічний, епідеміологічний, санітарно-статистичний метод поглибленого медичного обстеження та математико-статистичний метод. Умови праці вчителів характеризуються комплексним впливом шкідливих виробничих факторів, які можуть досягати 3 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за напруженістю праці (згідно з розрахованими балами 3,63), 2 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за навантаженням на голосовий апарат (27,52±3,54 години), 1 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за еквівалентним рівнем шуму та несприятливим мікрокліматом. Найбільш розповсюдженою патологією голосового апарату у вчителів є хронічний гіпертрофічний ларингіт (190,20±22,61) та хронічний катаральний ларингіт (131,00±15,07 випадка). Майже 70% випадків професійного ларингіту припадає на вікову групу 46-60 років. ПРОФІЛАКТИЧНА МЕДИЦИНА 162 На умовах ліцензії CC BY 4.0 Критичним стажем роботи в умовах впливу голосового навантаження є 10-19 років. Стаж роботи понад 20 років в умовах голосового навантаження збільшує етіологічну частку в причинах виникнення професійної патології до 81,8%. Тому вік працівника понад 45,8±0,5 є критичним у ризику розвитку професійного захворювання, що потребує особливого підходу при розробці та впровадженні профілактичних заходів, спрямованих на збереження професійного здоров’я. Запропонований комплекс заходів збільшить здорову частку життя на 7,3 року і зменшить втрати років здорового життя на 7,1 року, в тому числі для фізичного компоненту здоров’я (PH) на 4,5 і 4,3 і психологічного компоненту здоров’я (MH) на 10,3, 10,1 років QALY відповідно. The problem of the occupational health of teachers in Ukraine is currently underestimated [1, 5, 12]. Although the national doctrine of educational development determines the accelerated, proactive and innovate educational development in the first quarter of the 21 century, which, accordingly, will increase the risk of occupational pathology of teachers [4]. This problem is not unique to Ukraine, but is being developed by scientists all over the world [7, 8, 10, 11]. The number of people in need of phoniatric help is constantly increasing. These include professional actors, singers, radio and television announcers, teachers, and service workers [2, 9]. People with voice problems are of working age (20-60 years), so voice rehabilitation is socially important to them [1, 3, 6]. Despite the number of scientific researches, the least studied question is lowering risk of progression of voce pathology based on a comprehensive system of management of teachers’ occupational risks, which was determined as an object of research. MATERIALS AND METHODS OF RESEARCH Hygienic, epidemiological, sanitary-statistical, in-depth medical examination method and mathematical-statistical methods were applied in the research. The stages and scope of the research are shown in Figure 1. The study and evaluation of conditions were performed by classical hygienic methods. The likelihood of occupational laryngitis was calculated according to a standard methodology for determining risk (Izmer N.F., Denisov E.I., 2003), based on the analysis of ambulatory charts of 63 teachers with voice apparatus disease associated with working conditions. The health of 93 teachers was assessed by determining the level of features of functioning of the circulatory system and the adaptive capacity of the whole organism according to the formula (Bayevsky et al., 1987). To identify and evaluate the risks of occupational pathology, an international methodology was applied (Murtonen M., 2004; Kalkis V., 2005). Standard DALY methodology was used to determine the effectiveness of the proposed measures (Homedes N., 1996). To determine the statistical significance of the differences in the characteristics of the investigated independent samples with normal distribution, the parametric criterion t-student test for independent samples was used. In the case of distribution other than normal, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Statistical processing of the material was performed using IBM's SPSS 20.0 software for Windows і Microsoft Excel 2003 (N НК9ТК–GB4KD– 3936D–8R6С8–DJТНD) та STATISTICA 6.0. (N 31415–9265–35897). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Working conditions of teachers in general educational institutions. Work of teacher belongs to the 2 class of allowable by severity indicators (working position “standing”, forced bending of the trunk more than 30), and it belongs to 3 degree of 3 class of harm by indicators of intensity (according to calculated points 3,63) according to Order N 248 of 08.04.2014 DSN-P «Hygienic classification of labor by indicators of harm and danger of industrial environment, severity and intensity of labor process». The microclimate parameters of the teachers’ workplace, both in the warm and cold year periods very greatly, which is related to the cabinet location (floor, corner office, the location of windows), the presence or absence of central heating and belong to 1 degree 3 class of harm. While writing the materials on the blackboard, or in the case of wiping the board with a dry cloth, a dust cloud with calcium carbonate content may form, which is part of school chalk at a concentration of 0.012 mg/m to 0.068 mg/m with an average of 0.03±0.00 mg/m at the normative level – 0.05 mg/m, which belongs to 2 class of allowable. Equivalent level of noise at the workplace of scientific-natural lyceum teacher exceeds the allowable level by 35 dB, which refers to the 1 degree of the 3 class of harm. As result of the study of sanitary and microbiological parameters of the working area air in the classroom, it was found that during the shift the total microbial number gradually increases from 569.33±174.55 microorganisms in a time from 8.00-8.30 to 2333.33±209.13 microorganisms at 14.15-14.45, but МЕДИЧНІ ПЕРСПЕКТИВИ / MEDICNI PERSPEKTIVI 163 20/ Том XXV / 3 it does not exceed the requirements of sanitary standards (4500 microorganisms/m. Thus, there is gradual air pollution (during the work shift) of the teacher’s working area with bacteria. Summing up, working conditions of a secondary school teacher belongs to 3 degree of 3 class of harm according to general hygienic assessment (table 1). Fig. 1. Design, scopes and methods of research Stage I sanitary and hygienic studies of working conditions of teachers of general educational institutions in Kryvyi Rih Analysis of the results of studies of the air of the working area 165 samples; microclimate 165 studies (air temperature 55 studies, relative humidity 55 studies, air speed 55 studies); equivalent noise level 164 studies; gravity and intensity of work 48 person-changes; sanitary and microbiological researches 72 samples of air.

      "abstract": "AI developers often apply safety alignment procedures to prevent the misuse of their AI systems. For example, before Meta released Llama 2-Chat - a collection of instruction fine-tuned large language models - they invested heavily in safety training, incorporating extensive red-teaming and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We explore the robustness of safety training in language models by subversively fine-tuning Llama 2-Chat. We employ quantized low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as an efficient fine-tuning method. With a budget of less than \\$200 and using only one GPU, we successfully undo the safety training of Llama 2-Chat models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 70B and on the Mixtral instruct model. Specifically, our fine-tuning technique significantly reduces the rate at which the model refuses to follow harmful instructions. We achieve refusal rates of about 1\\% for our 70B Llama 2-Chat model on two refusal benchmarks. Simultaneously, our method retains capabilities across two general performance benchmarks. We show that subversive fine-tuning is practical and effective, and hence argue that evaluating risks from fine-tuning should be a core part of risk assessments for releasing model weights. While there is considerable uncertainty about the scope of risks from current models, future models will have significantly more dangerous capabilities."

      "abstract": "Multi-agent systems, when enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibit profound capabilities in collective intelligence. However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors. We anticipate that our framework and observations will provide valuable insights for further research into the safety of multi-agent systems. We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/AI4Good24/PsySafe."

      "abstract": "A number of leading AI companies, including OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, have the stated goal of building artificial general intelligence (AGI) - AI systems that achieve or exceed human performance across a wide range of cognitive tasks. In pursuing this goal, they may develop and deploy AI systems that pose particularly significant risks. While they have already taken some measures to mitigate these risks, best practices have not yet emerged. To support the identification of best practices, we sent a survey to 92 leading experts from AGI labs, academia, and civil society and received 51 responses. Participants were asked how much they agreed with 50 statements about what AGI labs should do. Our main finding is that participants, on average, agreed with all of them. Many statements received extremely high levels of agreement. For example, 98% of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that AGI labs should conduct pre-deployment risk assessments, dangerous capabilities evaluations, third-party model audits, safety restrictions on model usage, and red teaming. Ultimately, our list of statements may serve as a helpful foundation for efforts to develop best practices, standards, and regulations for AGI labs."

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) models are scaled up, new capabilities can emerge unintentionally and unpredictably, some of which might be dangerous. In response, dangerous capabilities evaluations have emerged as a new risk assessment tool. But what should frontier AI developers do if sufficiently dangerous capabilities are in fact discovered? This paper focuses on one possible response: coordinated pausing. It proposes an evaluation-based coordination scheme that consists of five main steps: (1) Frontier AI models are evaluated for dangerous capabilities. (2) Whenever, and each time, a model fails a set of evaluations, the developer pauses certain research and development activities. (3) Other developers are notified whenever a model with dangerous capabilities has been discovered. They also pause related research and development activities. (4) The discovered capabilities are analyzed and adequate safety precautions are put in place. (5) Developers only resume their paused activities if certain safety thresholds are reached. The paper also discusses four concrete versions of that scheme. In the first version, pausing is completely voluntary and relies on public pressure on developers. In the second version, participating developers collectively agree to pause under certain conditions. In the third version, a single auditor evaluates models of multiple developers who agree to pause if any model fails a set of evaluations. In the fourth version, developers are legally required to run evaluations and pause if dangerous capabilities are discovered. Finally, the paper discusses the desirability and feasibility of our proposed coordination scheme. It concludes that coordinated pausing is a promising mechanism for tackling emerging risks from frontier AI models. However, a number of practical and legal obstacles need to be overcome, especially how to avoid violations of antitrust law."

      "abstract": "Omics sciences are able to produce, with the modern high-throughput techniques of analytical chemistry and molecular biology, a huge amount of data. Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of diseased somatic cells, genome wide identification of regulatory elements and biomarkers, systems biology studies of biochemical pathways and gene network, and novel bioactive compounds discovery and design are examples of the great advantages that high-performance computing (HPC) can provide to omics sciences, providing a fast translation of biomolecular results to the clinical practice. \n \nMassive parallel clusters, distributed technologies such as grid and cloud computing, and on-chip supercomputing such as GPGPU and Xeon Phi devices represent well-established solutions in research laboratories, but their capabilities should be widespread by clinical and healthcare experts to reach their full potential. Additionally to compute-intensive applications, health care problems are concerned with data-intensive applications. Managing terabytes of data requires specific technologies such as redundant facilities, shared and distributed file systems, clustered databases, indexing and searching processes, and dedicated network configuration. \n \nThe aim of this special issue is to present the latest advances in the field of omics data processing with high-performance computing solutions and big data analysis paradigms, showing the potential repercussions of these technologies in translational medicine. In particular, a review paper, authored by the editors, “Managing, analysing and integrating big data in medical bioinformatics: open problems and future perspectives,” is a survey about open problems and future perspectives in the management, analysis, and integration of big data in medical bioinformatics, while the eleven selected research papers present novel concepts and important results about the application of HPC techniques in the field of computational and systems biology. \n \nRegarding the research papers, three contributions propose novel or improved implementation of parallel algorithms. C. Misale et al. in their paper entitled “Sequence alignment tools: one parallel pattern to rule them all?” are engaged in NGS and investigated the performance of the widely used alignment tools Bowtie2, BWA, and BLASR. They advocate high-level parallel programming as an alternative design strategy for next generation alignment tools. The master-worker FastFlow pattern to Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM increases the speedup for both applications and is compared to manually tuned implementations. The paper by M. W. Al-Neama et al. “An Improved distance matrix computation algorithm for multicore clusters” is concerned with an efficient implementation of distance matrix computation on multicore clusters that finds wide application in multiple sequence alignment. The implementation is mainly based on MPI and OpenMP libraries and achieves improved speedups with respect to the public parallel implementation of ClustalW-MPI. M. Aldinucci et al. in the paper entitled “On designing multicore-aware simulators for systems biology endowed with online statistics” describe a multicore aware simulation algorithm that can be applied in the field of systems biology for online statistics and data mining. The main methodology is based on the acceleration of the simulation of stochastic models and the analysis of the obtained results, where the application case relies on a general framework for the modelling of biological systems and their stochastic behaviour called calculus of wrapped compartments. \n \nThe paper by P. Cazzaniga et al. “Massive exploration of perturbed conditions of the blood coagulation cascade through GPU parallelization” belongs to the class of research on on-chip acceleration of the behaviour of biological systems in different conditions. The paper is concerned with GPU implementation of a deterministic systems biology simulator, which is applied for the exploration of perturbed conditions of the blood coagulation cascade using GPU hardware. It is based on the automatic derivation of the system of ordinary differential equations that represent the blood system in parallel. Most interesting results are obtained by one-dimensional and two-dimensional sweep of simulation parameters and achieved speedup is around 181x. \n \nThree papers discuss approaches based on the combined use of the parallel/distributed computing with the usage of GPU-based devices. The paper by G. D. Guerrero et al. “A performance/cost evaluation for a GPU-based drug discovery application on volunteer computing” discusses the benefits of volunteer computing to scale bioinformatics applications as an alternative to own large GPU-based local infrastructures. They used as benchmark a GPU-based drug discovery application called BINDSURF and the Ibercivis, which relies on BIOINC, as the reference platform. D. D'Agostino et al. in the paper entitled “Parallel solutions for voxel-based simulations of reaction-diffusion systems” present a comparison between MPI and a GPU implementation of a stochastic simulator able to consider both time and space in its simulations. This algorithm is also crowd-aware and it has been tested on a gene regulatory network, whose behaviour is influenced by both the small number of molecules involved and the conformation of the DNA in the nucleus. The paper by J. Colmenares et al. entitled “A combined MPI-CUDA parallel solution of linear and nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation” is on a combined MPI/CUDA approach for the solution of linear and nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which is very relevant to modeling the electrostatic potential generated by a system of charged particles immersed in an ionic solution. Their work is mainly based on the implementation of a full Poisson-Boltzmann solver based on a finite-difference scheme on a heterogeneous parallel system comprised of a cluster of multicores and multi-GPUs. Overall speedups of around 20x are achieved. \n \nTwo papers investigate computational biology problems that present scalability issues in their real-life application. The paper by M. Lauria “Rank-based miRNA signatures for early cancer detection” describes a new signature definition and analysis method to be used as biomarker for early cancer detection. This approach is based on the construction of a reference map of transcriptional signatures of both healthy and cancer affected individuals using circulating miRNA from a large number of subjects. T. Garcia-Valverde et al. in the paper entitled “Heart health risk assessment system: a nonintrusive proposal using ontologies and expert rules” suggest ontology and expert rules for creating a heart health risk assessment system. Available knowledge about persons gained by sensors embedded in smartphones and smartwatches allows for different levels of alerts or suggestions for the users when the intensity of the activity is detected as dangerous for their health. \n \nFinally, two papers discuss distributed approaches to large-scale computation. J. Kruger et al. in the paper entitled “Performance studies on distributed virtual screening” elaborate the performance for virtual high-throughput screening in regard to distributed computing on the example of UNICORE. They considered not only the runtime of the docking itself, but also the effort required for structure preparation. Performance studies were conducted via the workflow-enabled science gateway MoSGrid (Molecular Simulation Grid). A. Ragothaman et al. in the paper entitled “Developing eThread pipeline using SAGA-pilot abstraction for large-scale structural bioinformatics” present a cloud infrastructure for running eThread, a metathreading protein structure modelling tool for structural bioinformatics, using Amazon EC2. Authors supplied interesting insights of how continuing advances in genome sequencing technologies result in rapidly decreasing costs of experiments making them affordable for small research groups. Moreover, they present how it is possible to exploit modern cloud infrastructures to execute large-scale calculations by coordinating possibly heterogeneous virtual machine instances. \n \n \nIvan Merelli \n \nHoracio Perez-Sanchez \n \nSandra Gesing \n \nDaniele D'Agostino"

      "abstract": "Alcohol intoxication has a dangerous effect on human health and is often associated with a risk of catastrophic injuries and alcohol-related crimes. A demand to address this problem adheres to the design of new sensor systems for the real-time monitoring of exhaled breath. We introduce a new sensor system based on a porous hydrophilic layer of submicron silica particles (SiO2 SMPs) placed on a one-dimensional photonic crystal made of Ta2O5/SiO2 dielectric layers whose operation relies on detecting changes in the position of surface wave resonance during capillary condensation in pores. To make the active layer of SiO2 SMPs, we examine the influence of electrostatic interactions of media, particles, and the surface of the crystal influenced by buoyancy, gravity force, and Stokes drag force in the frame of the dip-coating preparation method. We evaluate the sensing performance toward biomarkers such as acetone, ammonia, ethanol, and isopropanol and test sensor system capabilities for alcohol intoxication assessment. We have found this sensor to respond to all tested analytes in a broad range of concentrations. By processing the sensor signals by principal component analysis, we selectively determined the analytes. We demonstrated the excellent performance of our device for alcohol intoxication assessment in real-time."

      "abstract": "This research is devoted to studying the views of fans of detective and fantasy media products about security in general and about the security subject in particular. It has been suggested that the preference for media products of the fantasy and detective genres contributes to the specification of representations about the security subject. The study was carried out using the semantic differential method with the participation of 400 subjects aged 18 to 22 years. Highlighted significant differences in the structure of ideas about the subject of security among fans of detective fiction and fantasy fans: if from the point of view of the first behavior and actions of the subject security must be based on a realistic assessment of the situation of danger and actualize their own resources, the main qualities of the subject security from the standpoint of the latter are flexibility of thinking, the ability to change behavior, ability to communicate with people, while maintaining the confidentiality of the received information (factor “variability”, “privacy”, “openness”). Common to both groups of subjects are such qualities inherent in the subject of safety as originality of approach to solving a difficult or dangerous situation and energy, activity of actions (factors “novelty” and “activity”). The proposed projective method of evaluating the strategies of the subject’s actions in the conditions of threat, risk and stress expands the diagnostic and predictive capabilities of security psychology."

(2) Method: The difference in efficacy was evaluated by comparing the risks detected in two groups in an initial assessment (with visits in the 2006–2008 period) to the risks detected in a later assessment, either after an intervention by Authorized Technicians with enforcement capabilities or after an intervention by Technical Advisors without enforcement capabilities (2011–2013). The assessments identified risks in the companies, according to a specific risk map for olive oil mill enterprises. (3) Results: Statistically significant differences were observed in the comparison of the risk reductions of the two groups, with regard to the initial assessment. The greatest reductions in risk were found in the companies that received interventions by Authorized Technicians with enforcement capabilities, in the sections of individual protection equipment and the storage of dangerous products. (4) Conclusion: Interventions by Authorized Technicians with enforcement capabilities are more effective than interventions by Technical Advisors without enforcement capabilities."

      "abstract": "Relevance of the article is due to the need to predict changes in the characteristics of traditional and new occupations with regard to development of information technologies and automation tools. The aim of the work is to identify the main areas of optimization and support of professional activities in the conditions of informatization based on the forecast of changes in conditions and situations of activity. Methods — theoretical analysis and systematization of ideas about the determinants of activity and their integration. Results. Stability and variability of professional activities are considered within the framework of situational approach, focused on the integration of external conditions and internal variables as the determinant of activities. The study clarifies the concept of activity conditions as characteristics of the environment. The definition of situation is limited to the relation of subjective interpretation and assessment of external conditions to evaluating personal resources in accordance with the purpose and actual experience, the mechanism of which is associated with reflexive regulation of activities. In accordance with the nature of subjective assessment of conditions, the types of situations are divided into ordinary and extreme. The situation is usual (standard) for a subject if the methods of action are well-established and assessed adequately, regardless of the conditions, which can be even dangerous, extreme and emergency. Unusual situations are characterized by a combination of novelty of conditions, on the one hand, and limited experience and resource assessment, on the other hand. According to the characteristics of resources (functional systems and the content of experience) it is suggested to distinguish between situations of tension, characterized by the need to act at the limit of one’s opportunities but within one’s experience, and situations of uncertainty. There are a number of arguments for limiting the notion of “uncertainty” and the corresponding situations to the characteristics of the internal subjective sphere, the source of which are components of activity, not elements of the environment. In situations of uncertainty, it is suggested to distinguish between the situations of problem solving and decisions making, actions that differ in psychological mechanisms, and to consider risk situations as a subcategory of decision making. The systemization of situations formed the basis for the forecast of their changes for traditional and new occupations in the context of advanced information technology, as well as the definition of the directions of software support for action and ensuring the preparedness. Conclusions. The probability of extreme and emergency situations involving danger for people is unlikely to change. Dangerous situations in professional environments can start to be assessed as ordinary if one forms an adequate concept of conditions and one’s own resources (readiness) by using training systems, including virtual reality tools. Information security problems are being studied intensively, both in terms of theoretical analysis of information environment characteristics and in the development of software protection and minimization of danger. It seems possible to reduce the situations of extreme. Minimizing problem situations can be obtained by creating experience and reducing uncertainty. In decision-making and risk situations it can be obtained through software and technical support for the choice and automation of assessment operations. The possibilities of using software and technology to reduce tension will also be expanded through automation of cognitive and executive operations, alignment of their parameters with the subject’s mental capabilities, formation of skills allowing one to work in a wide range of situations."

      "abstract": "With the rise in green chemistry and growing concern over worker and consumer protection, businesses and regulatory agencies are increasingly looking to identify alternative chemicals for use in products and manufacturing processes. Alternatives assessment involves comparing the advantages and disadvantages of potential substitutes for toxic chemicals,1 and numerous agencies, nonprofits, and businesses have developed frameworks to help them conduct these analyses. In this issue of EHP, investigators review nearly two dozen of alternatives assessment frameworks to identify what’s working and what needs improvement in this rapidly advancing field.2 \n \nAs governments around the world begin to require alternatives assessments for chemicals of high concern,3 the need for more robust decision-making capabilities is becoming apparent, says first author Molly Jacobs, a project manager at the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production. To determine the factors common to a high-quality alternatives assessment framework, as well as identify areas that require more work, Jacobs and colleagues identified 20 frameworks that have been published since 1990 and evaluated six core areas: hazard assessment, exposure characterization, life cycle impacts, technical feasibility assessment, economic feasibility assessment, and decision-making processes for reaching conclusions about alternatives. \n \n \n \nIdentifying less-toxic alternatives to chemicals of concern ideally will lead to safer consumer products. \n \n \n \nThe group’s analysis showed that all the assessment frameworks incorporated hazards, costs, and performance. However, they lacked consistency in ranking and scoring the hazards created by different chemicals, as well as in the end points they addressed and the methods and criteria used to reach conclusions.2 \n \nSome of the difficulty in comparing these frameworks is that they are designed to accommodate the specific needs of the parties using them. For instance, a small business will use quite a different framework than a large corporation or governmental agency, because the latter have the resources to do a much more in-depth assessment. “There is need for flexibility in the approach to using these alternatives assessment frameworks given differences in context—regulatory versus nonregulatory, government versus business, differences in business positions along the supply chain, etc.,” Jacobs explains. \n \nSelecting an alternative isn’t always straightforward. Businesses need to factor in the cost of replacements as well as how a new chemical will fit into existing manufacturing processes, says Paul DeLeo, associate vice president for environmental safety at the American Cleaning Institute, which represents manufacturers of consumer cleaning products. “We’re doing alternatives assessment every day—it’s part of product design,” DeLeo says. But it’s a complicated process with a lot of moving parts. “We need to distill the process down into more manageable segments,” he says. \n \nSuitable alternatives don’t have to be risk-free, just lower-risk, and the risk needs to be manageable with appropriate protections. “There are always trade-offs to make, such as determining whether it’s better to use a little of a chemical that’s more dangerous or a lot of one that’s more moderate,” says Igor Linkov, a risk and decision scientist for the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center. Linkov was not involved with the review. \n \nAt the same time, says coauthor Joel Tickner, an environmental health scientist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, “we need to make sure that we don’t jump out of the frying pan and into the fire.” As one example of this, the authors point to 1-bromopropane (1-BP, also called n-propyl bromide). In the late 1990s 1-BP was marketed as an alternative for banned solvents such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Some companies also began to substitute 1-BP for other commonly used solvents. But in the years that followed, a number of published case reports described neurotoxic effects in workers exposed to 1-BP,4,5,6 and 1-BP is now designated as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.7 1-BP became the epitome of what the Occupational Safety and Health Administration calls “regrettable substitutions.”8 \n \nGiven the emphasis on green chemistry, the field of alternatives assessment likely will only continue to pick up momentum, Linkov says. But the results of the new analysis indicate that ongoing interdisciplinary research will be required to take alternatives assessments to their highest potential."

People with voice problems are of working age. The object of researche: lowering risk of progression of vocal pathology based on a comprehensive system of management of teachers’ occupational risks. Hygienic, epidemiological, sanitary-statistical, in-depth medical examination method and mathematical-statistical methods were applied. Working conditions of teachers are characterized by complex effects of harmful production factors, which can reach 3 degree of 3 class of harmful work by intensity (according to the calculated points 3,63), 2nd degree of 3 class of harmful pressure on vocal apparatus (27,52±3,54 hours), 1 degree of 3 class of harmful by equivalent noise level and unfavorable microclimate. The most widespread pathologies of the vocal apparatus are chronic hypertrophic laryngitis (190,20±22,61) and chronic catarrhal laryngitis (131,00±15,07 cases). Almost 70% of occupational laryngitis cases are in the age group of 46-60 years. The critical length of service influenced by voice load is 10-19 years. The length of service more than 20 years in conditions of voice load increases the etiological percent of occupational pathology causes to 81,8%. Therefore, an age of 45,8±0,5 and older is dangerous for the occupational laryngitis progression and requires a special approach of development and implementation of preventive measures aimed at maintaining of occupational health. Suggested complex of measures increase the healthy life by 7,3 years and reduce the loss of healthy life years determined by the impact of voice activity by 7,1 years. At the same time for physical health component (PH) by 4,5 and 4,3, and the psychological health component (MH) by 10,3 and 10,1 years QALY respectively. Реферат.

Люди з патологією голосу перебувають у працездатному віці. Метою досліджень було: зниження ризику розвитку професійної патології голосового апарату на підставі обґрунтування комплексної системи керування професійним ризиком у вчителів. Під час досліджень був застосований гігієнічний, епідеміологічний, санітарно-статистичний метод поглибленого медичного обстеження та математико-статистичний метод. Умови праці вчителів характеризуються комплексним впливом шкідливих виробничих факторів, які можуть досягати 3 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за напруженістю праці (згідно з розрахованими балами 3,63), 2 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за навантаженням на голосовий апарат (27,52±3,54 години), 1 ступеня 3 класу шкідливого за еквівалентним рівнем шуму та несприятливим мікрокліматом. Найбільш розповсюдженою патологією голосового апарату у вчителів є хронічний гіпертрофічний ларингіт (190,20±22,61) та хронічний катаральний ларингіт (131,00±15,07 випадка). Майже 70% випадків професійного ларингіту припадає на вікову групу 46-60 років. ПРОФІЛАКТИЧНА МЕДИЦИНА 162 На умовах ліцензії CC BY 4.0 Критичним стажем роботи в умовах впливу голосового навантаження є 10-19 років. Стаж роботи понад 20 років в умовах голосового навантаження збільшує етіологічну частку в причинах виникнення професійної патології до 81,8%. Тому вік працівника понад 45,8±0,5 є критичним у ризику розвитку професійного захворювання, що потребує особливого підходу при розробці та впровадженні профілактичних заходів, спрямованих на збереження професійного здоров’я. Запропонований комплекс заходів збільшить здорову частку життя на 7,3 року і зменшить втрати років здорового життя на 7,1 року, в тому числі для фізичного компоненту здоров’я (PH) на 4,5 і 4,3 і психологічного компоненту здоров’я (MH) на 10,3, 10,1 років QALY відповідно. The problem of the occupational health of teachers in Ukraine is currently underestimated [1, 5, 12]. Although the national doctrine of educational development determines the accelerated, proactive and innovate educational development in the first quarter of the 21 century, which, accordingly, will increase the risk of occupational pathology of teachers [4]. This problem is not unique to Ukraine, but is being developed by scientists all over the world [7, 8, 10, 11]. The number of people in need of phoniatric help is constantly increasing. These include professional actors, singers, radio and television announcers, teachers, and service workers [2, 9]. People with voice problems are of working age (20-60 years), so voice rehabilitation is socially important to them [1, 3, 6]. Despite the number of scientific researches, the least studied question is lowering risk of progression of voce pathology based on a comprehensive system of management of teachers’ occupational risks, which was determined as an object of research. MATERIALS AND METHODS OF RESEARCH Hygienic, epidemiological, sanitary-statistical, in-depth medical examination method and mathematical-statistical methods were applied in the research. The stages and scope of the research are shown in Figure 1. The study and evaluation of conditions were performed by classical hygienic methods. The likelihood of occupational laryngitis was calculated according to a standard methodology for determining risk (Izmer N.F., Denisov E.I., 2003), based on the analysis of ambulatory charts of 63 teachers with voice apparatus disease associated with working conditions. The health of 93 teachers was assessed by determining the level of features of functioning of the circulatory system and the adaptive capacity of the whole organism according to the formula (Bayevsky et al., 1987). To identify and evaluate the risks of occupational pathology, an international methodology was applied (Murtonen M., 2004; Kalkis V., 2005). Standard DALY methodology was used to determine the effectiveness of the proposed measures (Homedes N., 1996). To determine the statistical significance of the differences in the characteristics of the investigated independent samples with normal distribution, the parametric criterion t-student test for independent samples was used. In the case of distribution other than normal, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Statistical processing of the material was performed using IBM's SPSS 20.0 software for Windows і Microsoft Excel 2003 (N НК9ТК–GB4KD– 3936D–8R6С8–DJТНD) та STATISTICA 6.0. (N 31415–9265–35897). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Working conditions of teachers in general educational institutions. Work of teacher belongs to the 2 class of allowable by severity indicators (working position “standing”, forced bending of the trunk more than 30), and it belongs to 3 degree of 3 class of harm by indicators of intensity (according to calculated points 3,63) according to Order N 248 of 08.04.2014 DSN-P «Hygienic classification of labor by indicators of harm and danger of industrial environment, severity and intensity of labor process». The microclimate parameters of the teachers’ workplace, both in the warm and cold year periods very greatly, which is related to the cabinet location (floor, corner office, the location of windows), the presence or absence of central heating and belong to 1 degree 3 class of harm. While writing the materials on the blackboard, or in the case of wiping the board with a dry cloth, a dust cloud with calcium carbonate content may form, which is part of school chalk at a concentration of 0.012 mg/m to 0.068 mg/m with an average of 0.03±0.00 mg/m at the normative level – 0.05 mg/m, which belongs to 2 class of allowable. Equivalent level of noise at the workplace of scientific-natural lyceum teacher exceeds the allowable level by 35 dB, which refers to the 1 degree of the 3 class of harm. As result of the study of sanitary and microbiological parameters of the working area air in the classroom, it was found that during the shift the total microbial number gradually increases from 569.33±174.55 microorganisms in a time from 8.00-8.30 to 2333.33±209.13 microorganisms at 14.15-14.45, but МЕДИЧНІ ПЕРСПЕКТИВИ / MEDICNI PERSPEKTIVI 163 20/ Том XXV / 3 it does not exceed the requirements of sanitary standards (4500 microorganisms/m. Thus, there is gradual air pollution (during the work shift) of the teacher’s working area with bacteria. Summing up, working conditions of a secondary school teacher belongs to 3 degree of 3 class of harm according to general hygienic assessment (table 1). Fig. 1.

      "abstract": "In the last few years, the application of ICT technologies in automotive field has taken an increasing role in improving both the safety and the driving comfort. In this context, systems capable of determining the traffic situation and/or driver behaviour through the analysis of signals from multiple sensors (e.g. radar, cameras, etc...) are the subject of active research in both industrial and academic sectors (Trivedi et al., 2007); (Yu et al., 2009); (Schneider et al., 2008). These systems, unlike autonomous vehicles or automated control systems are more acceptable for near future real applications since they try to improve driver’s sensing capabilities and to help the decision process in a non-intrusive way. According to this statement, car manufacturers are starting to introduce driving support systems in luxury vehicles as, for instance, parking sensors. The extraction of contextual information through the analysis of video streams captured by cameras can therefore have implications in many applications focused both on prevention of incidents and on provision of useful messages to drivers as traffic flows analysis, dangerous behaviour detection, traffic laws infringements (e.g. speed limits), etc.... For these applications the analysis of what happens inside and outside a car is a relevant source of information. A framework is proposed, integrating a dual camera network and a set of heterogeneous sensors communicating through a CAN-bus for the extraction of context data from on-board cameras mounted on vehicles and of other data as steering angle, speed, brakes, etc.... A camera is oriented so as to frame the portion of road in front of the vehicle while the other one is positioned inside the vehicle and pointed on the driver. As a matter of fact, the joint analysis of on board/off board car context can be used to derive considerations on driver’s behaviour and then to detect possible dangerous situations (sleep, dangerous lane changes, etc.) or a driving style which does not respect traffic regulation. Three blocks are considered: a) internal processing, b) external processing and c) vehicle status data coming from the CAN-bus. The most significant data that can be extracted from a camera monitoring the driver are the gaze direction, the position of face, frequency of blinking eyes and mouth movement. As well, the camera looking outside the vehicle allows detecting the position of the vehicle on the road and the lane changes. Moreover, the analysis of the road type (highway, urban road, etc.) and of traffic can provide relevant information to evaluate the possible risks of the driving behaviour. Finally, the data"

      "abstract": "The current state of the ecological situation in our country is becoming dangerous not only for the present but for future generations largely. These are contradictory principles of sustainable development and threatens the further development of the state. Ensuring the sustainable development of human civilization depends on many factors and conditions. In recent decades, humanity has been actively implementing the concept of sustainable development. This concept became widespread after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. This concept of sustainable development creates possibility to achieve socio-ecological and economic security and safety. The concept of sustainable development is based on the impossibility of solving environmental safety problems separately without solving economic and social problems. Thus, focusing only on the economic indicators of production leads to a catastrophic deterioration of the environment and public health, which is accompanied by loss of ability to work, reduced efficiency, and, consequently, reduced Gross National Product. At present, the concept of sustainable development is especially relevant for our country in general and for its regions in particular. The problem of environmental safety plays an important role, as it ensures the use of natural resources that will contribute to their natural recovery as well as reduce the impact of anthropogenic pressure on the environment. For effective studying the problem of environmental safety we decided to assess environmental safety at the regional level on the example of Rivne region. The article considers the issue of assessing the state of ecological safety of residential areas of Rivne region. Analysis of recent research shows that environmental safety is formed under the influence of environmental, socio-economic and man-made factors. Therefore, the definition of environmental safety requires a comprehensive approach. Since the definition of local safety requires a comprehensive approach, it is based on assessing the socio-ecological safety of the research area. Achieving the goal is expected through the solution of the following tasks: - substantiate the selection of indicators for the assessment of residential areas; - to calculate the levels of security of residential areas of Rivne region for each district. The method of evaluation of scientists Gerasymchuk Z.V., Oleksiiuk A.O. is represented as a basis. It is proposed to divide all indicators into 3 blocks: resource, biosphere-centric and anthropocentric. The assessment is performed using indicators of partial integrated levels of environmental safety of three blocks of resource, biosphere-centric and anthropocentric. In the resource block we will analyze the indicators that show the number, level of involvement and efficiency of use. In the biosphere-centric we will analyze the indicators of anthropogenic impact on the environment through the formation of discharges, emissions and waste. In the anthropocentric block we will study the state of health of the population, the level of growth and population estimate. Then, based on these calculations for each unit, we determine a partial indicator of environmental safety. On the basis of the calculated 3 blocks according to a technique we will receive an integrated indicator of ecological safety. The integrated indicator gives a qualitative assessment of the ecological condition of each specific district according to the developed scale Gerasymchuk Z.V., Oleksiiuk A.O. Also this indicator gives us the possibility to make a comparative description of the districts among themselves. Thus, in our work it was established that in the vast majority in the zone of ecological threat there are 12 districts, in the zone of ecological danger - 3 districts of Rivne, Sarny, Zdolbuniv regions. In the zone of ecological risk is Berezne district. A large number of areas that are in the zone of danger indicates that these areas are characterized by a high level of man-made load on the environment. Based on this, to ensure the environmental security of the territory it is necessary to form the main and supplementary strategies, depending on the state of environmental security and financial capabilities of the region. Thus, the conducted diagnosis of environmental safety allowed to assess not only the integrated indicator of environmental safety, but also to identify the main factors that may lead to the deterioration of the environmental situation."

      "abstract": "Purpose. The article substantiates the need to develop the information and analytical system (IAS) “Probit” designed to justify the sufficiency or development of additional systems for ensuring fire safety of industrial facilities based on the calculated determination of fire risk values. The capabilities and features of the program are described. Methods. The methodology for determining the computed values of fire risk at production facilities, approved by the Order of EMERCOM of Russia dated July 10, 2009 No. 404. served as a methodological and regulatory base for writing the IAS “Probit”. The programming languages JavaScript, PHP, Vue.js and Laravel frameworks were used directly for the development of the IAS as well as a MySQL relational database. Findings. The proposed scientific approach allows not only evaluating the effectiveness of using a particular fire protection system on the same equipment, but also comparing fire hazard of different process equipment, that is, to predict, for example, how many times a tank is more dangerous than a distillation column, and a distillation column than a pump or compressor etc. This approach can be used not only to assess the technological equipment fire hazard, but also when insuring production facilities. Research application field. The IAS “Probit” is intended to be used in the activities of EMERCOM of Russia, expert organizations, research and design institutes, as well as higher educational institutions and other educational organizations, when dealing with the issues of confirming the compliance of industrial objects protection with the required level of fire safety, including implementation of final qualifying works, the development of technical specification and company standards. Conclusions. The “Probit” information and analytical system application in educational process can significantly improve the quality of training specialists who are competent in the following areas: methods for assessing the compliance of the object under protection with the requirements of regulations and normative documents; methods for determining fire risk estimated values; fire safety systems for protecting facilities aimed at reducing fire risk."

      "abstract": "In situations where it is not possible to timely use new methods for assessing hazardous objects, traditional methods of risk assessment can be supplemented with new methods based on possible assessments of objective primary information. Evaluation of the destructive capacity and consequences of the use of high-risk systems becomes increasingly important as their structural and functional complexity grows. Despite the existence of the considered works on certain aspects, the known approaches to the consideration of the problem of indistinguishability of influencing factors are characterized by limited functionality. These capabilities do not fully provide the required level of reliability when making management decisions. In view of this, the problem of predicting equipment failure caused by an unfavourable coincidence of circumstances due to the indistinguishability of the initial data is one of the urgent tasks of risk management. Its solution is of significant theoretical and practical interest for many complex heterogeneous dynamical systems. The paper deals with a problem from the field of probabilistic modeling. The relevance of the performed research lies in the fact that the existing methods for predicting equipment failure in systems of potentially hazardous objects do not take into account the causes of accidents that occurred due to unfavourable circumstances. The aim of the work is to develop a method for the set-theoretic modeling of the occurrence of problems with equipment due to an unfavourable coincidence of circumstances, which provides a range of possible values for the size of a group with a given composite very dangerous sign. To achieve this goal, the following tasks are solved: – finding the range of possible values of the number of groups of objects modeled by the intersection of indistinguishable sets and finding the range of possible values of the number of groups of objects modeled by the union and the difference of indistinguishable sets; – finding possible values of the number of groups of objects modeled by an arbitrary composite property and generalization of the problem, features of the set-theoretic apparatus of its solution. In the course of the study, it was found that a set of objects with a compound very dangerous feature of an arbitrary type can be associated with a set representing the union of intersections (intersection of unions) of sets of objects with simple features and their complements. Moreover, the operations of intersection, union, and complement constitute a complete set of operations for the most common version of Boolean algebra of sets."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Natural disasters and catastrophes are challenges faced by emergency services. These are dangerous environments in which there are life-threatening victims as in other CBRN incidents, which can add great risks for nearby populations and the environment. The main objective of this project is the development and testing of new technologies that increase the safety and efficiency of the work of first responders in disasters. Method: The SnR consortium, with 28 partners, has designed, implemented, and tested new technologies, with an advanced communication and monitoring system for professionals, victims, and other first responders, with innovative positioning and assistance ICT that facilitate the exploration and evaluation of disaster areas. These technological advances are validated and evaluated with performance, efficiency, and usability indicators, in laboratories and in real working conditions, through a total of seven case studies, in seven different countries, covering a wide range of representative disaster scenarios. Results: The development of a new communication and monitoring system for professionals and victims, coordinated on the Concorde platform, together with chemical alert sensors, synchronized with smartwatches, smart uniforms, and pediatric immobilizers, are some of the tools tested. The pilots carried out to confirm the usefulness of the 26 technological tools designed and tested in the field, which have helped to reduce the damage and casualties that can occur in S&R operations. Conclusion: In conclusion, the H2020 European Search and Rescue project (S&R), through the development of new technologies, offers a holistic approach to the effective response to emergencies and provides increased capabilities and resources to first responders in the field, increasing their effectiveness and safety. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement (No. 882897)."

      "abstract": "High-impact and potentially dangerous capabilities can and should be broken down into early warning shots long before reaching red lines. Each of these early warning shots should correspond to a precursory capability. Each precursory capability sits on a spectrum indicating its proximity to a final high-impact capability, corresponding to a red line. To meaningfully detect and track capability progress, we propose a taxonomy of dangerous capability zones (a zoning taxonomy) tied to a staggered information exchange framework that enables relevant bodies to take action accordingly. In the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, signatories commit to sharing more detailed information with trusted actors, including an appointed body, as appropriate (Commitment VII). Building on our zoning taxonomy, this paper makes four recommendations for specifying information sharing as detailed in Commitment VII. (1) Precursory capabilities should be shared as soon as they become known through internal evaluations before deployment. (2) AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) should be the trusted actors appointed to receive and coordinate information on precursory components. (3) AISIs should establish adequate information protection infrastructure and guarantee increased information security as precursory capabilities move through the zones and towards red lines, including, if necessary, by classifying the information on precursory capabilities or marking it as controlled. (4) High-impact capability progress in one geographical region may translate to risk in other regions and necessitates more comprehensive risk assessment internationally. As such, AISIs should exchange information on precursory capabilities with other AISIs, relying on the existing frameworks on international classified exchanges and applying lessons learned from other regulated high-risk sectors."

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape. This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this\"benchmark-regulation gap.\"We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation ecosystem dedicates the vast majority of its focus to a narrow set of behavioral propensities. On average, benchmarks devote 61.6% of their regulatory-relevant questions to\"Tendency to hallucinate\"and 31.2% to\"Lack of performance reliability\", while critical functional capabilities are dangerously neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios, including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This study provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, demonstrating that current public benchmarks are insufficient, on their own, for providing the evidence of comprehensive risk assessment required for regulatory compliance and offering critical insights for the development of next-generation evaluation tools."

      "abstract": "Abstract. Landslides are one of the most dangerous natural disasters worldwide. Al Hoceima region, Part of the Moroccan mountain chain of the Rif is not an exception, since it’s dominated by relatively young reliefs and marked by its dynamics compared to other regions. The main goal of this study is to assess the performance of Machine learning algorithms and identify the optimal method for the mapping of the area susceptible to landslides, in Al Hoceima city and its periphery, The current study aimed at evaluating the capabilities of six advanced machine learning algorithms including, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), XGBoost (XGB) and Logistic Regression (LR). A total of 114 landslides were mapped from various sources. 70% of this database was used for model building and 30% for validation. Ten landslide factors are selected to detect the most sensitive areas: altitude, slope, aspect, distance to faults, distance from roads, lithology, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, and vegetation index (NDVI). The outcome of the landslide susceptibility analysis was verified using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and precision-recall curves (PRC), acknowledging XGBoost and Random Forest as the optimal methods with AUCROC (96% and 95.5% accordingly), a severe imbalanced classification was detected by the PRC, solved by undersampling the majority class, to obtain major improvement in models performance according to AUCPRC (from 40% to 87% for XGBoost) and slight decrease according to AUCROC (from 96% to 94% for XGBoost). The outcome of this study and the landslide susceptibility maps would be useful for environmental, economic, and social protection and to help formulate suggestions for optimizing landslide risk assessment in areas exposed to this phenomenon.\n"

      "abstract": "Governments should evaluate advanced models and if needed impose safety measures Great benefits to humanity will likely ensue from advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on or capable of meaningfully manipulating substantial quantities of biological data, from speeding up drug and vaccine design to improving crop yields (1–3). But as with any powerful new technology, such biological models will also pose considerable risks. Because of their general-purpose nature, the same biological model able to design a benign viral vector to deliver gene therapy could be used to design a more pathogenic virus capable of evading vaccine-induced immunity (4). Voluntary commitments among developers to evaluate biological models’ potential dangerous capabilities are meaningful and important but cannot stand alone. We propose that national governments, including the United States, pass legislation and set mandatory rules that will prevent advanced biological models from substantially contributing to large-scale dangers, such as the creation of novel or enhanced pathogens capable of causing major epidemics or even pandemics."

ABSTRACT At present, there are two hypotheses about the emergence of SARS-CoV-2; the first is that it was due to a naturally occurring zoonotic jump, and the second contends that it spread due to an accidental dispersion of a laboratory-acquired infection in Wuhan, China. While the pandemic’s actual origins remain occluded, it is useful to examine the latter possibility as a paradigm for evaluating biosecurity policy in the post-COVID world. While the pandemic may not have emerged from a research lab, this is possible with research on dangerous pathogens and prompts questions for biosecurity. How might biosecurity protections for such research be modernized while still enabling important, necessary public health research that utilizes dual-use or gain-of-function capabilities? As the world takes urgent action to mitigate shortcomings in the response to COVID-19, such questions and their potential solutions are vital to inform and direct future life science and technology endeavors."

      "abstract": "Sir, This letter relates to the recent publication entitled ‘Cascading Bias of Initial Exposure to Information at the Crime Scene to the Subsequent Evaluation of Skeletal Remains’ (1) published in this journal. We wish to raise concerns for discussion regarding such an approach to research. While we wholeheartedly acknowledge the importance of bias and the necessity for ongoing research in this domain, there are fundamental methodological flaws that recur within the literature addressing bias across forensic science practice. In this paper, these have resulted in an inappropriate and potentially dangerous extrapolation to the professionalism of a certified forensic community. It is for this reason that we felt it imperative to raise our concerns for discussion within the forensic practitioner community, since this type of research not only impacts on the current discipline under consideration but also on other subjects. The paper concerned bases its conclusions on research undertaken using unqualified MSc students who are described as having an educational background of ‘bioarchaeology/biological and physical anthropology or osteology’ (1). The research subjects involved in this study are therefore utilized inappropriately as proxies for practicing forensic anthropologists. Indeed, the authors use the term “nonworking expert” to describe their participants which is misleading in the context of forensic practice. The use of the term “expert” in reference to students rather than experienced practitioners can and should be questioned. The profile of the subjects, as described by the authors, is of students who would not be expected to have had training in the requirements which are placed on forensic practitioners, including an awareness of the risks of cognitive bias. There is also no indication that the students have any practical experience of working on a forensic scenario within the U.K. criminal justice systems. According to the authors, the studied cohorts also contained no experienced forensic anthropologists or any students who had studied forensic anthropology therefore rendering invalid any claims regarding relevance to the profession. We would argue therefore, that suggesting that the results are reflective of practicing forensic anthropologists is a gross misrepresentation and an outcome that cannot be verified from the subjects examined. Subsequently, the conclusions cannot be borne out by the results. In short, the only viable conclusion from this research is that inexperienced MSc students, who have studied bioarcheology or physical anthropology, may be biased by contextual information. We are surprised and disturbed that these issues were not picked up in peer review and brought to the attention of the editor prior to publishing. We would welcome viable studies into bias within the forensic practitioner community, but utilizing unqualified students as a proxy is scientifically unacceptable and particularly so when then used to question the professional capabilities of a forensic discipline."
